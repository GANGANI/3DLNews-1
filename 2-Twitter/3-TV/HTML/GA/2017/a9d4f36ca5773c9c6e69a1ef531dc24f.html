Investigators trying to figure out why Stephen Paddock gunned down 59 people from his high-rise hotel suite are analyzing his computer and cellphone, looking at casino surveillance footage and seeking to interview his girlfriend.</p><p class="text | article-text">Nearly two days after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, what set off the 64-year-old high-rolling gambler and retired

Danley, is considered a "person of interest" and has been speaking with police from the Philippines, where she is traveling, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said.</p><div class="w-100"

fell.</p><p class="text | article-text">A dozen investigators, most in FBI jackets and all wearing blue booties to avoid contaminating the scene, documented evidence at the site where gunfire rained down Sunday night and country music gave way to screams of pain and terror.</p><p class="text | article-text">"Shoes, baby strollers, chairs, sunglasses, purses.

A woman pleaded with others: "Get down! Get down! Stay down!"</p><p class="text | article-text">Then the bang-bang-bang sounds resumed. And pure terror set in.</p><p class="text | article-text">"People start screaming and yelling and we start running," said Andrew Akiyoshi, who provided the cellphone video to The Associated Press. </p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"You could feel the panic. You could feel like the bullets were flying above us. Everybody's ducking down, running low to the ground."</p><p class="text | article-text">While some concertgoers hit the ground, others started pushing for the crowded exits, shoving through narrow gates and climbing over fences as 40- to 50-round bursts of what may have been automatic weapons fire rained down on them from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino hotel.</p><p class="text | article-text">By Monday afternoon, 59 people were dead and 527 wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.</p><p class="text | article-text">"You just didn't know what to do," Akiyoshi said. "Your heart is racing and you're thinking, 'I'm going to die.'"</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, a 64-year-old retiree from Mesquite, Nevada, killed himself before officers stormed Room 135 in the gold-colored glass skyscraper. He had 10 guns in the room where had been staying since Thursday.</p><p class="text | article-text">Asked about the motive for the attack, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said: "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point."</p><p class="text | article-text">The FBI said it found nothing so far to suggest the attack was connected to international terrorism, despite a claim of responsibility from the Islamic State group, which said Paddock was a "soldier" who had recently converted to Islam.</p><p class="text | article-text">In an address to the country, President Donald Trump called the bloodbath "an act of pure evil" and added: "In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has." He ordered flags flown at half-staff.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">With hospitals jammed with victims, authorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a "family reunification center" for people to find loved ones.</p><p class="text | article-text">The shooting began at 10:08 p.m., and the gunman appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes, according to radio traffic. Police frantically tried to locate him and determine whether the gunfire was coming from Mandalay Bay or the neighboring Luxor hotel.</p><p class="text | article-text">At 10:14 p.m., an officer said on his radio that he was pinned down against a wall on Las Vegas Boulevard with 40 to 50 people.</p><p class="text | article-text">"We can't worry about the victims," an officer said at 10:15 p.m. "We need to stop the shooter before we have more victims. Anybody have eyes on him ... stop the shooter."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Near the stage, Dylan Schneider, a country singer who performed earlier in the day, huddled with others under the VIP bleachers, where he turned to his manager and asked, "Dude, what do we do?" He said he repeated the question again and again over the next five minutes.</p><p class="text | article-text">Bodies were laid out on the artificial turf installed in front of the stage, and people were screaming and crying. The sound of people running on the bleachers added to the confusion, and Schneider thought the concert was being invaded with multiple shooters.</p><p class="text | article-text">"No one knew what to do," Schneider said. "It's literally running for life and you don't know what decision is the right one. But like I said, I knew we had to get out of there."</p><p class="text | article-text">He eventually pushed his way out of the crowd and found refuge in the nearby Tropicana hotel-casino, where he kicked in a door to an engineering room and spent hours there with others who followed him.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The shooting had begun as Aldean closed out the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival. He had just opened the song "When She Says Baby" and the first burst of nearly 50 shots crackled as he sang, "It's tough just getting up."</p><p class="text | article-text">He wasn't finished with the first verse when he abruptly stopped singing and hustled off the stage.</p><p class="text | article-text">Paddock apparently used a hammer-like device to smash out windows in his room and open fire. Muzzle flashes could be seen in the dark.</p><p class="text | article-text">"It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life," said Kodiak Yazzie, 36. "You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash, flash, flash, flash."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The crowd, funneled tightly into a wide-open space, had little cover and no easy way to escape. Victims fell to the ground while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands. Others crawled under parked cars.</p><p class="text | article-text">Couples held hands as they ran through the dirt lot. Faces were etched with shock and confusion, and people wept and screamed. Some were bloodied, and some were carried out by fellow concertgoers. Dozens of ambulances took away the wounded, while some people loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the hospital.</p><p class="text | article-text">Some of the injured were hit by shrapnel. Others were trampled.</p><p class="text | article-text">The dead included at least three off-duty police officers from various departments who were attending the concert, authorities said. Two on-duty officers were wounded, one critically, police said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said the Sunday night attack was the work of a "crazed lunatic full of hate."</p><p class="text | article-text">The sheriff said authorities believe Paddock acted alone. While Paddock appeared to have no criminal history, his father was a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list in the 1960s.</p><p class="text | article-text">As for why Paddock went on the murderous rampage, his brother in Florida, Eric Paddock, told reporters: "I can't even make something up. There's just nothing."</p><p class="text | article-text">Nearly every inch of the Las Vegas Strip is under video surveillance, much of it set up by the casinos to monitor their properties. That could yield a wealth of material for investigators as they try to piece together the attack.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Hours after the shooting, Aldean posted on Instagram that he and his crew were safe and that the shooting was "beyond horrific."</p><p class="text | article-text">"It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night," the country star said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Before Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in June 2016, when a gunman who professed support for Muslim extremist groups opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people.</p><p class="text | article-text">A suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, killed 22 people in May.

The attacker, Stephen Craig Paddock, a 64-year-old retiree from Mesquite, Nevada, had as many as 10 guns with him, including rifles.</p><p class="text | article-text">Country music star Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the gunman apparently used a hammer-like device to smash out windows in his room and opened fire, the muzzle flashes visible in the dark, authorities said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Hours after the shooting, Aldean posted on Instagram that he and his crew were safe and that the shooting was "beyond horrific."</p><div id="fusion-static-enter:MPTK3CA57ZES3KY37QSKCLNULY" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="MPTK3CA57ZES3KY37QSKCLNULY"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script></div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:MPTK3CA57ZES3KY37QSKCLNULY" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="MPTK3CA57ZES3KY37QSKCLNULY"></div><p class="text | article-text">The crowd, funneled tightly into a wide-open space, had little cover and no easy way to escape. Some victims fell to the ground, while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands. Others crawled under parked cars.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">After the first burst of gunfire, the music stopped, Aldean left the stage, and many of those in the crowd looked on in confusion. Then the shooting resumed about half a minute later.</p><p class="text | article-text">"It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life," said Kodiak Yazzie, 36. "You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash, flash, flash, flash."</p><p class="text | article-text">Monique Dumas, of British Columbia, Canada, said she was six rows from the stage when she heard what she thought was a bottle breaking, then a popping that sounded to her like fireworks.</p><p class="text | article-text">Couples held hands as they ran through the dirt lot. Faces were etched with shock and confusion, and people wept and screamed. Some were bloodied, and some were carried out by fellow concertgoers. Dozens of ambulances took away the wounded, while some people loaded victims into their cars and drove them to the hospital.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Some of the injured were hit by shrapnel. Others were trampled in the mass panic.</p><p class="text | article-text">The shooter appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes as Las Vegas police frantically tried to locate the man in one of the Mandalay Bay hotel towers, according to radio traffic. For several minutes, officers could not tell whether the fire was coming from Mandalay Bay or the neighboring Luxor hotel.</p><p class="text | article-text">Investigators gave few details on the weapons used but reported over the radio that they were faced with fully automatic fire.</p><p class="text | article-text">In an address to the country, President Donald Trump called the attack "an act of pure evil" and added: "In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has." He ordered flags flown at half-staff.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div id="fusion-static-enter:LPVCCKNZSVHIHERNWPHD6KGWHM" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="LPVCCKNZSVHIHERNWPHD6KGWHM"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:LPVCCKNZSVHIHERNWPHD6KGWHM" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="LPVCCKNZSVHIHERNWPHD6KGWHM"></div><p class="text | article-text">Hospital emergency rooms were jammed with the wounded. Rep. Ruben Kihuen, a Democrat whose congressional district includes part of Las Vegas, visited a hospital and said: "Literally, every single bed was being used, every single hallway was being used. Every single person there was trying to save a life."</p><p class="text | article-text">Las Vegas authorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a "family reunification center" for people to find loved ones.</p><p class="text | article-text">The dead included at least three off-duty police officers from various departments who were attending the concert, authorities said. Two on-duty officers were wounded, one critically, police said.</p><p class="text | article-text">"It's a devastating time," the sheriff said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div id="fusion-static-enter:ULJF3M3GDBD45AGYN23QB52DSU" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="ULJF3M3GDBD45AGYN23QB52DSU"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:ULJF3M3GDBD45AGYN23QB52DSU" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="ULJF3M3GDBD45AGYN23QB52DSU"></div><p class="text | article-text">In its claim of responsibility, the Islamic State group said the gunman was "a soldier" who had converted to Islam months ago. But it provided no evidence.</p><p class="text | article-text">And FBI agent Aaron Rouse said investigators had seen nothing so far to connect the attack to any international terror organization.</p><p class="text | article-text">The Islamic State has been known to make unsubstantiated claims of responsibility for attacks around the world.</p><p class="text | article-text">It previously said it was responsible for a June attack on a Manila casino and shopping complex where 37 died, mostly from smoke inhalation — a claim rejected by authorities, who said the lone attacker was a heavily indebted Filipino gambling addict.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The sheriff said authorities believe the Las Vegas bloodbath was a "lone wolf" attack but want to talk to Paddock's roommate, a woman Lombardo said was out of the country at the time of the attack.</p><p class="text | article-text">Lombardo said a check of federal and state databases showed the gunman was not on law enforcement authorities' radar before the bloodbath.</p><p class="text | article-text">Paddock lived in a retirement community, owned rental properties, held a private pilot's license and liked to travel to Las Vegas to play high-stakes video poker.</p><p class="text | article-text">As for why he went on the murderous rampage, his brother in Florida, Eric Paddock, told reporters: "I can't even make something up.
