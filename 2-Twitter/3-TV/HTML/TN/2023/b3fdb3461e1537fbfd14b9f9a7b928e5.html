He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.","longBio":"Jeremy Finley is the chief investigative reporter for WSMV4 Investigates. He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.\n\nJeremy’s investigations have resulted in multiple criminal charges and prison sentences, TBI and district attorney investigations, new state laws, the resignation of one of the highest paid elected officials in Nashville, a $1 million payout to the victims of a nationwide company scamming the sick and uninsured, and the discovery of missing girls.\n\nThe Nashville Scene wrote that Jeremy is “no stranger to blockbuster expose’s.” He was the first to expose the “unintended acceleration” in Toyota vehicles, which ultimately led to one of the largest recall of automobiles in the nation’s history and Congressional hearings in which his investigations were included.\n\nIt's his investigations into elected officials which prompted the Nashville Post to call him a watchdog for exposing corrupt politicians. After Jeremy exposed an elected official lounging in his bathrobe while claiming to be a meeting, the Nashville Scene called the story, “a devastatingly effective expose ... a piece that has already become part of Nashville's political folklore.”\n\nJeremy’s undercover work has repeatedly exposed thieves and scam artists in action, resulting in guilty pleas. In one notable case, he and a WSMV4 photojournalist found runaway girls hiding in the home of a man accused of squatting in a foreclosed home. The girls were then located by police and the man pleaded guilty to harboring runaways.\n\nJeremy is a three-time recipient of the IRE award, one of the highest honors in investigative journalism. He received the honors from Investigative Reporters and Editors for his stories exposing mistakes made by government agencies during the historic flood that swamped downtown Nashville, for his contributions to the WSMV4 investigations that exposed the corruption in former Judge Casey Moreland's courts, and for exposing imposter police officers in Middle Tennessee. He’s also been named as a finalist for the IRE award three times, received a national Emmy nomination for investigative reporting, received a national Edward R. Murrow award and a national Headliner award in 2018 for investigative reporting.\n\nHe’s also received twenty-five Emmys, six regional Edward R. Murrow awards, multiple first place honors from the Associated Press and the Best Public Service award from the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. He's been named the journalist of the year by the AP and was named the best large market TV reporter in Tennessee.\n\nJeremy is reminded daily what’s important in life thanks to the women who run his life: his wife Rebecca and their two daughters. He’s a voracious reader, cheers on the St. Louis Cardinals, has an unhealthy obsession with Jeep Wranglers and is a terrible runner who barely survived a few marathons.\n\nWhile he’s most proud of his investigations, he admits his favorite assignment was covering the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, for WSMV4 and the other stations owned by the Meredith Corporation.\n\nJeremy is also an internationally published novelist. His debut novel, \"The Darkest Time of Night,\" was called one of the best books of the summer by People magazine and the New York Post in 2018. His next book, \"The Dark Above,\" received rave reviews from NPR and the Library Journal. He is busy at work on his next novel.\n\nJeremy is a graduate of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (Go Salukis!). He has a Master's degree in public affairs reporting from the University of Illinois at Springfield, and was named to their Hall of Fame in 2024.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"investigative","last_updated_date":"2024-05-23T21:58:41.476Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:32:13.280Z","description":{"basic":"Dean,

James covered stories that garnered international interest from the death of Tyre Nichols to the abduction of Eliza Fletcher.\n\n\nWhile living in Memphis, James prided himself on being a voice for underprivileged communities and being a person, who residents could turn to in times of crisis or triumph. \n\n\nHe also was a member of the local National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) chapter. James became active in the community through various outreach initiatives, whether it was speaking at local schools or volunteering to clean up the city. \n\n\nPrior to that, James served as a reporter/ fill-in anchor in Southeast Texas. He covered stories ranging from hurricanes, presidential visits to an explosion at a local oil refinery.\n\n\nOne of the stories that stands out most to him was when he was able to document a father’s ‘fight’ to see his terminally ill daughter in the hospital, at the height of the pandemic. Through his reporting, the hospital changed its policy and allowed him to reunite with her before she died. \n\n\nWhile there, he received a local press club award and was also a part of the station’s coverage which won a statewide Emmy.\n\n\nJames, a Dallas native, graduated from the University of North Texas. As you can imagine, he is a huge Dallas sports fan. \n\n\nWhen he’s not cheering for his favorite teams or reporting, he’s typically spending time with family, traveling or attending church. \n\n\nHe is excited to call the Music City home and looks forward to connecting with viewers and seeing all that the city has to offer.

She was on the ground a whole week after 20 people were killed in Waverly’s deadly flash floods. She walked with protesters and the Tennessee Three lawmakers fighting to get their seat back in the State House. She also brought the latest live coverage of The Covenant School shooting that took six innocent lives. \n\nMarissa uncovered new developments when she spoke with a Tennessee State Representative’s secretary who worked for him when he was arrested by FBI agents. He was later charged with wire fraud, bribery, and kickbacks. \n\nBefore WSMV4, she was an MMJ, reporter, and fill-in anchor in the Quad Cities at WQAD in Moline, Illinois. There she covered “The Flood of 2019” and was on the ground after a barrier along the Mississippi River broke in downtown Davenport, Iowa. She talked with business owners and community members who lost everything to the waters.\n\nMarissa graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she received a B.S. in Advertising. She became the football reporter, and interviewed Head Coach Lovie Smith each week. She also helped anchor the University’s new morning show, “Good Morning Illini.”\n\nWhen not working on a story, Marissa is an avid runner and completed her third marathon in 2022. To compensate she also loves to cook, bake, and try Nashville restaurants.\n\nShe’s the biggest fan of country music born and raised in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nIf you have a story idea, send it to marissa.sulek@wsmv.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-10-20T21:54:06.151Z","role":"Reporter","custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"17"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:04:45.108Z","description":{"basic":"“I’ve seen people dive their cars around the barricades.

","longBio":"Dan Thomas has been a weather fanatic for as long as he can remember. As a small child, in his hometown of North Andover, MA, he loved to stare out the window, watching New England's powerful ocean storms. To this day, he still has a cassette recording from when he was 6 years old, on which he said, \"It's rainy, snowy, windy ... That's all the news for now. This is Danny Thomas.\"\nNeedless to say, he's living out his dream.\nDan's passion for weather led him to The Pennsylvania State University, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in meteorology. While at Penn State, he worked as a part-time, on-air meteorologist for WPSX-TV. He also joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps and was commissioned as a lieutenant upon graduation.\nAfter graduate school, Dan began his military career at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, GA. He deployed to the Middle East, where he briefed pilots on weather conditions for their training missions over Iraq's no-fly zone. He completed his active duty military service in the fall of 2000 as a captain, leading a 15-person organization in weather operations at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, OK.\nAfter his time in the military, Dan began his full-time career in television as the morning meteorologist for KHBS/KHOG-TV in Fort Smith/Fayetteville, AR. For the following two years, he chased and tracked severe thunderstorms all across western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.\nFrom tornado alley, Dan moved to \"hurricane central\" - New Orleans - in early 2003 to work as a broadcast meteorologist for WDSU-TV, the NBC affiliate. While there, he covered more than a half dozen hurricanes and tropical storms that hit the southeastern United States. His coverage of Hurricane Frances in 2004 earned him \"First Place for Breaking Weather\" from the Louisiana Associated Press.\nMost notable was Dan's coverage leading up to and during Hurricane Katrina. Dan warned viewers of the impending devastation during the final hours of preparation and the first hours of impact. He rode out the storm on the 11th floor of the Hilton Hotel in New Orleans. Dan recalls the room began creaking eight hours before landfall. The hotel beds began shaking two hours before landfall, due to the increasing wind. It was at that point that Dan and several coworkers evacuated to the hotel lobby for safety. The following day, as flood waters rose and crime escalated, Dan and his remaining coworkers evacuated to a sister station in Orlando, FL, where they remained for the following two months.\nDan moved to Nashville and joined the WSMV team in August 2006. In May 2009, Dan was certified by the American Meteorological Society as a Certified Broadcast Meteorologist, which involves passing very rigorous testing and standards. He joins First Alert Meteorologist Lisa Spencer as a recipient of this certification. WSMV is the only television station in Nashville with two CBMs.\nDan's thrilled to call this area home with its gorgeous terrain, ever-changing weather, and very kind people. When not in the office, Dan loves spending time with his wife and two children.  He says coaching his son’s baseball and basketball teams and watching his daughter’s horseback riding lessons and basketball games are among his favorite things to do.  He doesn’t take a moment of quality time spent with his family for granted.  During his \"me-time\", he likes to go running, lift weights, play tennis, golf, and even tend to his many flowers and palm trees (that's right…palm trees, even in Middle Tennessee)!\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:49:12.180Z","author_type":"Meteorologist

She was on the ground a whole week after 20 people were killed in Waverly’s deadly flash floods. She walked with protesters and the Tennessee Three lawmakers fighting to get their seat back in the State House. She also brought the latest live coverage of The Covenant School shooting that took six innocent lives. \n\nMarissa uncovered new developments when she spoke with a Tennessee State Representative’s secretary who worked for him when he was arrested by FBI agents. He was later charged with wire fraud, bribery, and kickbacks. \n\nBefore WSMV4, she was an MMJ, reporter, and fill-in anchor in the Quad Cities at WQAD in Moline, Illinois. There she covered “The Flood of 2019” and was on the ground after a barrier along the Mississippi River broke in downtown Davenport, Iowa. She talked with business owners and community members who lost everything to the waters.\n\nMarissa graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she received a B.S. in Advertising. She became the football reporter, and interviewed Head Coach Lovie Smith each week. She also helped anchor the University’s new morning show, “Good Morning Illini.”\n\nWhen not working on a story, Marissa is an avid runner and completed her third marathon in 2022. To compensate she also loves to cook, bake, and try Nashville restaurants.\n\nShe’s the biggest fan of country music born and raised in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nIf you have a story idea, send it to
