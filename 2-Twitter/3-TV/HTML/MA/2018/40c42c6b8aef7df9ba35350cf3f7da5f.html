She grew up in southern New Jersey and saw a few big storms that scared her to death.\n\nJanna's father told her how in the Midwest the sky would turn green before tornadoes developed-this sparked curiosity that would develop into a passion by the time she was a teenager.\n\nJanna was researching colleges before her first day of high school and decided on Lyndon State in northern Vermont. There, her passion for severe weather and storm chasing shifted and she became interested in television and broadcasting weather to the public.\n\nNot long after graduating with a degree in meteorology, she took her first job as a freelancer for News 12 Traffic and Weather in Woodbury, NY. For four years she freelanced for the morning and evening weathercasts for five television stations across the New York City metro area.\n\nJanna took her first full time job back in 2010 as the morning meteorologist for WVVA-TV in Bluefield, WV, where she would go on to work for six years and served as their chief meteorologist for four of those years.\n\nThe craziest weather she's seen and forecasted includes a tornado in Brooklyn, NY, Hurricane Sandy which socked WV with heavy snow, the 2012 derecho, and the 2016 flood that devastated parts of southern West Virginia.\n\nJanna is so happy to be back in New England and working for Western Mass News! She brings her Philly sports pride with her, along with her three cats and two dog, or 'traveling zoo'. You can usually find her at a game with her husband or watching football, hockey or baseball, playing golf, taking pictures, or playing with the pup at the dog park!","slug":"","instagram":"metjannabrown","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2022-09-25T01:02:05.983Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wggb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T02:04:26.346Z","description":{"basic":"Overnight

As a Springfield native who experienced the severe weather event firsthand, Liam's love for science was kickstarted.\n\nA couple of years after the tornado, Liam attended space camp in Huntsville, AL where he got hands-on experience flying simulators and conducting experiments.  For a while, he wanted to be an astronaut or forecast weather for NASA and his love for space still exists to this day. \n\nWhen he's not studying the stars, Liam also enjoys the great outdoors and all that Mother Nature has to offer.  He was a part of the Boy Scouts of America, Western Mass Council for about a decade.  During his time there, he achieved the rank of Eagle and temporarily worked as an Archery instructor at the Moses Scout Reservation is Russell.\n\nLiam attended Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, CT and graduated with his degree in meteorology in 2021.  During his time in college, Liam attended the American Meteorological society's annual conference, where he got to learn about researching weather phenomena, forecasting for the National Weather Service, and TV broadcasting. \n\nUpon graduation,  Liam was hired at Western Mass News as a news producer.  In June 2022, Liam made his meteorological debut on the networks of Western Mass News.  He has since transitioned into a hybrid role of producing and filling in on the weather desk on weekends.\n\nOutside of work, Liam enjoys spending time with his family and friends right here in western Massachusetts.  His favorite activities include hiking, swimming, and sipping on an ice-cold can of Coke.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2022-09-25T01:01:34.276Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/LiamMurphyWX","twitter":"https://twitter.com/liammurphywx","custom_gray_stationname":"wggb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4"}}},{"_id":"taylor-smith","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Taylor Smith","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/a4db59a8-0f1b-4b09-a055-ede774845b08.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Taylor Smith is a content producer and multimedia journalist for Western Mass News.","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"taylor.smith@westernmassnews.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"taylor.smith@westernmassnews.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"taylor-smith","firstName":"Taylor","lastName":"Smith","byline":"Taylor Smith","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/a4db59a8-0f1b-4b09-a055-ede774845b08.jpg","email":"taylor.smith@westernmassnews.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"Taylor Smith is a content producer and multimedia journalist for Western Mass News.","longBio":"Taylor Smith is a content producer and multimedia journalist for Western Mass News.
