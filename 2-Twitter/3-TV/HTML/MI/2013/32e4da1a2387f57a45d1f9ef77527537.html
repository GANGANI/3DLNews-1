<p><img border="0" height="213" src="http://snowkentucky.com/hopkins.jpg" width="320" /><div class="separator">

 <br /> In an article from <a href="http://wnem.com/">wnem.com</a>, when a school volunteer asked if she could open carry a handgun at the school, the school was put into &quot;Modified Lockdown&quot;.&nbsp; The article does not say that she was openly carrying a handgun or if she was carrying concealed, either of which were likely legal (depending on the intricacies of Michigan law) only that she <b>asked</b> that the school allow her to do so.&nbsp; The video with the story claims that she had a loaded handgun.&nbsp; The article and the video are vague enough that she might have had a gun in her car, she might have been carrying concealed, she might have been openly carrying,&nbsp; she might have been asked if she had a gun, or the school authorities might have assumed that she had a gun.&nbsp; From the article:<br />
 <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Millington Schools Superintendent John Males tells WNEM.com that a woman who is a volunteer with the district went to Kirk Early Elementary and asked to open carry a handgun in the school.</i></blockquote> It is what happened next that is truly astounding.&nbsp; The school was put into &quot;modified lockdown&quot; until the County Prosecutor had determined that the woman was off of school property! &nbsp; Consider.&nbsp; School was disrupted simply because a woman asked some authority figure at a school if they could openly carry a handgun there. &nbsp; The woman is legally allowed to carry with her Michigan Concealed Pistol License (CPL). &nbsp; Then, the authorities at the school, obsessed with the thought crime of carrying a gun in a school (unless it is by a government sanctioned authority figure) put the school in &quot;Modified Lockdown&quot;. &nbsp; Apparently they are not able to determine if the threat of a person who asked a question has left school property themselves. &nbsp; They only allow school to resume when the County Prosecutor determines that the person who <b>asked a question</b>, is not on school property.&nbsp;&nbsp; A poster on <a href="http://opencarry.org/">opencarry.org</a> claims that they know the woman in question, and that the wnem.com story is full of inaccuracies.&nbsp; It is a short story.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we can only speculate as to what the inaccuracies might be.&nbsp; <br />
 <br /> Unless there is more to the story, such as a history of mental problems, or threats, in which case one would ask why the woman is allowed to be a volunteer for the school, this is so bizarre as to be something&nbsp; out of Kafka.&nbsp; The woman likely knew that she was not doing anything illegal, immoral or fattening, and was simply asking as a courtesy to the school authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; People with concealed carry permits tend to be extremely polite.&nbsp; I know this from having taught concealed carry permit classes in Arizona for over 15 years.<br />
 <br /> I can understand the school authorities saying &quot;no, we do not want you openly carrying in the school&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureaucrats tend to be timid creatures when it comes to the potential for public controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But put the school on &quot;Modified Lockdown&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder if that is anything like&nbsp; &quot;Double Secret Probation&quot;.<br />
 <br /> From the article, the school authorities are not releasing any more information.<br />
 <br /> A <a href="http://www.wnem.com/story/24233555/schools-go-into-lockdown-after-volunteer-asks-to-open-carry-handgun">poll at the article</a> has the question:<br />
 <br /> Do you think law-abiding citizens should be allowed to openly carry handguns in schools?<br />
 <br /> 79% if the respondents answered &quot;Yes&quot;.<br />
