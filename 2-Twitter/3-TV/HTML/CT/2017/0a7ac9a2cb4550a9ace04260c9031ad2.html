Now, former President Trump has finished speaking. Let's check in with news twelve's Dan. Serafin Dan has been right in the mix. Heather, you saw her outside the rally. Dan has been inside right in the mix of things. So Dan, can you tell us, what else did you hear from people who were supporters of Trump as well as from Trump himself, those Trump supporters and everybody here in attendance very jovial throughout the day. As we said earlier today, it was an atmosphere that involved a lot of singing and dancing as people waited to come inside that continued even up to the former president's comments that just finished up. Former President Trump speaking here in the Bronx for a little more than an hour, probably closer to 90 minutes long. Talking about a lot of different topics ranging from him growing up here in New York City and having some success in the business world in New York City. Really a lot of his dealings throughout New York City. Trump spoke a lot about his personal history and how it relates to the five boroughs and obviously moving on into more political subjects. Obviously, all of it got the crowd here fired up. They seem to be right in line and cheering, applauding throughout the speech whenever Trump would make a statement that would elicit obviously applause or cheering that happened from the probably thousands of supporters here in the Bronx. Listening to that speech, Trump spoke about some of the issues that are facing New Yorkers and even here in the Bronx spoke about a lot of the New York City politicians and their Democratic Party allegiances. Trump said he wants to work with them if he is president to try to help New York City in its future. But noel a jovial atmosphere throughout the day, we saw more of that during Trump's again, almost 90 minutes of talking here that just wrapped up. Now, as Heather Fordham told those supporters now by making their way out of here, you hear the music that jovial atmosphere is continuing. But for now that's the latest. We're in Crotona Park, Dan Serafin News 12, the Bronx.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec/cddb8dd5-f7de-4a8a-9458-12c56634b9ec.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"2AbGqOJuEsF9Pf2u2CAFmA","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-24T02:27:27.460Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T02:29:19.926Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"serafintrump10_2024-05-23-22-27-07","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"7rLw8m364vqUhqMysmkJyi","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-24T02:27:26.826Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T02:27:26.826Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"serafintrump10_2024-05-23-22-27-07","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/7rLw8m364vqUhqMysmkJyi/cafafe70d704f1a3881eaed07cbbd661/d358847d-a748-4398-a9da-7851882535d0.jpg","details":{"size":194716,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"d358847d-a748-4398-a9da-7851882535d0.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"serafintrump10_2024-05-23-22-27-07.mxf","duration":72,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"3ffd654577489777cc7f1885c29af9fc","size":260638139,"source":"uploads/news12/serafintrump10_2024-05-23-22-27-07","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.mp4","size":114160296,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"424aa3a12b402f081a88e9916eed38ef","duration":71404},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89_854x480.mp4","size":23409812,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"943869de7011d01aea92894c16b06bb4","duration":71404},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.mp3","size":1141864,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"6ef0ff3bf7efa4fee621da536d6c6cb9","duration":71404},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.0000000.jpg","size":289970,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"fa5fb92c78ad4577971ed4f64a4aa9c7","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89_1024x576.mp4","size":113822688,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"aa6fb481625dc9bea544ec1f73a23b9d","duration":71404},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89/4ec30be4-a207-41b5-a803-a4c40a5b3c89.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_05fc5d65-a312-4660-aaf5-931d03986cef","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"News.

Not everyone has been in support. There were also counter protests happening. So we do wanna check in with News Twelve's Heather Fordham, seeing how things are going where she is at. Heather. It has been a long night. You have been outside near the folks who were lining up to get into the rally as well. Tell me where you are now and what's happening, you know, a long night. Indeed, we are back outside the entrance to where Trump actually just wrapped up. There is a lot of people now making their way out. There's also a heightened police presence. A lot more officers out here than we saw earlier for the most part right now, things are still calm, which is a good thing. Now, just about a half mile outside of the park, there was a counter rally from people in opposition of Trump. We also stopped by there. It was organized by assembly member, Amanda Seal and a handful of other local elected officials as well as the Labors International Union of North America. 79 the New York Nurses Association and many other organizations were in attendance. Now, their message today is that despite the thousands of people who have turned up tonight at the park, Trump is not welcome here. And they say he does not stand for the values that represent the Bronx Bronx for President Vanessa Gibson. Also in attendance. She spoke to us about why she came out tonight today when he goes back home and he goes back to Manhattan Criminal Court. We still have work to do. We still have to create more jobs, low hour unemployment. We have to get ready for the summer when it comes to summer youth and so many of our youth oriented programs since kids will be out of school in a month, we have to get back to work and at the end of the day, this is a distraction. It's a distraction from what matters from what's important to us and from our democratic values. And right now there is actually a ton of people filing out from the gates from that rally as it has just wrapped up.

Thousands of people packed into Crotona Park, but many stayed outside the gates to be part of today's historic rally news. Twelve's Heather Fordham spoke with those rallying in support and against the former president. Yeah, I love you a vote for Donald Trump. Thousands of people filled for Tona Park to be a part of history in the South Bronx. This is gonna go down in history. I get goosebumps people that came out this kid, this older people. This is uh this is something that you could talk to like 30 40 50 years from now. I was here this day. You know, in the Bronx supporting Trump, each person with their own reason to support the former president. New York City has an influx of a lot of illegal immigrants right now and you know, it's killing a lot of jobs, good paying union jobs for citizens who pay taxes. And Trump is the only one talking about that. So I'm supporting him just outside the park. Trump's opposers also rallied organized by assembly member, Amanda Septimo. We're really proud that the community that organizations have turned out because it sends a message that the Bronx is truly rejecting Donald Trump among their crowd. The Bronx borough president, local leaders and members of different labor unions, all with their reasons to rally. I came here because you know Trump should not win this election. And labor has to stand behind Joe Biden because he is the best president we've ever had in generations on the issues of labor in Crotona Park, Heather Fordham News 12, the Bronx.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611/ccf0d6a7-f5b6-41b1-bbab-b23d33a1b611.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"News 12's Brittany Cadet ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://bronx.news12.com/supporters-opposers-discuss-former-president-trumps-campaign-rally-at-crotona-park-in-the-bronx"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"spoke with people in the crowd","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" at Crotona Park.

As I said, we had Heather outside talking to opposition and supporters, Dan inside talking to supporters as well as Britney. Now, she has had a chance to speak to a lot of different people. Britney. I mentioned how you spoke to someone who traveled across the world and ended up at this rally. What else have you been learning out there? And what are you hearing from people? We've been learning a lot out here. Like you said, I've spoken to someone who came all the way from France and he said it was his lifelong dream to see President Donald Trump speak here, just speak in front of him. And it just so happened that during his trip, there was a rally right here in Crotona Park in New York City. Now, the energy is still very high as dozens and hundreds just listened to former president here at the park and dozens of them that this is kind of their life long dream. Like that's something that I've just been hearing all night. And many of them also tell me that they camped out and some of them just say that they're excited that a former president is here in the Bronx so that they can show them what the Bronx is all about. Now, we also spoke to a veteran who tells us that he says that he wanted to come to this rally today to make it known that the Bronx is not what it seems. I'm a veteran. I'm here to fight.

Long Island is known to have some of the best beaches here. But what makes Cedar Beach to you the best beach? Everything about it is that some of all its parts, right. Uh, they're safe because we have one of the best lifeguards, uh, teams here in the, uh, on Long Island. Uh, we have this place, uh, uh, so we have the, uh, the bay on the other side and we are also home to one of the best 911 memorials in the northeast.

Hey, Alex. Hey, good morning, Erin. You know, I love my plants because it aligns so well with my passion and career as a meteorologist, plants usually tell you what the climate is like. But I swear we are not in Florida. We are surrounded by palm trees though and it is all because of company called go palm trees. It really does bring the tropical look. But how did these palm trees get here? I'm here with Ollie and George, who are the owners? Well, uh we got a farm down in homestead, we got 20 acres and then um we ship them up, we track the trailers and then we bring the vibes right here uh to Long Island. So this is a pretty cool concept, right? Obviously, these palm trees aren't going to survive the winter here. But I know you've kind of compared it to Christmas trees because on the farm you're growing next year's palm trees in the year's palm trees after that and then you bring them back up. How could this all get started? George? Uh So in 2020 we saw that there was a need for trees, more trees on Long Island. Um There with COVID and everything happening, people spend a lot more time in their backyards and it was just a, a real easy way to turn their backyard into their own tropical paradise. Um, Christmas palms grow at a really quick rate and you can pretty much turn them over within two years. That's amazing. Yeah, just two years to get a palm tree. V is the beauty of having a farm in Florida. Right. You guys are a long island face company with such a passion for plants. I mean, look at all the different types of palm trees.

this morning we're continuing our best beaches summer series every Thursday, we will be at a different great Long Island beach. And today our Gen Selig and Alex Calamia are at Cedar Beach in Babylon. What's going on on over there, Jed? I hear you're having a lot of fun. Yeah, in my head, I already made plans. I'm coming back here this weekend. It's such a fun vibe here at the Salt Sha. And with me, I have Billy and Mark, the owner and the manager here at Salt and boy, what a it is to be here. It's great. Right. It's awesome. What's the best part about being here in the summer time right there. The view of the ocean. You got the ocean on one side, you have the bay on the other side. Um, it's just that we try to give everybody a two hour vacation, live music, great food, palm trees and something for everybody. I know volleyball, food, obviously drinks the playground, the band. Yeah, the volleyball is amazing. There's actually, excuse me, there's 70 volleyball courts out here. So from Monday to Thursday, local people come literally 2000 and they play from 6 to 8 o'clock. So we hope to get them before and then we get them after here at the soul shack. We have live music seven days a week and there's never a cover charge. After four o'clock, the parking is absolutely free. It's just a real relaxing. If you live on Long Island, we work, we work as hard as we do. I mean, this is what we work hard for right here. And if you're a nineties baby or if you're not a 90 baby and you like good music, you want to check them out tomorrow because they're the nine, the nine band is one of the best, if not the best. And then this weekend on Saturday we have Disco Unlimited and that is just really fun. The dance floor will be packed and then Sunday we have the burn unit, Billy Marzel. He's a local guy here. So, yeah, there's always something happening at the Salt Shack. So we're going to hang out all weekend long. I'm gonna send it back to you guys in the studio now. It's very much a nineties kid. That sounds great to me, Jen. Thanks so much. We will check back in a little bit to have the live.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774/11360ee7-a561-4e1a-938e-c52bf2b19774.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Chief Deputy Lifeguard Dan Bachety talks about safety precautions in place at the beach:","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" ","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"38rILf78KS7lGJBGk7radC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-30T12:11:04.018Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-30T12:13:34.488Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"LIlifeguare8530_2024-05-30-08-10-46","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"16dcZOMrscrZc1plNAzbGp","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-30T12:11:03.443Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-30T12:11:03.443Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"LIlifeguare8530_2024-05-30-08-10-46","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/16dcZOMrscrZc1plNAzbGp/87e26fb3f3c1dfe77cdc6c03fb18e427/8d3413bf-d281-4c82-852f-7bb17aa2ed18.jpg","details":{"size":340519,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"8d3413bf-d281-4c82-852f-7bb17aa2ed18.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"LIlifeguare8530_2024-05-30-08-10-46.mxf","duration":117,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"80390fc39407162341f9a90798653544","size":434616690,"source":"uploads/news12/LIlifeguare8530_2024-05-30-08-10-46","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.mp4","size":185955593,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"1c91bd175549fc7980c8fdaf4e24df5c","duration":116483},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6_854x480.mp4","size":38163379,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"ad06271affd35bdec35d44ac4b52d831","duration":116483},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.mp3","size":1863262,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"5bd7c174e80d1cf3ff14b7d91459d246","duration":116483},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.0000000.jpg","size":194329,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"cce80e013b4b7c9548f128122a40ddcd","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6_1024x576.mp4","size":185631018,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"1aaf6d7aa95de81530a7aaa908a56dcc","duration":116483},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_53e639e9-2d7b-4bc3-b0f0-5c978973f971","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"Every Thursday. We're highlighting some of the amazing beaches here on Long Island throughout the summer. That's right. This morning, we're continuing our best beaches series at Cedar Beach in Babylon. One of my favorites, news travels, Jen Selig is there now showing us everything we can look forward to this summer. Hey, Jen. Hey Aaron, one of my favorites too. I'm with Dan Bay. You are the assistant chief lifeguard here at Cedar Beach and Lifeguards are good. We are good. We're very excited about this year. As you can see the beach is beautiful. There's plenty of things to do. Uh We're having so much fun and we just wanna make sure everybody's safe throughout the uh the summer months. Fun is obviously number one thing, but safety is the top priority. So you guys are all geared up. You're ready to go when Long Islanders come for the weekend. Correct. We have everybody set and ready to go. The lifeguards are all training and at all the time and we're to go to have a good time and make everybody feel safe when they come to the beach. You have a really cool job. I mean, you get to spend a lot of your time out on the sand. What would you say? Your favorite part is about being here. My favorite part is obviously being in the water. We have so much fun between surfing and, you know, skim boarding, body surfing. We have so much fun that, uh, I've been doing it for over 40 years and as long as my body holds out, I'll continue to do it. Is there anything you want to just advise Long Islanders when they make their way here to the beach? What they should be mindful of? Yes, to just make sure that you stay in the areas where the lifeguards are between the flags and, uh, just pay attention to all the rules and look for the rip currents and make sure everybody is safe and having fun. All right. So we're expecting to see crowds during the summertime right on the weekend. Oh, the crowds have been great already. We had a great Memorial Day weekend and we're looking forward to more. All right, we're gonna have fun here at Cedar Beach and send it back to you guys in the studio. Looks like you're already having fun, Chen. Thanks so much. We'll check back in a bit.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6/745082de-f433-40d7-842f-b26a310ef1f6.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Do you have a favorite Long Island beach?

It was, yeah, it was refreshing and it's just perfect this afternoon and more perfect weather is coming up for your Friday. You can see the flag blowing around a little bit. We've had, um, a northerly wind that brought in the slightly cooler temperatures for the day today and the nice sky conditions around the east end, you've only been in the upper fifties and low sixties. So it is a change, but it's nice. Now, tomorrow will be seasonable. So we're a couple of degrees warmer in the afternoon. We've got a great start for you in the morning at 6 a.m. temps in the fifties to near 60 comfortable at 2 p.m. about 74 to 75 degrees. It will be clear through the day. It will be absolutely fantastic. What a great way to kick off the weekend. If you have the day off overnight, any clouds are moving out, we have a sunny start to your Friday at 7 a.m. 59 in Rocky 0.59 in Medford. Might want a sweatshirt when you head out early, um, with a little bit of a breeze out of the north, but the afternoon will be quiet. Fantastic. A couple of fair day clouds looking great island wide tomorrow night into Saturday, it's still clear. So Saturday's another amazing day. We'll start to warm up. That summer feel is coming back in the morning on Saturday, temperatures are in the sixties and in the afternoon we see some of those eighties pop up, especially from Glen Cove at 8382 in Smithtown at 430 Bridgehampton to Montauk. Temperatures in the low seventies. Just a fantastic start to the weekend for you. After that, we'll start to see a couple of clouds come in late Sunday. So tonight and tomorrow night will be clear if you want to see Saturn right next to the half moon, it's going to be a beautiful sight in the southeast sky. You can look early tomorrow morning. So after about 3 to 4 a.m. look to the southeast, you'll be able to see it nice and clear and that will last up until about sunrise. So tonight it's mostly clear and cool at 54 north wind, good visibility. We're in the seventies tomorrow. It's just a pleasant seasonable day around Long Island. Nice weekend. Coming up Sunday night, we will track a couple of showers clearing by Monday. The start of next week will be sunny with highs in the mid seventies.

We've had, um, a northerly wind that brought in the slightly cooler temperatures for the day today and the nice sky conditions around the east end, you've only been in the upper fifties and low sixties. So it is a change, but it's nice. Now, tomorrow will be seasonable. So we're a couple of degrees warmer in the afternoon. We've got a great start for you in the morning at 6 a.m. temps in the fifties to near 60 comfortable at 2 p.m. about 74 to 75 degrees. It will be clear through the day. It will be absolutely fantastic. What a great way to kick off the weekend. If you have the day off overnight, any clouds are moving out, we have a sunny start to your Friday at 7 a.m. 59 in Rocky 0.59 in Medford. Might want a sweatshirt when you head out early, um, with a little bit of a breeze out of the north, but the afternoon will be quiet. Fantastic. A couple of fair day clouds looking great island wide tomorrow night into Saturday, it's still clear. So Saturday's another amazing day. We'll start to warm up. That summer feel is coming back in the morning on Saturday, temperatures are in the sixties and in the afternoon we see some of those eighties pop up, especially from Glen Cove at 8382 in Smithtown at 430 Bridgehampton to Montauk. Temperatures in the low seventies. Just a fantastic start to the weekend for you. After that, we'll start to see a couple of clouds come in late Sunday. So tonight and tomorrow night will be clear if you want to see Saturn right next to the half moon, it's going to be a beautiful sight in the southeast sky. You can look early tomorrow morning. So after about 3 to 4 a.m. look to the southeast, you'll be able to see it nice and clear and that will last up until about sunrise. So tonight it's mostly clear and cool at 54 north wind, good visibility. We're in the seventies tomorrow. It's just a pleasant seasonable day around Long Island. Nice weekend. Coming up Sunday night, we will track a couple of showers clearing by Monday. The start of next week will be sunny with highs in the mid seventies. All right.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mov","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}},"thumbnail":"//images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/4yk0WZi5cDcIbK0tWJmxMt/3616da9a11473b80b8439f307678d733/3__56_.png?fm=webp","description":"News 12 Storm Watch Meteorologist Sam Augeri says showers and storms overnight and early Thursday are ahead before a warm and sunny Friday.","categories":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"3r0YOPtgBUFo9J7Y4MApOS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-02-02T00:54:16.466Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-15T03:09:46.188Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"weather stories"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"2O6hrjhTGedQJFGyp1aWUg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-10-10T14:24:51.844Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-26T21:04:12.840Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Data_Weather Forecast"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"3avrF6POtflX6MQpXj1krw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-10-10T14:25:01.879Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-26T21:04:25.014Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Data_Active Weather"}}],"withAds":true,"content":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"News 12 Storm Watch Meteorologist Sam Augeri says showers and storms overnight and early Thursday are ahead before a warm and sunny Friday.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"3ODho7TQIDvQE0yzuy66rG","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-29T22:07:23.160Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-29T22:07:23.160Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"3 (56)","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/3ODho7TQIDvQE0yzuy66rG/50a3033eb11d0214c919319fa28342c1/3__56_.png","details":{"size":2153265,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"3 (56).png","contentType":"image/png"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"HEADLINES:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Expect some showers and a rumble of thunder overnight into Thursday morning.

All right.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mov","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87/7f18f45f-78fa-4409-a09a-7bb369e71d87.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}},"thumbnail":"//images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/6XnAji2KzIvhLWv3raEJiF/fa6abc43e3925ad1398df47ea0a3aa85/5__29_.png?fm=webp","description":"News 12 Storm Watch Meteorologist Sam Augeri says rain is coming Wednesday evening into early Thursday before warm sunshine for Friday and the weekend.","categories":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"3r0YOPtgBUFo9J7Y4MApOS","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-02-02T00:54:16.466Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-15T03:09:46.188Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"weather stories"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"2O6hrjhTGedQJFGyp1aWUg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-10-10T14:24:51.844Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-26T21:04:12.840Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Data_Weather Forecast"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"3avrF6POtflX6MQpXj1krw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2023-10-10T14:25:01.879Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-26T21:04:25.014Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Data_Active Weather"}}],"withAds":true,"content":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"News 12 Storm Watch Meteorologist Sam Augeri says rain is coming Wednesday evening into early Thursday before warm sunshine for Friday and the weekend.

now. And wow, can we just keep the weather like this forever? So nice. And today it was almost chilly this morning. Right? It was, yeah, it was refreshing and it's just perfect this afternoon and more perfect weather is coming up for your Friday. You can see the flag blowing around a little bit. We've had, um, a northerly wind that brought in the slightly cooler temperatures for the day today and the nice sky conditions around the east end, you've only been in the upper fifties and low sixties. So it is a change, but it's nice. Now, tomorrow will be seasonable. So we're a couple of degrees warmer in the afternoon. We've got a great start for you in the morning at 6 a.m. temps in the fifties to near 60 comfortable at 2 p.m. about 74 to 75 degrees. It will be clear through the day. It will be absolutely fantastic. What a great way to kick off the weekend. If you have the day off overnight, any clouds are moving out, we have a sunny start to your Friday at 7 a.m. 59 in Rocky 0.59 in Medford. Might want a sweatshirt when you head out early, um, with a little bit of a breeze out of the north, but the afternoon will be quiet. Fantastic. A couple of fair day clouds looking great island wide tomorrow night into Saturday, it's still clear. So Saturday's another amazing day. We'll start to warm up. That summer feel is coming back in the morning on Saturday, temperatures are in the sixties and in the afternoon we see some of those eighties pop up, especially from Glen Cove at 8382 in Smithtown at 430 Bridgehampton to Montauk. Temperatures in the low seventies. Just a fantastic start to the weekend for you. After that, we'll start to see a couple of clouds come in late Sunday. So tonight and tomorrow night will be clear if you want to see Saturn right next to the half moon, it's going to be a beautiful sight in the southeast sky. You can look early tomorrow morning. So after about 3 to 4 a.m. look to the southeast, you'll be able to see it nice and clear and that will last up until about sunrise. So tonight it's mostly clear and cool at 54 north wind, good visibility. We're in the seventies tomorrow. It's just a pleasant seasonable day around Long Island. Nice weekend. Coming up Sunday night, we will track a couple of showers clearing by Monday. The start of next week will be sunny with highs in the mid seventies.

And wow, can we just keep the weather like this forever? So nice. And today it was almost chilly this morning. Right? It was, yeah, it was refreshing and it's just perfect this afternoon and more perfect weather is coming up for your Friday. You can see the flag blowing around a little bit. We've had, um, a northerly wind that brought in the slightly cooler temperatures for the day today and the nice sky conditions around the east end, you've only been in the upper fifties and low sixties. So it is a change, but it's nice. Now, tomorrow will be seasonable. So we're a couple of degrees warmer in the afternoon. We've got a great start for you in the morning at 6 a.m. temps in the fifties to near 60 comfortable at 2 p.m. about 74 to 75 degrees. It will be clear through the day. It will be absolutely fantastic. What a great way to kick off the weekend. If you have the day off overnight, any clouds are moving out, we have a sunny start to your Friday at 7 a.m. 59 in Rocky 0.59 in Medford. Might want a sweatshirt when you head out early, um, with a little bit of a breeze out of the north, but the afternoon will be quiet. Fantastic. A couple of fair day clouds looking great island wide tomorrow night into Saturday, it's still clear. So Saturday's another amazing day. We'll start to warm up. That summer feel is coming back in the morning on Saturday, temperatures are in the sixties and in the afternoon we see some of those eighties pop up, especially from Glen Cove at 8382 in Smithtown at 430 Bridgehampton to Montauk. Temperatures in the low seventies. Just a fantastic start to the weekend for you. After that, we'll start to see a couple of clouds come in late Sunday. So tonight and tomorrow night will be clear if you want to see Saturn right next to the half moon, it's going to be a beautiful sight in the southeast sky. You can look early tomorrow morning. So after about 3 to 4 a.m. look to the southeast, you'll be able to see it nice and clear and that will last up until about sunrise. So tonight it's mostly clear and cool at 54 north wind, good visibility. We're in the seventies tomorrow. It's just a pleasant seasonable day around Long Island. Nice weekend. Coming up Sunday night, we will track a couple of showers clearing by Monday. The start of next week will be sunny with highs in the mid seventies.
