we want to turn things back over this morning to meteorologist Matt hammer out with quite a stunning scene, important messages today, not only about the forecast but about the upcoming weekend and the mentality we need to get into on the water. Matt. Yeah, this can be all about fun, right. But you have to make sure you are preparing for this type of thing when you want to head out on the water and you want to take the boat out and you want to have a lot of fun. You have to do so safely. So joining me right now is Walter Goschen and Chuck Bryant from Sito Central Hudson. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Now, touch on a little bit. Walter, what is so important about making sure that you're taking these proper steps to make sure you have a fun day on the water. Well, honestly, after a long winter break, all of us want to get out there and sort of jump and grab the towels and run out to the boat. But you know, the boat is, well, you got to look under the hood before you go So just one of the things is for the spring commissioning is to make sure the boats ready to go and that you're ready to go with it. And Chuck, what are some things that you typically see boaters here along the Hudson River get themselves into in terms of needing assistance from, say, a company like Sito Sure, it's not unlike what you find on the road. It could be mechanical issues most common, it's probably out of fuel. So that's an easy one. We can run out and deliver fuel, any other issues. Simple battery issues like Walter said, uh you know, it's kind of blowing the dust off after the winter season and we have a lot of fun planned for this morning. We'll talk about some stuff on land and prep and how to prep the boat. But we'll also get out on the Hudson river a little bit later on too and talk about what sit to does if you need assistance and how to make sure you avoid any potential as we go throughout this boating season, 85 million Americans heading out on the water for, for this boating season. And uh yeah, a lot of them here across the Hudson Valley as well. So we have a lot of fun planned for that this morning. Here's a look at our weather for the rest of the day as well. A really great day shaping up all throughout the Hudson Valley. We have temperatures that will hit the eighties this afternoon, lower humidity. It will look great. It will feel nice as well. Shorts and short sleeves type weather for sure. Through the rest of today. And here's a look at that future cast taking you through the afternoon. Today, we go from the sixties and seventies this morning into the eighties this afternoon with a mostly clear to partly cloudy sky. Now into Memorial Day weekend, a nice day overall. On Saturday, late day shower can't be ruled out much more on that coming up in the full 10 day forecast in just a little bit.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb/ef910f51-9cab-454e-ba45-41533d4090eb.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"Visual aids demonstrate crucial safety procedures for boaters.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"13sdpskE0ogMnYtbQiEMOo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-24T10:05:57.618Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T10:09:40.267Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"524WCmatt530_2024-05-24-06-05-36","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"7FVauy6Cx3KmWH4e8V7ndC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-24T10:05:55.411Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T10:05:55.411Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"524WCmatt530_2024-05-24-06-05-36","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/7FVauy6Cx3KmWH4e8V7ndC/7065f89481807485a8dfd2a5a9d4fa59/2a4d22d7-29f7-4ab4-8e7b-c436534310c4.jpg","details":{"size":305065,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"2a4d22d7-29f7-4ab4-8e7b-c436534310c4.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"524WCmatt530_2024-05-24-06-05-36.mxf","duration":185,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"ea79e55ef64eb1514d85fe7821d88864","size":690502175,"source":"uploads/news12/524WCmatt530_2024-05-24-06-05-36","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.mp4","size":293779451,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"09a55984db1ea34683737dfe0bb65f0c","duration":184884},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05_854x480.mp4","size":60343318,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"ca2e2287af121697a80a0b5bdad95084","duration":184884},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.mp3","size":2957479,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"ad959a47f067a73022cfa8996902483a","duration":184884},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.0000000.jpg","size":347431,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"bd583c6288aa40640aef4746830a7989","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05_1024x576.mp4","size":293514825,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"308e1b431f3d1dce691274f339b8bacc","duration":184884},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05/59dcbced-b544-4b21-8b3d-1aedf3127c05.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_2ffaac7b-c21e-4904-85b9-579247485bcb","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"And once again on this Friday, we are taking weather on the road, getting outside with meteorologist Matt Hammer. I mean, we're giving that a little bit of a break. He had such a busy day yesterday with all the storm coverage. Now he gets to be near the water talking about today's forecast and of course, some boating safety. All right, safety. First, I'm sporting a life jacket as you have to when you're on a boat. Right. Yeah, it is safe boating week. We're getting into prime boating season here across the Hudson Valley and we know that from the novice to the experts just important to kind of get the right mindset as we get into this boating season. So joining me again, Chuck Bryant from Seat to Central Hudson. And right now we're going to talk about just about preparing the boat initially before you head out on the water. So what are some important things in terms of just generally to check before you head out in the water on your boat? So, absolutely, especially as we're getting into Memorial Day weekend with the start of the season here on the river. Um, we're taking off the shrink wrap and we're getting the boats in the water. Some of them are obvious like the fuel, the batteries you want to make sure your batteries are current, they have a charge on them, oil in the engines, all the really basic stuff. Um, what we like to use is a checklist, both for the preseason, make sure you got everything done and then also a departure checklist before you go out on the water. And let's talk a little bit about the sea. The equipment that is on the boat, they have to check too. It's not just the engine, right. It's not just the overall things. It's making sure that everyone is going to be safe on that trip. So, what are some things that you have on the boat to be safe and have a fun day? Sure. So, yeah, a lot of requirements. Life jackets are absolutely required. You need as many life jackets as you have people on board. When you own a boat, you'll find, you have a lot of new friends. So you want to make sure you have extra life jackets for those unexpected guests. And also something important too that people might not think about that. Every boat has to have too is a fire extinguisher. Right. Of course. So if the boat's got an engine, you need a fire extinguisher, that's a federal regulation. There's some other federal requirements including flares. So, again, this is something I'd put on my checklist every season to make sure your flares are current because they do expire. So, basically you just want to keep a methodical eye on things and just making sure you take the time to kind of make sure everything's buttoned up is, is how you can have a safe fun day on the water. Right. Absolutely. All right. So we'll be talking more with Sito Central Hudson about these basic safety tips, but getting out on the water to having some fun and talking about what you can do to make sure you have a fun, safe environment with not just yourself but your entire family friends, whoever you bring out on a boating adventure this boating season right now, we are going to talk about our weather forecast as well. Get you out the door beautiful day after those storms yesterday across the Hudson Valley. So the outlook for the rest of the day today, we are looking at sunshine some partly cloudy skies at times, temperatures in the low eighties right on through the afternoon. And overall it's just going to be a really nice summer day. Actually, a great boating day. Pick the perfect day.

We also need to get in a different mindset. Right. We're getting back outside. I mean, it's foggy this morning, Matt. Can you do anything about it? Because from our vantage point here, it doesn't look that good, but I'm seeing a few breaks of sun where you are. So please make it better for us. You might be able to see me squinting a little bit. I mean, yeah, we're already seeing improvements thankfully, not too long ago. I mean, we had just thick fog all across the Hudson river. Now starting to see that burn off a little bit, still a touch of it left, but that should continue to burn off over the next few minutes. Thankfully, because coming up a little bit later, we'll actually take one of the sea tow boats out on the water and talk about some safety things there. So joining me again right now is Walter Garage and he is captain at sit to Central Hudson River and thank you again for joining us. We talked a little bit earlier about some of the safety things. You should have on board. One of them, which we don't want to brush over is one of the most important really. And that is your life jacket. And so right now I think it's important to kind of show the people how exactly to put one of these things on. Right. If you're someone who's never been on a boat before, not used to it. Sure, you might get a brief demonstration demonstration day of, but let's go over right now how to put these on and how to make sure it is secured proper here. I've got one of them your size. All righty. So basically is just like first life jacket demonstration live on TV. Love it already messing it up. I did. Here we go. All right. Pull it up. Simple buckle 12 and then you, and then you can snug it up and then you don't know how tight do you want these? Make them tight? Because when you pop in the water, they actually get under your chin. So that way if you have them snugged up, you're not, you're feeling more comfortable, easy enough. And your, yours has a special feature. Yeah, mine are the automatic self inflating. So if I fall in the water a little hydrostatic releases in here and basically the, the jacket will pop up within a split second and it's super comfortable. And I think the best thing about this too is talk a little bit about the loner stations, life jacket stations. Sito has basically through our foundation, the Sito Foundation in Boating safety.com. We have placed thousands of these life jackets around the country, not just where, you know, any lake, whether it's the Midwest, the west coast and up and down the east coast. These are basically available for you have guests coming in like, oh my gosh. I don't have anything for the little free. Right. These are totally free. You know, the marinas are kind enough to post these and have them for us. And the idea obviously is you take it out on the water, you bring it back, you return it. And I think it's a great program and this is unbelievable because most folks are all sizes. Yeah, exactly. Just another way you could make sure you're staying safe on the water during this voting season. So we'll talk more about this coming up throughout the and get out on the Hudson River in a little bit right now. We're looking at the bridge camera right now. You have some sunshine overhead for sure. And we have a little bit of that fog still lingering that will burn off over the next little while. I'm going to support this thing for the rest of this weather segment. All right, everybody for the rest of this Friday, nice day. Not only does it start to look nice through the morning, but we have lower humidity compared to yesterday. It will feel great. It will look really nice as well through the rest of today. So our morning temperatures have been kind of mild range a little bit from some fifties, north and west, mostly in the sixties to some lower seventies. And we will be off to the races with temperatures. Now, the sun's up and we'll have highs hitting the eighties during this afternoon all the while just a light breeze and overall really enjoyable outdoor day this time of the year though, make sure you're using that sunscreen to UV index is going to be high today and burn time gonna be as little as around 10 to 15 minutes. So, coming up in just a little bit, we will have much more Skyler day harmon. We'll have your full 10 day forecast in just a few minutes.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316/ad4f49b1-1560-4648-8eb2-593d23898316.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"Follow local boating regulations and avoid boating under the influence for everyone's safety.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"5L5ACfaBHdxtrQTyEjAJyG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-24T11:42:15.015Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T11:45:26.838Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"524WCmatt7_2024-05-24-07-41-55","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"1Sez4u2fvZx205XmpIUIA1","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-24T11:42:14.392Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T11:42:14.392Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"524WCmatt7_2024-05-24-07-41-55","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/1Sez4u2fvZx205XmpIUIA1/72d8f092eeaeaea17c88d97ed3121c76/501a7296-d933-48b2-a68b-729ba0c3f0d3.jpg","details":{"size":278133,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"501a7296-d933-48b2-a68b-729ba0c3f0d3.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"524WCmatt7_2024-05-24-07-41-55.mxf","duration":158,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"daf4d5ed54edbacc535c7b39e3615f4d","size":582204796,"source":"uploads/news12/524WCmatt7_2024-05-24-07-41-55","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.mp4","size":250360250,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"6efb6aceb4ee76f4cfd05a024f3a543f","duration":157357},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17_854x480.mp4","size":51492666,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"22358521bdbbf5389a679ac540c7787e","duration":157357},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.mp3","size":2516950,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"cff30f10ac00bf1e446f2812421f05f8","duration":157357},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.0000000.jpg","size":174024,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"cf4668c9916fa4eab14e8e6f1a852789","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17_1024x576.mp4","size":250268901,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"c431f57d2b02917a37367e3e12afc3a1","duration":157357},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_f20a8a9b-34e9-4463-be2c-e2659b6ce7f7","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"Reminder this weekend and always to respect the water. Your time out there on the boat is meant to be enjoyable, but it's also something that you need to be taken seriously. Meteorologist Matt Hammer is getting his shot into focus for us. Hey, you're on a dock. Things are moving. We're grooving this morning. Good morning. It's an amazing weather day too. And yeah, so far this morning as part of safe boating and we're here with Sito Central Hudson River, talking about all the safety procedures need to take before you head out on the water. We've covered what you generally have to take care of in terms of looking at the boat, making sure the proper safety equipment is on the boat and things like that. But there's also important things like safety regulations that people need to take into account as well. So what are some of those that people need to keep in mind? Absolutely. In addition to the equipment regulations for safety and life saving, there are prerequisite courses now for safe boating on the Hudson Brianna's law is now mandatory as of 2024 that all voters born after 1978 are required to have a New York State voting safety certificate and where can people find more about those regulations? Uh New York State Parks Department runs the voting education um service for the state boating safety.com is also a great resource as is the coast guard auxiliary. Great. And just quickly to touch on what are some of the, the most common issues that you kind of see develop here on the Hudson River in boating season. This one is sort of a face palm moment. It's always the running out of fuel and that seems to be one of our most common ones. Other than that, it's, you know, an engine difficulty or battery issues. So we're going to get on the Hudson river, we've covered almost pretty much everything in terms of the prep safety regulations. We are going to actually take this, take weather on the water coming up in the next hour and it's going to be a lot of fun. We'll talk more about how to have a safe fun day out on the water in just a little bit right now. We're taking a look at the Mario Cuomo bridge behind me and you can see it there from that view as well and it's looking really, really nice after some early fog that we did have and, and that's completely almost burned off at this point. It's going to be a beautiful rest of the day all throughout the lower Hudson Valley with not only a lot of sunshine but some lower humidity compared to the past couple of days and temperatures that warm up nicely into the lower eighties this afternoon. As you see right here on that day, planner, mid eighties this afternoon, lower humidity. What could you ask more for really? For him? From a, from a nice summer like day here across the Hudson Valley. So the future cast the dry weather for this afternoon into this evening and overnight tonight. And we'll have overall a nice Memorial Day weekend coming up. The one thing I can't rule out is a spotty shower late in the day. Tomorrow. We're going to talk much more about that with Skyler Day Harmon and the full 10 day forecast in just a little bit.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17/b5ef3291-6627-4102-809b-99d8c53cff17.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"value":"Practice emergency protocols to ensure readiness in case of a crisis on the water.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"7u7P5YrR4lB5SYkhOUkDAl","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-24T12:28:48.473Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T12:31:54.018Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"524WCmatt8_2024-05-24-08-28-28","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"1NGL54RB5ePBmwYcJca14A","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-24T12:28:47.815Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T12:28:47.815Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"524WCmatt8_2024-05-24-08-28-28","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/1NGL54RB5ePBmwYcJca14A/3eb324f8cc954015f5e3d8599980466d/22209896-c213-49d8-a17a-d42985fa0c6e.jpg","details":{"size":169199,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"22209896-c213-49d8-a17a-d42985fa0c6e.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"524WCmatt8_2024-05-24-08-28-28.mxf","duration":137,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"9ce40290b154e66a53bd7a6b0db24b8d","size":528514936,"source":"uploads/news12/524WCmatt8_2024-05-24-08-28-28","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.mp4","size":216874579,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"08e677e0ed955fdc3ec7c8739e3fa9e3","duration":136402},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf_854x480.mp4","size":44559083,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"efbd41565b035b042ca186cbb52f123f","duration":136402},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.mp3","size":2181746,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"285934a1cef488f4b90b460b723ef966","duration":136402},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.0000000.jpg","size":154533,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"7081ccc30e504d3c0026476ed841ad86","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf_1024x576.mp4","size":216989317,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"139068a66def8f56f87228f18a69c66c","duration":136402},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_7193a7cd-0167-443a-8f4a-69d0cc4d2a27","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"Meteorologist Matt Hammer is already getting his Memorial day weekend jump started. He found himself a great spot with some great company with a great message too and an important one, Matt, and that's the thing, right. We're talking about safety this morning, but we're talking about safety so you can enjoy yourself on the water and have that fun too and, and have safe fun. That's what we're all about here. That's what Sito is all about Walter Gars and joining us again, captain here for Sito Central Hudson River. And so as we kind of find ourselves out on the river, as so many people will be this boating season. Talk to me a little bit about if someone finds themselves in a true emergency, which they do. 1st, 1st you get on the Marine Radio channel 16 on every radio will broadcast where, where you are and what's happening. And then another person could be dialing or should be dialing 911 because there's law enforcement boats on the river and on the sound that can respond and a true emergency. They're the first line of defense. But then if say someone like we were talking about earlier, runs out of fuel. They get stuck, those non emergency assistance services. That's where Sito comes in. Right. That's what we do. We're the marine assistance provider here on the Hudson and nationwide. It's what we do every day. We come to the rescue as well because sometimes our boats are up and down the waters, you know, daily patrolling and then we can help you tow you home, you know, you buy a seat to membership. It's very much like AAA or a road service at sea as we like to call it. And you indeed just call one number and you'll get one of us to come and help you and bring you home, bring you gas, give you a battery jump. It's what we do. We want to make the day better, you know, and we get you home without too much trouble or get you going again. It's all fun for the family and just to know that service is available is great. And for more information, not only on that, but all boating safety, you can add to boating safety.com as well. And we'll have all that up on News twelve.com for you throughout day today and that link will live forever on news twelve.com. So for more on today's weather, we are looking at a gorgeous day, a great, great day to be out on the water. Looking at the Mario Cuomo bridge right now, we are looking at some beautiful sunshine and, and we have a day planner that are really shows the temperatures getting up into the eighties this afternoon with a lot of sun coming up in just a few minutes. Skyler Day. Harmon will be back looking ahead, not only at this feature cast but a full look ahead to Memorial Day Weekend as well.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf/3c2437af-18c9-4e93-ad23-e9d8c613c4bf.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"6s5rFgfUHTAJ3qTxhxWjJv","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-05-24T13:29:14.850Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T13:32:39.518Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":6,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"videoFile"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"524WCmatt830_2024-05-24-09-28-58","thumbnail":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"24gFNayvj9fJemd797FKuq","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-05-24T13:29:14.144Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-24T13:29:14.144Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"524WCmatt830_2024-05-24-09-28-58","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/3kqcuzntcg31/24gFNayvj9fJemd797FKuq/1e55d54e55473c9858b60ff4bbe6b4f1/0c8fa93a-4f47-4d9a-96e8-4ac76329dfb1.jpg","details":{"size":242206,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"fileName":"0c8fa93a-4f47-4d9a-96e8-4ac76329dfb1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"filename":"524WCmatt830_2024-05-24-09-28-58.mxf","duration":175,"captions":{"en_US.srt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.transcribe.srt","en_US.vtt":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.transcribe.vtt"},"isLive":false,"md5sum":"9056b9dfd15fd328c2ccec025cdc1d34","size":669125827,"source":"uploads/news12/524WCmatt830_2024-05-24-09-28-58","transcodes":{"video/mp4":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.mp4","size":276926123,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"a574dfdebd86b2685227ebeec4f8c6d1","duration":174240},"video/vga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054_854x480.mp4","size":57012608,"width":854,"height":480,"checksum":"f91d7ab89578830c943d83762e8f8276","duration":174240},"audio/mpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.mp3","size":2787369,"width":0,"height":0,"checksum":"7a22243260e872f4df6ac78d76a4bb77","duration":174240},"image/jpeg":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.0000000.jpg","size":184726,"width":1920,"height":1080,"checksum":"384efe93345105a7760ba51c7db220c4","duration":34},"video/wsvga":{"url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054_1024x576.mp4","size":276654303,"width":1024,"height":576,"checksum":"d7db36547dbcb98aa02a914a55ab6db8","duration":174240},"application/x-mpegURL":{"url":"s3://cheddar-production/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.m3u8"}},"transcodingStatus":"COMPLETED","transcribeJobName":"production_82227444-f219-40cc-bc2b-b532be760e77","transcribeStatus":"COMPLETED","transcript":"Matt Hammer is back with us this morning with the best vantage point of the day. He is talking all things Memorial Day Weekend, including Paramount. In addition, of course to honoring the fallen voting safety. We want you to be well in the know out there so you can enjoy the time with your family that what are the tips and you know, for the experts, these tips, you know, our second nature, but it's just important to get the right mindset, especially if you're a beginner or novice. And yes, some of the basic tips that we're talking about just making sure you check out the boat, having a life jackets on board and everything that we've gone over this morning, which is available on News twelve.com for you. And the full story will be there the entire day, of course. But right now I'm joined again by Walter to Central Hudson River. And we want to go over just if someone does need assistance from see to what is that experience like? Well, they, most of the calls come in through our 1 800 number and we get this digitally dispatched. So our captains will receive a text with the location of where the customer is broken down. Excuse me, we will come out and find you come alongside the boat you have anchored at that point to be, to be stable in one place and we'll come alongside and the boat with its fender is out and we'll either fix the boat on the spot for you. If it's that simple, we'll give you gas or a battery jump or end up telling you back, you know, you back to your marina, the bo wherever you started from that day, either way you'll take care of it and get them back to safety and for true emergencies, of course, call 911 and with true emergency personnel. So thank you so much for joining us this morning, more news, twelve.com and everything that we've gone over so far this morning. And as we go throughout the rest of today and it's a memorial day weekend. Weather plays a pivotal role as well as take a look from the Mario Cuomo bridge vantage point right now from Tarry Town, looking at a beautiful day. We're right next to it. I'm looking it up myself. We have some high thin c clouds. It's beautiful out here and it feels nice as well with some lowering humidity and also temperatures that you get up into the eighties this afternoon. So as we go throughout the rest of the day today, we are looking at again, temperatures heading up into the eighties sunshine to partly cloudy skies. Then going forward time into Memorial Day weekend. On this feature cast, you can tell that not only is it dry today, but even the start of Saturday will be dry. The one little hiccup we might have is a spotty shower popping up late in the day tomorrow and keep in mind outdoor weather while it's nice can be difficult for some allergy sufferers as well. So you're taking a look at that rob and allergy report and the grass pollen high and also the tree pollen so very high two main culprit. So by this evening, after nice day today and overnight temperatures cool up just a little bit, it's comfortable and then into tomorrow overall, a nice Saturday, other than that spotty shower around late in the day and highs in the upper seventies to lower eighties. Now, beyond that, we are looking at a decent day for Sunday as well by Memorial Day, Monday, scattered showers around. Unfortunately, Memorial Day is the most unsettled day over this holiday weekend. Coming up much more, coming up in just a couple of minutes.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.mxf","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054/b0423df2-09fa-4500-9ea5-77ddb29c8054.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"description":"To

We still and their demands for contract negotiations to speed up are gaining a new momentum of its own. David Israel is with the Mount Vernon Federation of Teachers. He is also a proud educator. I feel very fortunate to be helping them transition on to college. But right now he and his team feel undervalued and underpaid. He says they haven't gotten new contracts in years and they're losing teachers fast to other districts that are paying more. Me personally, I am maxed out on a scale that maxed out in 2021. That's why coming to school board meetings like these are so important. However, the teachers want more space. One meeting already had to be canceled this week because the room was overcrowded. And on Thursday night, teachers again came out in full force but not everyone made it inside. They said only 84 people could come in the room. We had over well over 120. So we had people lined around the side that couldn't come in. The school district's attorney says they encourage teachers to keep coming out. But school leaders still have to follow the law whether it is fire hazard or anything else.

Dozens of teachers here in Mount Vernon are tired of contract negotiations dragging on with the district and they are making that very well known to school leaders. Now, this was a regularly scheduled board meeting earlier this evening, members of the Mount Vernon Federation of Teachers first rallied outside of the district office before coming inside moments before the meeting was supposed to begin, it was then canceled. Teachers tell us these contract negotiations have been going on for two years and they are tired of waiting. We do just as much as the other districts and we deserve a federal contract as well. That term fair has to be defined and that's where negotiations come in to really try to defy what fear is now. All of this is happening as voting results are coming in for next year's school budget. That's $271 million with no increase for taxpayers. At last check, those votes were still being counted.

So are we done with the storms for a while? Addison? Yes, absolutely. So, Anton, that especially those big rain maker like we did see last night while we didn't see any flood roads come through. It did involve some standing water and a few roadways. But as we move through the next few days, drier weather is slowly settling in, especially as you going through your day. On Saturday, Sunday does have a rain chance that is starting to rise. We'll show you where coming up and going through next week. A few pop up thunderstorms are in the forecast. Speaking of pop up, we may get a stray shower too, popping up as we go through the evening hours tonight, around 67 to 8 o'clock, especially west of the Hudson River, west of 87. You can see right there outside the Middletown area and going towards 815 or so. That's one little cell still drifting down across portions of Orange County, eventually going past the border and towards New Jersey. As we go past 910 o'clock, we see fair skies slowly setting up shopping us to start off our Friday with a delightful weather trend and then going in through a day on Friday, it's going to be downright marvelous as you move through your forecast for the overnight hours tonight. Clo skies are slowly clearing out, especially towards the north and west. There may be a touch of a cool, crisp feeling closer towards the Catskills as you go through your day on Saturday at our pick of the week, 80 degrees and sunny skies, Sunday, an increase in cloud cover with a straight shower chance towards a tail end.","transcriptUrl":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.transcribe","url":"https://cheddar-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.mov","videoUrls":{"video/mp4":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.mp4","video/vga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa_854x480.mp4","audio/mpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.mp3","image/jpeg":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.0000000.jpg","video/wsvga":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa_1024x576.mp4","application/x-mpegURL":"https://vod.chdrstatic.com/transcode/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa/e85d6ec1-7302-42af-abfb-136ff0c54baa.m3u8"},"height":1080,"width":1920}}},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3kqcuzntcg31"}},"id":"westchester","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-01-11T18:10:33.159Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-30T23:07:35.343Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":128081,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"weatherConditions"}},"locale":"en-US"}}]}},"page":"/weather","query":{},"buildId":"egVwjwZqymxNgXeneCWjr","runtimeConfig":{"googlePlaceApiKey":"AIzaSyDjliYx5mRRYDo94yOfru_mfrBatZto0N4","airship":{"vapidPublicKey":"BEclaI3kB3YtSt76VmRJStsjRpJY_XrdOayrZN5G9F5wmU6mOQ5gK1c7DJWiMZ7nvNjFgMJlOouoR0DUHq4PhXQ=","websitePushId":"web.com.news12.crunch","appKey":"D1OiZ3Z0TIu5g0N_2HmfQQ","token":"MTpEMU9pWjNaMFRJdTVnME5fMkhtZlFROjZHVU9tSG5LdFBxZDY0eDFpLUt1eEhQWUc5TjhUbFdDV05hejJCU2doNDg"}},"isFallback":false,"isExperimentalCompile":false,"gssp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
