The Davenport Police and Fire Departments were called to an address on Imperial Court for a report of a structure fire on May 29 at about 5:26 p.m. First responders encountered Joshua Musgrow, 33, who lives at the same address. According to the arrest affidavit, Musgrow is accused of physically resisting police officers by entering the fire and preventing firefighters from extinguishing the blaze. Officers told Musgrow several times that he must leave the building for his own safety, but he refused. He was still refusing to leave when officers began physically pushing him away.

Musgrow is accused of assaulting two police officers at the scene of the fire. The affidavit says he assaulted one officer with an elbow strike to the face and assaulted another by clenching his fists and making statements to assault officers.



He was arrested and charged with two counts of assault on persons in certain occupations, a misdemeanor, and one count of interference with official acts, also a misdemeanor. He was released after posting bond. </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="4"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;ourquadcities.png" alt="OurQuadCities.com" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;news&#47;local-news&#47;gov-reynolds-to-speak-at-davenport-conference&#47;" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="128063"> <img src="media&#47;128063&#47;76864-photoThumbnail-320x240.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Gov.

The event, held in front of a new Great Dane semi-trailer adorned with EICC logos and images, marked a significant milestone for both the college and the community.Â 



(Eastern Iowa Community Colleges)


About 40 attendees, including EICC faculty, staff, local legislators, members of the Greater Muscatine Chamber of Commerce, and the public, gathered May 22 on the new DOT-approved training range. This range, along with four new tractor-trailer combinations and the expansion of Scott Community Collegeâs truck driving program, was made possible by a $797,000 grant from Iowa Workforce Development and an additional $500,000 investment from EICC.Â 



Lindsey Trumbull, membership and community development coordinator for the Greater Muscatine Chamber of Commerce &#38; Industry, kicked off the ceremony, highlighting the importance of such initiatives in fostering community development and economic growth.Â 



Naomi DeWinter, president of MCC, highlighted the impact of the new program on the local community: âThe vision of Eastern Iowa Community Colleges is to change lives and build communities. What we are celebrating today is another addition to the Muscatine community that does just that, through access to a short-term training program in a high-demand field.â



The expansion of the CDL program to MCC is set to meet the rising demand for CDL-trained professionals. Starting this summer, the new DOT-approved training range at MCC will be operational, with classes beginning on June 1. Students will gain hands-on experience behind the wheel of tractor-trailers equipped with modern Electronic Logging Devices.Â 



Michelle Almandinger, board chair of the Greater Muscatine Chamber of Commerce &#38; Industry, and David Riggan from TanTara Transportation, also spoke to the crowd, expressing excitement about the programâs potential to bolster the local workforce and support regional businesses.Â 



âIn 2020, our industry was thrust into the spotlight, highlighting the crucial role of truck drivers,â Riggan explained. âThis recognition allowed us to increase our rates and, in turn, raise wages. At TanTara, most of our truck drivers now earn between $80,000 and $115,000.â



Tom Monroe, CDL - Truck Driving Program Manager at EICC, emphasized the program&#39;s commitment to safety and student success. âThe CDL program at EICC has come a long way in its 50 years.

This initiative aims to promote the importance of permanent identification for pets, ensuring they can be easily reunited with their families if they become lost.



(qcawc.org)



Micro-chipping is a simple, safe, and effective way to provide your pet with lifelong identification. Unlike collars and tags that can fall off or be removed, a microchip is a permanent form of identification and can be scanned by veterinarians, humane societies, and animal shelters.



&#34;We are dedicated to the well-being of all pets in our community,&#34; said Shayenne Stiegler, clinic manager at the QCAWC. &#34;By offering affordable micro-chipping, we hope to increase the number of pets that can be safely and quickly returned to their owners if they become lost.&#34;



For more information on how to take advantage of this special offer and to find the schedule for our drive-up and mobile clinics, visit here. 



The Quad City Animal Welfare Center (QCAWC) is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing shelter, medical care, and adoption services for homeless animals. It also offers community outreach programs, including low-cost spay&#47;neuter services, vaccination clinics, and pet education resources.



The Quad City Animal Welfare Center Adoption &#38; Education Center is at 724 2nd W. Avenue in Milan.



The Quad City Animal Welfare Center Spay&#47;Neuter &#38; Wellness Clinic is at 612 1st W. Street in Milan.

Rose Smith has been a bus driver for decades. A tornado touched down in Coyne Center Friday as kids were headed to school. Smith took a detour to shelter the students and arrived at a former school for safety.



Smith says this situation has never happened to her before. &#34;One little boy kept saying, &#39;oh, my God; we&#39;re going to die,&#39;&#34; Smith said. &#34;I said, &#39;no, you&#39;re not. Miss Rose will take care of you.&#39;&#34;



In a tough situation, Smith made sure to keep her kids safe. &#34;They were pretty scared, but they all did a great job,&#34; Smith said. &#34;It&#39;s my job to keep them kids safe, so I feel like they&#39;re my kids when they&#39;re on my bus. They&#39;re my responsibility. I did what I did because it&#39;s my job.&#34;



Students on the bus that day were experiencing the same shock their own bus driver was. &#34;We got hail and a lot of rain,&#34; Smith said. &#34;I was jut trying to make it to Coyne Center, and then they told me to go to my building. I don&#39;t have a building in Coyne Center, or even a post office to go to and take shelter. I thought the best thing would be the former Coyne Center School.&#34;



Students on the bus were happy that Smith was the driver and led them to safety. &#34;I was feeling scared that we might die or something,&#34; Kayden Smith, a Sherrard 5th grader, said. &#34;Once the notification came on my phone that there was an emergency for a tornado warning, I was scared and texted my parents to tell them about the tornado.&#34;



&#34;I&#39;m just happy that she took us to a safe place in the building,&#34; said Jaxon Beaulieu, a Sherrard 5th grader. 



&#34;My parents were a little on the scared side also, and I thank miss Rose because of her hard work and what she did for us to keep us safe,&#34; said Knox Driessens, a Sherrard 5th grader.



Parents were informed by the school as the tornado was taking shape Friday morning, and the district received a lot of social media comments from parents. They detailed how thankful they are to have Smith as a bus driver. 



&#34;She deserves some credit, and she deserves the recognition,&#34; Dr. Carl Johnson, Superintendent for the Sherrard School District, said. &#34;We teased her a little bit on Friday at our luncheon about that, and just typical Rose she smiled and said &#39;just doing my job.&#39; But again, it&#39;s nice to know that the community recognizes when somebody is doing an outstanding job going above and beyond.&#34;



Even after the rounds of severe weather, Smith credits the willingness and cooperation of the kids she oversees as the real reason everyone was safe and sound. &#34;My kids were excellent,&#34; Smith said. &#34;They must have a lot of training in school because they went right away in the hallways and sat down. They were quiet, and they were great.&#34; </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.rcreader.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="8"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;rcreader.png" alt="River Cities&#39; Reader" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a class="source" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.rcreader.com&#47;" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="8"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;rcreader.png" alt="River Cities&#39; Reader" /> </a> <h3> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.rcreader.com&#47;music&#47;free-throw-raccoon-motel-jun10" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="128002"> Free Throw, June 10 </a> </h3> <p> Touring in support of their 2023 album Lessons That We Swear to Keep, a recording that New Noise magazine said &#34;does a remarkable job at helping listeners discover comfort within the chaos,&#34; the emo and indie-rock ensemble Free Throw headlines a June 10 concert at Davenport&#39;s Raccoon Motel, New Noise adding that &#34;the lyrical content is effortlessly intriguing, painting a picture of the difficulties of self-worth, regrets of possible wasted potential, as well as not being afraid of giving yourself a break.&#34; </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a class="source" href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> <h3> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.wqad.com&#47;video&#47;news&#47;local&#47;the-current&#47;check-out-some-live-music-with-dad-at-the-56th-annual-geneseo-music-festival-june-14-16&#47;526-6c4edf2d-5a75-4f73-8a70-d35fe76e06bb" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="127999"> Check out some live music with dad at the 56th Annual Geneseo Music Festival June 14-16 </a> </h3> <p> âThe annual event is open to all ages and will feature music performances, food vendors and family-friendly activities. </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a class="source" href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> <h3> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.wqad.com&#47;video&#47;news&#47;local&#47;good-news&#47;davenport-seniors-visit-former-elementary-schools-to-celebrate-graduation&#47;526-f6cf5c37-2df2-4a8e-a47d-32701cd6d7b8" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="127998"> Davenport seniors visit former elementary schools to celebrate graduation </a> </h3> <p> The &#34;Senior Walk&#34; tradition started about five years ago. </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a class="source" href="https:&#47;&#47;wqad.com&#47;" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="2"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;wqad.png" alt="WQAD.com" /> </a> <h3> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.wqad.com&#47;video&#47;news&#47;local&#47;the-current&#47;cookies-anyone-how-illinois-researchers-turned-plastic-into-3d-printed-food&#47;526-9bbdbf01-2e63-4102-82cd-996c6d60eab8" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="127997"> Cookies, anyone?

This vibrant celebration of diversity and inclusion will be held from Friday, May 31 to Saturday, June 1, offering a dynamic lineup of entertainment, activities, and community engagement. The hours are 4 p.m. to midnight Friday, and noon to midnight Saturday, with $10 admission each day.






With a packed entertainment lineup each day, the headliners are:




Friday Night: Ada Vox, renowned for her powerful performances on &#34;Queen of the Universe&#34; and &#34;American Idol,&#34; will take the stage to dazzle the crowd with her extraordinary talent.





Saturday Night: Elliott With 2 T&#39;s, a standout star from &#34;RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race,&#34; will headline with a show-stopping performance sure to captivate and entertain.







The festival will feature an array of drag shows, live bands, and diverse entertainment acts throughout both days. Attendees can look forward to an eclectic mix of music, dance, and theatrical performances that celebrate the spirit of Pride.



In addition to the entertainment, the festival grounds will host a variety of food vendors offering delicious fare to satisfy all tastes. Local businesses and community organizations will also be on hand, showcasing their products and services, providing information, and engaging with festival-goers. This is a perfect opportunity to support local enterprises and discover the richness of the Quad Cities community.

&#34;We are incredibly excited about this year&#39;s Pride Festival,&#34; said Daniel Gleason, president of Quad Cities Pride Alliance. &#34;Our goal is to create a welcoming and joyous space for everyone to celebrate love, acceptance, and the vibrant diversity of our community. With amazing headliners like Ada Vox and Elliott with 2 T&#39;s, we know this will be a festival to remember.&#34;



Quad Cities Pride Alliance is dedicated to promoting equality, visibility, and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community in the QC region. Through events, outreach, and advocacy, the organization works tirelessly to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all individuals.






QC Pride is hosting the annual QC Unity Pride Parade June 1, starting at 11 a.m. at 2nd and Iowa streets in Davenport, heading down 2nd Street to the Centennial Bridge, crossing over to Illinois, down 3rd Avenue and heading to the entry way of theÂ Quad Cities Pride FestivalÂ atÂ Schwiebert Riverfront Park, located at 101 17th St., Rock Island. Enjoy candy, music and creativity at this family-friendly event.



Parade entry is free. To register or for more information, clickÂ here.



Grand marshal and host excited



Elliott With 2 T&#39;s (who is based in Las Vegas) and the Rock Island-based Chad Rose (who performs as drag queen Bentley Balenciaga) are the grand marshals for the parade and Balenciaga is host for the two-day festival.



Elliott With 2 T&#39;s, left, and Bentley Balenciaga will be grand marshals of the QC Pride Parade and are co-cruise directors for the Big Gay Cruise.


&#34;I&#39;m super excited,&#34; Rose -- who has performed drag around the world for six years -- said Wednesday. She is a two-year member of the Pride Alliance board and also is co-cruise director (with Elliott) of the Big Gay Cruise, with Royal Caribbean.



&#34;I&#39;ve always been in love with the art form,&#34; Rose said of drag, noting she&#39;s participated in the Pride Fest pride pageant in 2019, and won first place in 2021. She called Bentley an &#34;old school&#34; drag queen -- with lots of glitz and feathers, big hair, big boobs and a big personality.



A scene from the 2023 Pride Fest at Schwiebert Park.


&#34;I&#39;m very much an extrovert -- it&#39;s an amplification of my own persona,&#34; she said. &#34;People are more forgiving when I&#39;m performing. I can be more cutting in my comments. If I&#39;m not in drag, it&#39;s just mean.&#34;



Doing the Pride Parade and Pride Fest is important to give back to the community, Rose said. Her full-time job is working from home for the virtual call center Alorica. Rose also will perform at a Pride Fest after-party Saturday night 11 pm. to 2 a.m. at The Speakeasy, 1818 3rd Ave., Rock Island. Those tickets are $5 in advance and $10 at the door.






The Big Gay Cruise is a five-day cruise not only for the LGBTQ+ community, but their allies, Rose said. This October, it will leave from Galveston, Tex., and next February, leaves from Miami, Fla.  



With much anti-LGBTQ sentiment across the country, Rose said &#34;it&#39;s important to focus on the positive...Love is love.&#34; As Bentley, she will perform at Pride events June 15 at Bass Street Landing, Moline, and June 30 at UP Skybar, downtown Davenport.

Last school year (2022-2023), RIMSD #41 implemented the Illinois State Seal of Biliteracy and the Commendation toward Biliteracy for students who attain proficiency in English and another language.



At the Board of Education meeting on Tuesday are, from left, Superintendent Dr. Williams, Debra Fraznt - EL Program director, Shalom Moore, Asa Mahn, Israa Al Janabi, Dr. Ruggeberg - assistant superintendent of teaching and learning. (Rock Island-Milan School District)



Already the district has seen its first several students obtain that Seal of Biliteracy or the commendations toward Biliteracy.



The Illinois Seal of Biliteracy (SoBL) recognizes high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in English and in one or more other world languages. This recognition is designated on a student&#39;s transcript and high school diploma. Students will have a medal with the Illinois SoBL on it to wear during the commencement ceremony. It also is a definite statement of accomplishment to future employers, colleges, and universities.



Per Illinois State statute, colleges and public universities are required to award course credit to a student who has received a State Seal of Biliteracy.To earn the Seal of Biliteracy students must exhibit proficiency in both English and a world language via assessments. Students have to receive a high composite score that includes listening, reading, writing, and speaking.Seal of Biliteracyâ¢ Israa Al Janabi -Arabicâ¢ Joshua Galeana -Spanishâ¢ Asa Mahn -Spanishâ¢ Dinye Ntiruvakure -Kinyarwanda



Commendationâ¢ Presley Behrens - Spanishâ¢ Shalom Moore - Germanâ¢ Asia Stern -Spanishâ¢ Ashley Vazquez-Chavarria â Spanishâ¢ Elijah Voorhis - Spanish



The district&#39;s English Language (EL) Program in collaboration with the RIHS World Language and English Departments aim to develop students into biliterate adults who can actively contribute to the global world. These awards encourage all students to study other languages.



Additionally, these awards increase employment and earning opportunities through the formal recognition of language and biliteracy skills. The district pays for all costs associated with the program thanks to a grant received from the Rock Island-Milan Education Foundation.

This year is the 30th anniversary of the nonprofit organization (at the historic four-story former hotel at 2nd and Gaines), and this Saturday is the perfect time to visit.



The German American Heritage Center, at 2nd and Gaines streets in Davenport, is in a former 1860s-era hotel that served German immigrants to the area.



On June 1, GAHC will host a Family Free Day from noon to 4 p.m., with free admission to the museum. There will be childrenâs activities with the opening of the new first-floor exhibition, &#34;Immigration Then and Now: Finding Refuge in the Quad Cities.&#34;



They will have guided tours of the exhibition at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. MozBites will be on site selling food from 1:30-4, and you can enjoy live music from the Muzik Krauts and independent musicians who are former refugees.



Brian Allen, GAHC executive director, said Wednesday the new exhibit was supported by a $3,500 grant from Moline Regional Community Foundation, in partnership with World Relief Quad Cities. Itâs similar to past exhibits on other non-German immigrant populations.



The new exhibit &#34;Immigration Then and Now: Finding Refuge in the Quad Cities&#34; is on the first floor through Sept. 15, 2024 (photo by Jonathan Turner).


The room showcases stories of real people in the Quad Cities, and shows their journey from around the world.



Visitors to the first-floor exhibit (up through Sept. 15, 2024) can choose an ID card for an immigrant, and follow the complex process of how they get from their home country to the U.S. and QC area (with the help of World Relief), according to their immigration status â refugee, humanitarian parolee, asylum seeker or special immigration visa.

You can follow their stories from seeking help and life in transit, through temporary relocation, call to leave for good, arrival at their new home, adjustment to their new host culture, and where they are now.



In February 2022, the GAHC and Davenport-based non-profitÂ Tapestry FarmsÂ partnered on the exhibit, âOur Neighbors, Our Friends: Unsere Nachbarn, Unsere Freunde.â It explored how the organization helps new community members from all over the globe right here in West Davenport.

Last summer, the GAHC featured two exhibits on Latin-American heritage. One was a traveling exhibit from the Arizona Historical Society,Â the Migrant Quilt Project.Â Founded in Tucson in the mid-2000s, quilts memorialize stories of migrants who have died seeking refuge in the U.S.



The other was a larger exhibit,Â âWe Are All Immigrant WarriorsâÂ â a collaboration between the GAHC and the Iowa City artistÂ Miriam AlarcÃ³n AvilaÂ and her projectÂ âImmigrant Luchadores.â



That exhibit â mainly of colorful masks and photos â was an exploration that looks for the connections between immigrants of German origin and Latino immigrants.



The current immigrant exhibit includes everyday items and clothes loaned by local immigrants and refugees.



Some names have been changed for the exhibit because of security concerns, and some people featured will take part in a June 23 panel discussion at GAHC.

âIt humanizes or gives you an empathetic response to the past,â Allen said of all immigrant stories, which have common elements regardless of the time period or country of origin. âIt puts you in the place of people who came here and how hard it was. It does the same for the present, to put you in someone elseâs shoes so you can understand things that other people go through.â



One display case features German items from the GAHC permanent collection â a tool box, pocket watch with chain made from hair, and a Bible, all from the 1800s.



Companion events will include:




Sunday June 9th -- Kaffee und Kuchen: The Butterfly Effect with Danuta Hutchins, Ph.D.



Sunday June 23rd -- Kaffee und Kuchen: Modern Immigrant Panel Discussion




The QC area has a history of welcoming immigrants from Europe in the past centuries and continues to be a sanctuary for immigrants and refugees from around the world. This shared history creates a global connection through the universal experience of starting anew in a foreign land, according to GAHC.



How was GAHC formed?



Founded on Aug. 1, 1994 as a private, nonprofit organization, the GAHC seeks to preserve the heritage of our German-speaking ancestors for present and future generations and to enrich knowledge of the German immigrant experience.



Photos of the former Germania or Miller Hotel (top) in the 19th century, and restored GAHC in the building (bottom) are part of the site history in the main German Immigrant Experience on the third floor (photo by Jonathan Turner).


Today GAHC (a national historic site), has evolved a museum that includes a large permanent exhibit and two rotating special exhibits. Within the permanent exhibit, visitors enjoy an orientation theater, six education stations, and two restored hotel rooms.



Visitors enjoy an interactive experience as you learn about immigrantsâ journey by sea, train and foot, to their final destination at the German American Heritage Center building, which was originally a very busy hotel for thousands of immigrants in the 1860s. One of the highlights in the exhibit is called âStep Into My Shoes.â Visitors will find footprints of a child, woman, and man at this section.






They can step on any set of the footprints, which then triggers the corresponding character to appear before them on a screen and talk about their personal experience as an immigrant.



The GAHC building was built in the 1860s, and was originally the Standard Hotel where thousands of German immigrants stayed in the 1800s when they arrived in the area. It was originally a thin three-story building; the eastern two-thirds were added in 1875 and fourth story was added in 1877.



The GAHC saved the building from deterioration and potential demolition by raising $1.3 million to restore the exterior of the building and to restore the first and second floors for use as a historical center.






The building was purchased in 1995, partially restored in 1999, and reopened to the public in May 2000. In October 2009, GAHC debuted a newly expanded third-floor space including a new large interactive permanent exhibit called the âGerman Immigrant Experience,â two traveling exhibit spaces, and large program facilities. GAHC offers several new programs based on the new permanent exhibit and two new temporary exhibit spaces.



New beer exhibit



The rotating third-floor gallery will be converted for a new exhibit on a history of brewing in the QC, based on the 2023 book,Â âQuad Cities Beer: A History,âÂ by Michael McCarty and Kristin DeMarr.



The authors are scheduled to give a talk at GAHC on July 28.







German immigrants brought many skills and trades to Scott County, especially brewing. Historic German breweries had a huge impact on the lives of Scott County citizens in their time and the effect continues to the present day, according to the exhibit summary.



The new display will open June 2 (through Oct. 20, 2024), where you can learn about historic breweries, how Prohibition led to creative business ventures, and the booming brewing industry after the repeal of Prohibition in the 1930s.



In the permanent German Immigrant Experience exhibit, one small hotel room will be converted into a childrenâs area (to feel like a boat), and the adjoining hotel room (only visible through a window now) will be opened to the public.

One other exhibit area will updated with new signage and panels, to be done in September, Allen said, noting theyâre working with Edwards Creative.

The GAHC may have a 30th-birthday event this fall with a beer tasting, collaborating with a QC brewery, to create an Oktoberfest beer to celebrate the anniversary, he said.

The foundation has awarded 51 scholarships totaling over $109,000 to 42 seniors from the Davenport Community School District (DCSD). These scholarships support the students&#39; post-secondary education paths and come from contributions from donors who are committed to investing in the future of the districtâs students.

&#34;We&#39;re aware that the expense of higher education poses a challenge for numerous students,â said DCSD Superintendent TJ Schneckloth. âToday&#39;s allocation of 51 scholarships not only alleviates the financial burden of college but also equips our graduates to embrace lifelong learning.â



The foundationâs goal is to nurture a community of lifelong learners who will contribute positively to society through these scholarships. âWe are pleased to honor these outstanding graduates of the DCSD as they pursue the next chapter in their educational journey. Our investment in their education helps them become engaged citizens in our community,â said Sally Crino, Executive Director of the Davenport Schools Foundation.

Celebrations (at 1136 E. Locust, 303 W. Locust, and 3624 W. Locust streets) will occur from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., and will involve raffle drawings, energy drink tastings, branded giveaways and remote radio station broadcasts, according to a Wednesday release.






The Gas Spot stores have been open in Davenport since early February, and these events are a chance for the community to meet staff, win prizes, and enjoy breakfast and lunch deals all week long. The radio stations 97X, B100 and IRock93.5 will be on site doing a live broadcast and raffling off various event tickets.



Red Bull Energy Drinks will be visiting each store offering tastings of their new summer edition flavors, Curuba and Sea Blue. âThese stores are alive again and thriving,â Tiffany Fraley, CEO of InConvenience, said Wednesday. âWeâre proud to be a part of these Davenport communities.â



The Gas Spot locations are part of ICC Motor Fuel I LLC, and were closed in September of 2023 to make way for new management and site upgrades. InConvenience Inc reopened these stores after repairing equipment, cleaning stores, hiring staff and stocking with new inventory in early 2024.



These sites also underwent rounds of testing and certifications with the Iowa DNR to ensure safety and compliance for the underground gas tanks.



âOur company employees will be on site at the various locations on Saturday, and weâre ready for feedback and insights from the community,â said Fraley. âWeâre ready to hear about anything we can do to make our stores an enjoyable part of your daily lives.â



InConvenience Inc. is a women-led company focusing on providing convenience to customers, opportunities for employees, and support to communities through innovative approaches and unwavering convictions, all while maintaining a sense of humor and humility. </p> </td> </tr>     <tr> <td class="source"> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="4"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;ourquadcities.png" alt="OurQuadCities.com" /> </a> </td> <td class="article">  <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;news&#47;local-news&#47;registration-opens-soon-for-bettendorf-public-librarys-summer-reading-program&#47;" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="127965"> <img src="media&#47;127965&#47;76825-photoThumbnail-320x240.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Registration opens soon for Bettendorf Public Library&#39;s summer reading program" /> </a>  <a class="source" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;" rel="noopener external nofollow" data-source-id="4"> <img src="images&#47;logos&#47;ourquadcities.png" alt="OurQuadCities.com" /> </a> <h3> <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.ourquadcities.com&#47;news&#47;local-news&#47;registration-opens-soon-for-bettendorf-public-librarys-summer-reading-program&#47;" rel="noopener external" data-article-id="127965"> Registration opens soon for Bettendorf Public Library&#39;s summer reading program </a> </h3> <p> Summertime means itâs time for free library reading programs!
