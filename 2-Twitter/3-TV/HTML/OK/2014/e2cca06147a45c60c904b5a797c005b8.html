Okla. (KSWO) - Hello everyone! The active weather pattern continues. Due to some energy to our west and a warm front moving in from the south multiple rounds of rain and storms will be the case Thursday. The first round will roll through in the morning hours from northwest to southeast. The second will roll through east to west in the evening and early overnight hours. This round will have the best shot at producing severe winds, hail, and a stray tornado. Overall Thursday we are in a threat level 2 out of 5. This means scattered severe storms are a possibility. With any storm that develops and become severe it will have the potential to produce up to golf ball size hail, up to 70 mph wind gusts, and possibly a stray tornado. The third round late Thursday night into Friday morning is more in question. Some models are saying it will happen and other models are holding off on this round. Overall, I think storm chances will be there during this time frame they will just be smaller and the threat of these storm becoming severe will be smaller as well."},{"_id":"M5CSNOASVVCIPDWKXFNM3AYXPE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"As we head into the weekend we will begin to dry out a bit. Although, a round of storms will be probable Saturday night. So, the weekend will not be all rain free. The good news is the weather should not be bad during the daytime hours. We really lower the rain and storm chances early next week with partly cloudy skies and temps rising into the low 90′s."},{"_id":"PY4IRGWLEJHS5IVL2DNRSRUSCM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Meteorologist - Barrett Phillips"}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"barrett.phillips@gray.tv","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Barrett Phillips","org":"Lawton, OK","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/25449008-3438-4546-b8f4-2b2a573d064b.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"","url":"/authors/barrett.phillips@gray.tv/","slug":"barrett-phillips","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"barrett.phillips@kswo.com"},{"site":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/barrettwx"},{"site":"twitter","url":"@barrett_wx"},{"site":"instagram","url":"@barrett_wx"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"barrett.phillips@kswo.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/barrettwx","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"twitter","url":"@barrett_wx","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"instagram","url":"@barrett_wx","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"barrett.phillips@gray.tv","firstName":"Barrett","lastName":"Phillips","byline":"Barrett Phillips","role":"First Alert Meteorologist","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/25449008-3438-4546-b8f4-2b2a573d064b.png","email":"barrett.phillips@kswo.com","affiliations":"Member of the National Weather Association","education":[],"awards":[{"name":"National Weather Association Seal of Approval"}],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/barrettwx","twitter":"@barrett_wx","bio_page":"/authors/barrett.phillips@gray.tv/","bio":"","longBio":"Barrett graduated from the University of Oklahoma (Boomer Sooner) as a broadcast meteorologist in 2013. He had two internships at KOKH Fox 25 in Oklahoma City in the spring and summer of 2013. The internships were during the time of the 2013 spring tornado outbreaks (Moore and El Reno tornadoes). He was working in the Fox 25 weather center with then-Chief Meteorologist Jeff George and meteorologist Jon Slater behind the scenes.\n\nHe began his career at KOTA-Territory News in Rapid City, SD as a weekend meteorologist/weekday reporter. He would forecast storm systems for the Black Hills region on the weekends and send weather reports from out in the field on weekdays. It reached as low as 20 BELOW zero during his tenure in South Dakota and snowed from September to May (2014)! On June 8th the high was only 55 degrees! \n\nAfter 6 months at KOTA-Territory News in Rapid City he landed the Chief Meteorologist position at KIDY (which is currently Fox West Texas) in San Angelo, TX (2014). He went from extreme cold to extreme heat as temperatures rose to 110+ degrees for two consecutive weeks. West Texas heat waves, tornadoes, dust storms, and flash flooding were the name of the game along with strong blue northers. One December day it reached 84 degrees before falling into the 30's and snowing 3 inches by the next day. He also got to meet and work with Dr. Steve Lyons (former hurricane expert from the Weather Channel) at the National Weather Service in San Angelo.\n\nFour years later he had the opportunity to go to KALB in Alexandria, LA and forecast in a tropical weather market. This is where he got to forecast and see Hurricane Laura.  Laura was a category 4 hurricane (only 2 mph wind speeds away from being a category 5). He got well versed in tropical forecasting over his 5 year span in the Bayou State. This is also where he received his NWA Seal of Approval from the National Weather Association. \n\nBarrett was born and raised in Arkansas, the Natural State. He naturally loves the outdoors, especially anything to do at the lake. On weekends you can find him hanging out with friends or at the gym. He has already noticed the friendliness of people in Southwest Oklahoma and is very happy to be back where it all began in the Sooner State!","slug":"barrett-phillips","instagram":"@barrett_wx","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"middleName":"Lee","suffix":"Mr.","last_updated_date":"2024-04-22T20:38:22.309Z","custom_gray_stationname":"kswo","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2","location":"Lawton,
