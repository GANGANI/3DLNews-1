I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read. I am extremely happy to have my first reporting job in Bismarck and having the honor and privilege of telling your stories. If you see me out in the community, please do not hesitate to stop and say hello. \n\nConnect with Me!\n\nEmail: Justin.Gick@kfyrtv.com\nTwitter/Instagram: @JGickTV\nFacebook: Justin Gick TV","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kfyr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-02-14T16:01:00.306Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:46:39.626Z","description":{"basic":"He said this is the first time a U.S. President, former President, or presidential candidate has been convicted of a felony."},"headlines":{"basic":"What is the impact of the Trump verdict on the country?

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school.

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there.

She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling.

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:
