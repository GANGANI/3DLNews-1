But no assignment has ever made him happier than coming home to the city where he was born and working at the station he grew up watching.\n\nIt took David a long time to find his way back to Louisville. For 23 years he had a front-row seat to history as a CNN National Correspondent reporting on many of the most important and most talked about news stories of our time:\n\nThe Sept. 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, Virginia Tech shootings, Columbine and Aurora, the Scott Peterson trial, Gore vs. Bush, the Space Shuttle Columbia crash, the BP Gulf oil spill, the Casey Anthony trial, the Boston Marathon bombings, ebola, Mississippi floods, the D.C. sniper, the Miracle on the Hudson, the Ferguson riots and more.\n\nIn addition to countless newsmakers and celebrities, David has interviewed, covered or met every U.S. President from Gerald Ford to Donald Trump. He has earned a reputation as a challenging interviewer as well as a provocative and compelling storyteller. David is known for his signature \"in-the-moment\" style of reporting that draws on moments of unguarded spontaneity.\n\nPrior to CNN, David was an award-winning anchor, reporter and documentary producer at WVTM, the NBC affiliate in Birmingham, Ala., where he worked for 10 years and developed one of the country's first environmental reporting franchises, a groundbreaking series called \"EarthSave.\"\n\nDavid was inspired to become a journalist by the Watergate scandal and the work of Washington Post correspondents Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\n\n\"They deeply influenced my view of the profession and the need for journalists who are not afraid to ask hard questions,\" David says. \"I look for any opportunity to instill that same sense of purpose in new generations who are curious about the world around them and eager to make it better.\"\n\nSo far, David's travels have taken him more than a million miles, to all 50 states and more than 20 countries. His work for CNN has been featured by filmmakers in internationally released movies and by nationally syndicated programs, including Oprah and the Barbara Walters Special.\n\nDavid is committed to mentoring young reporters and is a popular speaker at journalism schools, including his alma mater, the University of Alabama.","org":"WAVE","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"slug":"david-mattingly","source":{"source_id":"59802"},"status":true,"twitter":"MattinglyWAVE3","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2023-06-22T15:10:11.956Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wave","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","role":"Reporter","custom_gray_displaypriority":"11"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:41:58.652Z","description":{"basic":"In

Catch him forecasting the weather each weeknight on WAVE News at 7:00 & 7:30 p.m.\n\nRyan's career in weather started at a very young age when he started a website dedicated to forecasting Louisville's weather while still at duPont Manual High School. The website's success gave him the opportunity to join a storm chasing tour company in the Great Plains as a tour guide and web developer. This experience earned Ryan a major head start in severe weather forecasting and many great stories to tell. \n\nA graduate of Mississippi State University, Ryan holds a bachelor's degree in geosciences with an emphasis in professional and broadcast meteorology. During his college years he earned numerous accolades for his work in broadcasting and meteorology, including the National Weather Association's Broadcast Meteorology Scholarship. He was also the weekend morning weather forecaster at WBBJ, the ABC/CBS affiliate in Jackson, TN. \n\nRyan is no stranger to WAVE News, having interned at the station and shadowed Kevin Harned over the years. Ryan says coming back to WAVE News is a \"dream come true\" after a childhood filled with memories of the active weather that rolls through WAVE Country.\n\nIn his spare time, you'll find Ryan enjoying concerts, trying new food, running, and dabbling in photography. He's also a self-proclaimed technology geek who loves to try out new gadgets and interact frequently on social media.","org":"WAVE","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Meteorologist","slug":"ryan-hoke","source":{"source_id":"43037"},"status":true,"twitter":"RyanHokeWAVE3","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2022-08-12T20:46:19.379Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wave","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T03:31:50.772Z","description":{"basic":"Skies will clear early this evening with temperatures once again cooling down."},"headlines":{"basic":"FORECAST: Saturday storm chances rising, but it’s not a weekend washout","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/51wMZUaFTzFYvvgdp5PyaWOKMB8=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY.JPG","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"LouisvilleSkyline-WinterSunset.JPG","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY.JPG","owner":"charles.gazaway@wave3.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/51wMZUaFTzFYvvgdp5PyaWOKMB8=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY.JPG","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/51wMZUaFTzFYvvgdp5PyaWOKMB8=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY.JPG","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/ALi8Zg5UspiwV1k_5QgNsC__60M=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/V3YHTC4BJFCKRARNIQCC5YFFQY.JPG","usage_instructions":"WAVE News photo.

Fearing my parents would be deported, as a child, I turned to news broadcasting to keep me updated on the immigration and deportation climate. It was then that I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up: a reporter.\nYears later, I am fulfilling that dream.\nPrior to joining the FOX19 NOW team, I worked as a multimedia journalist for CAN-TV Chicago. My work primarily focused on covering underserved communities in the city’s south side. Because of this work, I was given the opportunity to act as a national correspondent and travel to the border city of El Paso, Texas to cover the migrant crisis following the expiration of Title 42.\nIn addition to that work, I also produced two short-form documentaries. My first documentary titled, “The Perilous Journey To The American Dream” was published by the Illinois Latino News Network and later played in a Chicago theater.

As of late, teams and organizations across all sports have kind of taken a step toward acknowledging it, doing something about it, and talking about it. For my family’s sake, we lost my brother, Will, in 2010. It was almost 14 years ago now, and he was 15, a freshman in high school, an athlete, a musician, he had a bunch of friends. We thought things were going great, and we didn’t know anything was wrong. It was kind of a shock for a lot of us. My dad said, pretty much immediately, said we’ve got to do something about this. We have to use this to help, and he’s been amazing in turning this tragedy into something we can help others with. That was the point of the Will to Live foundation. We started it weeks after my brother’s death. We’ve made it our job to help people out and get people talking about mental health and suicide and depression and anxiety, especially in teens.”"},{"_id":"LUW7FGNK75FZNBNFRN3B5JZLNE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717035097114,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"”Talk to me a little bit about your brother and your connection with your brother,” said Baker. “He was your older brother.”"},{"_id":"PGAIA7DBEVCVTNP4TFZDDFY7TM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717035097115,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"”Like any 10-year-old kid, he was my hero,” said Trautwein. “I am a catcher now and he was a catcher.

It hurt to lose him, and he was someone I looked up to, and he was the oldest brother. We have a saying called Love Ya Man and it is our motto.
