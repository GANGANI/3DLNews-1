I attended Roanoke College and Mississippi State University where I received a master’s degree in meteorology. Shortly before I graduated in 2011, I had a first-account experience in the aftermath of the April 27 Super Outlook. Seeing the human side of that devastating tornado event just solidified my desire to be a meteorologist. My life as a broadcast meteorologist has taken me to Mississippi, Texas, and Pennsylvania. I have covered many severe weather events, but one of my most memorable was the “Christmas Day snowstorm” of 2017 that buried Erie, PA in nearly 4 feet of snow in just 2 days. Talk about dreaming of a White Christmas?\n\nWhen I am not forecasting the weather, I am grilling out, hiking, reading or chasing around my daughter Lainey.\n\nI look forward to seeing all the sights, eating all the food, and sipping on some local brews.\n\nAnd yes, I once played comedian Tom Segura in a charity basketball game.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","custom_gray_stationname":"wbko","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-05-11T09:29:40.812Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:55:06.942Z","description":{"basic":"Friday

As a kid, she feared severe weather and would actively watch on-air meteorologists to stay informed. \n\nThe comfort it brought her was what inspired her to one day do the same for others. She became fascinated by all things meteorology and would study it with her dad as a kid during their free time. \n\nShe was awarded several times through her undergraduate career for her skills in research and coding. The summer of her sophomore year she was selected for a competitive and rigorous internship at The National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. There, she got to study and deepen her meteorological knowledge under the mentorship of other brilliant meteorologists on an everyday basis for the entire summer. \n\nWhile she loved her time in the academic environment, she was most passionate about broadcasting meteorology. \n\nShe interned at WKRN News 2 in Nashville and at WBKO during her junior and senior years and decided that broadcasting meteorology was where she thrived the most. \n\nWhen she's not working, Raquel enjoys painting, cooking new recipes, and playing with her cat who she named Stormy. \nShe looks forward to spending more time in the South Central Kentucky community!

I attended Roanoke College and Mississippi State University where I received a master’s degree in meteorology. Shortly before I graduated in 2011, I had a first-account experience in the aftermath of the April 27 Super Outlook. Seeing the human side of that devastating tornado event just solidified my desire to be a meteorologist. My life as a broadcast meteorologist has taken me to Mississippi, Texas, and Pennsylvania. I have covered many severe weather events, but one of my most memorable was the “Christmas Day snowstorm” of 2017 that buried Erie, PA in nearly 4 feet of snow in just 2 days. Talk about dreaming of a White Christmas?\n\nWhen I am not forecasting the weather, I am grilling out, hiking, reading or chasing around my daughter Lainey.\n\nI look forward to seeing all the sights, eating all the food, and sipping on some local brews.\n\nAnd yes, I once played comedian Tom Segura in a charity basketball game.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","custom_gray_stationname":"wbko","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-05-11T09:29:40.812Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T21:46:12.785Z","description":{"basic":"A

As a kid, she feared severe weather and would actively watch on-air meteorologists to stay informed. \n\nThe comfort it brought her was what inspired her to one day do the same for others. She became fascinated by all things meteorology and would study it with her dad as a kid during their free time. \n\nShe was awarded several times through her undergraduate career for her skills in research and coding. The summer of her sophomore year she was selected for a competitive and rigorous internship at The National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. There, she got to study and deepen her meteorological knowledge under the mentorship of other brilliant meteorologists on an everyday basis for the entire summer. \n\nWhile she loved her time in the academic environment, she was most passionate about broadcasting meteorology. \n\nShe interned at WKRN News 2 in Nashville and at WBKO during her junior and senior years and decided that broadcasting meteorology was where she thrived the most. \n\nWhen she's not working, Raquel enjoys painting, cooking new recipes, and playing with her cat who she named Stormy. \nShe looks forward to spending more time in the South Central Kentucky community!
