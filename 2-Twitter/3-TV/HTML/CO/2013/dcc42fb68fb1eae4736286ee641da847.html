After working behind the scenes her entire career, she moved in front of the camera in 2022 to cover the happy stories for the Pikes Peak region.  You can catch her \"Good News\" reports every Friday during the 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. shows!\n\nLindsey grew up in San Antonio, Texas (Go Spurs Go!) and ran cross country for Baylor University.  She remains an avid runner and is taking full advantage of Colorado's amazing trails and NOT having to run in 100+ degree heat!  When not working or running, Lindsey loves reading, yoga, movie nights with friends, and learning the most random and useless history facts that she can bore people with!\n\nAmong her proudest career accomplishments are receiving the Colorado Broadcasters Association award for Best Website in 2014 and second place in 2017 for her work on a webpage commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Waldo Canyon Fire. In 2019, she was a co-recipient of the national TVNewsCheck Social Media Excellence award, small/medium markets, for the station's work on Facebook.\n\nIf you have a story you want to see featured on Good News Friday, a comment on a web article, or a cute animal photo, just email Lindsey at lgrewe@kktv.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-05-17T19:15:22.633Z","role":"Digital Content Writer/Good News Friday Reporter","custom_gray_displaypriority":"18","custom_gray_stationname":"kktv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T11:48:42.605Z","description":{"basic":"When they drove through the Air Force Academy gates for the first time as incoming freshman, the world was at the start of a global pandemic.
