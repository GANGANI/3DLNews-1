The Buccaneers wasted no time tonight jumping out to an early lead as the 2nd batter of the game Cade Climie hit a 2-run bomb to give Blinn an early 2-0 lead. Later in the inning, Tony Vernars doubled the Blinn lead with a 2 RBI single to left. The first inning was capped off by leadoff hitter Tanner Reaves driving in 2 more runs to give the Buccaneers a 6-0 as they bats around in the first inning. The ball clubs traded 2 run innings in the 2nd to leave the score at 8-2 heading into the top of the 3rd. In the 3rd the Stingers proved once again that they will never quit as they erupted for 5 runs to narrow the Blinn lead to 8-7. In the bottom half of the 3rd, the Buccaneers posted two more runs punctuated by Caden Ferraro hitting his 2nd home run of the night. The team added 3 more runs in the 4th to give them a commanding 13-7 needing just four more runs to run rule the Stingers. Starting pitcher Brandon Sweeney put up a 0 in the top of the 5th to set the table for Blinn to walk it off on Day 4. Cade Climie, Brandon Bishop, and Coy DeFury all drove in a run to set the table for Ethan Gonzalez to hit a monster walk-off homerun on his 19th birthday as the Buccaneers reamed undefeated taking down the Stinger 17-7 in 5 innings."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"JefferyHinkle","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Jeffrey Hinkle","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/da2377be-81ec-447f-ae54-535e27c55259.JPG","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv"},{"site":"twitter","url":"@JeffreyHinkle_"},{"site":"instagram","url":"@_jeffreyhinkle_"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"twitter","url":"@JeffreyHinkle_","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"instagram","url":"@_jeffreyhinkle_","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"JefferyHinkle","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Hinkle","byline":"Jeffrey Hinkle","role":"Multimedia Journalist","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/da2377be-81ec-447f-ae54-535e27c55259.JPG","email":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.","longBio":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.
