But the real story of this game was the insane comeback from the Stingers throughout the game. Down 18-9 in the seventh, the Stingers had a chance to take the lead in the eighth inning, trailing just 18-16. Thanks to a 3-run home run from Devin Mitchell, the Stingers jumped in front 19-18 heading into the ninth.

He says you can probably guess his mood on any given day based solely on how one of his favorite teams did that day.\n\nOutside of sports Garrett loves live music, traveling, and cooking. \n\nGarrett says he would appreciate anyone reaching out with story ideas, or to complain about your fantasy football team, so long as you’re ready to hear how bad his team is as well.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","custom_gray_stationname":"kjct","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"sports","last_updated_date":"2024-04-03T22:24:13.543Z"}}},{"_id":"(JefferyHinkle)","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Jeffrey Hinkle","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/dea0da35-2714-474b-880f-f032032f3fba.JPG","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv"},{"site":"twitter","url":"@JeffreyHinkle_"},{"site":"instagram","url":"@_jeffreyhinkle_"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"twitter","url":"@JeffreyHinkle_","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"instagram","url":"@_jeffreyhinkle_","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"(JefferyHinkle)","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Hinkle","byline":"(Jeffrey Hinkle)","role":"Multimedia Journalist","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/dea0da35-2714-474b-880f-f032032f3fba.JPG","email":"kkco-newsroom@gray.tv","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.","longBio":"Jeffrey is originally from Southern California, but he spent some time in Phoenix, Arizona where he graduated from Arizona State University in December of 2023 with his BA in Sports Journalism.
