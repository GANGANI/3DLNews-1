She joined the WCAX-TV news team as the weekday morning news producer shortly after that in July 2011. During that time, in addition to her producing responsibilities, she was a reporter and fill-in anchor.\n\nWhen the station announced in the summer of 2013 that it was launching a new weekend morning news broadcast, Cat jumped at the opportunity to create a show from scratch and was promoted to its producer/reporter. \"The Weekend\" debuted in September 2013. Cat split her time between hard news and features in the \"At Issue\" and \"Destination Recreation\" segments, as well as enterprising her weekly \"Sunday Science\" series.\n\nIn 2016, Cat moved to full-time reporting for the evening news, focusing on covering the news of the day, while also maintaining her interest in science news. In spring 2017, she accepted a promotion to evening news executive producer. In spring 2018, she went back to her first love, reporting.\n\nWhen the station announced the creation of the 4:00 afternoon broadcast in September 2020, Cat was promoted to anchor and reporter for that newscast. A year later, in fall 2021, she was promoted to evening news co-anchor, joining longtime colleague and friend Darren Perron on the anchor desk.\n\nWhen she isn't working, Cat can be found working out, social dancing, learning Spanish and baking. She is also a passionate chocoholic. And yes, her favorite animal is... a cat. She has three now -- Inky, Smudge and Yam, who like going for walks.\n\nPlease email any news tips or story ideas to
