&ldquo;There are no words to explain the horror and tragedy that has occurred in Orlando. Today, the entire world stands with the victims and their families. I offer my condolences to them during this terrible time and honor the brave first responders who risked their lives to save others. <br />

&ldquo;While we do not have all the facts yet, one thing is clear: This was a senseless, hateful attack on innocent people, and we must do everything possible to ensure that justice is done. That this act of hate occurred at an LGBT mainstay during LGBT Pride Month makes it all the more horrific. Hatred, terror and bigotry have no place in our country, and we will not allow our nation to be ruled by fear.&rdquo;<br />
