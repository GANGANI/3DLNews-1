While studying for his undergraduate, he interned for Arizona PBS and Cronkite News. During both his internships, he was a broadcast borderlands reporter and focused on covering border-related stories in both Washington D.C., and Arizona.</p><br>\n<p>After graduation, Alex left the Valley of the Sun and headed to Texas. Alex was the Midland Bureau Reporter at our sister station CBS7 News in Odessa, Texas. While reporting in the Permian Basin his stories not only had a local impact but also national, when covering the mass shooting that happened in the area.</p>\n<p>Alex continued reporting on stories important to the West Texas communities as a multimedia journalist for The Connect Network T.V. a lifestyle show that aired in Midland, Odessa, and Austin, Texas. He focused on stories relating to the pandemic, specifically how Texans came together and helped each other with the then-new virus.</p><br>\n<p>Alex moved to Southeast Alabama and joined the WDHN news team as a reporter and producer in March of 2021. During his time working and living in Dothan, Ala, some of his favorite stories he covered included City Commission, the coronavirus, and severe weather storms.</p><br>\n<p>In his free time, Alex likes to spend time with his two fur babies, Oliver and León.

Air Quality has issued an Ozone High Pollution Advisory for Pinal County including Apache Junction, Casa Grande, Coolidge, and Florence for today.  This means that forecast weather conditions combined with existing ozone levels are expected to result in local maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations that pose a health risk. Adverse health effects increase as air quality deteriorates.  Ozone is an air contaminant which can cause breathing difficulties for children, older adults, as well as persons with respiratory problems. A decrease in physical activity is recommended.  You are urged to car pool, telecommute or use mass transit. The use of gasoline-powered equipment should be reduced or done late in the day.
