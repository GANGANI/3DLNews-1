motto of The Observer, the daily student newspaper at the University of Notre Dame, and the guiding principle I’ve followed since my first experience in journalism there.\nHometown: Tampa, Fla.\nEducation: University of Notre Dame (go Irish!)\nHobbies & Interests: I’m always in the middle of a book, likely searching for a new TV show to watch, and trying to keep up with my dog, a beagle

Candy Kitchen on Market Street\nMost interesting assignment: The 2020 Iowa caucuses and everything that led up to them — and followed them — were an adventure and a half.

As a teenager my passion for journalism was put into practice first by The White Lake Beacon, my hometown newspaper, which gave me real-world reporting experience while still in high school. I began working in broadcast television while attending school at the University of Missouri for their NBC station, KOMU 8 News, as a reporter and occasionally as a fill-in-anchor. I then moved to Grand Rapids, MI where I worked for my hometown station, WOOD-TV8 ,as an assignment desk editor, reporter and finally filling in as both a news anchor and traffic anchor. After several years working in west Michigan, I packed up and moved south to central Indiana for FOX59 & CBS4 in Indianapolis where I worked first as a reporter before being promoted to traffic anchor on the CBS4 This Morning show. \n\nProfessional Awards: 2021 Edward R. Murrow Award for Breaking News Coverage of the Grand Rapids, MI Riots; Nominated for two regional Emmys from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences from the Michigan and Great Lakes Chapters respectively for both breaking news coverage and business/consumer reporting; Achieved the rank of Eagle Scout after more than 12 years of service in the Boy Scouts of America. \nNews Philosophy: Truth above all else, followed by community. I am here to serve you. \n\nHometown: Muskegon, MI, along the beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline. \n\nEducation: Attended the number one journalism school in the nation, The University of Missouri School of Journalism where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Broadcast Journalism with an American History minor in 2018.\n\nFamily: My family is all living in west Michigan. They're excited to have a guest bedroom to crash at in a bona fide \"Spring Break destination.\"\n\nHobbies & Interests: When I'm not working, you can likely find me at the beach either walking, fishing or metal detecting with my lovely wife. That, or working on our pop-up trailer, barking while watching my Cleveland Browns, going for a run or trying out a new restaurant. Be sure to say hello if you see me, I'd love to meet you!\n\nFavorite Books: The Journals of Lewis and Clark, The Oregon Trail: A New American Journey, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle, The Killer Angels, Battle Cry of Freedom, The Things They Carried, Half American, A Civil War Road Trip of a Lifetime\n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The food, the beach, the weather and the people!\n\nMost interesting assignment: I always tell my friends and family that as a journalist, we meet folks on their best days, their worst days or some other in between; therefore my most interesting assignments are a double-edged sword. I have had the great honor to walk alongside families rebuilding after great catastrophe caused both by God and man. I have also had the great privilege to be with folks celebrating championships, lottery winnings and personal achievements of all kinds... keeping this in mind, my favorite story would have to be an expose I worked on with a player from Indianapolis on the 2022 National Championship Runners Up Alabama Crimson Tide. I spoke with his high school teammates, high school coaches, friends and family on how excited they were to see him play in the upcoming CFB National Championship in his hometown, I was even able to interview him before kickoff.

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T23:31:28.854Z","description":{"basic":"The

I interned at WXII 12 News in my hometown.  \n\nNews Philosophy: Listen and look into it.  I love stories and I also love facts.  Journalism is an essential combination of the two where I get to hear what matters to people, tell their stories and work to answer their questions. \n\nEducation: I have a degree in Broadcast Journalism from the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at UNC Chapel Hill.  I also graduated with a minor in anthropology.  \n\nHometown: Winston-Salem, NC.  \n\nFamily: I have one younger brother and am very close with my parents.  I am so happy to be close enough for frequent visits.  \n\nHobbies & Interests: I love to read, especially on the beach or at the pool.  I enjoy live music and good food.  I love watching UNC sports, especially football and basketball.  \n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I am a huge Taylor Swift fan and listen to a lot of news and pop culture related podcasts on my way to interviews and reports.  I read a lot, so it's hard to pick a favorite book, but Lianne Moriarty is my favorite author.   \n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry:  I chose to move to Charleston specifically because I love being by the water.  Eating a meal with a view, taking a boat ride and driving over scenic bridges are everyday things I appreciate about Charleston.  \n\nMost Interesting Assignment: I have a passion for breaking news and being the one who can get answers for people in a time that's often confusing or overwhelming.  On June 24th, 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, I drove to Columbia to report on reactions and next steps in the SC legislature.  It was a very cool feeling to be one of many reporting that day on the topic of national impact.  I liked being able to explain what the day meant for South Carolinians and answer their questions moving forward. \n","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter

I also think that it is extremely important to prioritize accountability in journalism and provide the public with a voice to be heard.\n\nHometown: Goose Creek, South Carolina\n\nEducation: I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor’s Degree in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Political Science.\n\nFamily: My relatives are all spread out along the East Coast. I am very grateful to have my loved ones cheering me on as I begin this new chapter!\n\nHobbies/Interests: I am an equestrian of 15 years and a former competitive swimmer. I love to cook, dance, be out in nature, and I have recently gotten into thrifting and vintage-inspired fashion!\n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I like a little bit of everything when it comes to music, and I am always looking to discover new tunes! If I had to pick three artists, my favorites would be Fleetwood Mac, The 1975 and Harry Styles. My favorite movie is Little Women and my favorite book series is The Hunger Games.\n\nLikes best about the Lowcountry: My favorite part of this area has always been the community aspect. The Lowcountry is full of lovely people with amazing stories to tell! I feel honored to get to tell them, and I am excited to get to know this city on a deeper level.\n\nMost interesting assignment: While working for the digital team at WACH FOX 57 in Columbia, I field produced a story on Benedict College’s Annual Anti-Gun Violence Walk. The event brings community members and law enforcement together to honor the lives lost to gun violence and advocate for safer gun legislation in the state of South Carolina. After documenting the march, I sat down with several students, faculty and other community members who directly experienced situations connected to gun violence or knew loved ones who have been affected. Being able to engage in such moving conversations and see people come together to bring change in their communities was very transformative for my journalistic experience.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-08-16T15:21:40.775Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/caitlinashbaughlive5news","custom_gray_stationname":"wcsc"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:21:05.231Z","description":{"basic":"South

Throughout my college career I spent time trying out many different news positions in the UATV student-run newsroom and served as Assistant News Director. I also interned for Sport&Story - a sports media production company.\n\nNews Philosophy: My goal in the news industry is to bring awareness to what's important to my community with honesty and integrity - always. I want to connect with people and share their stories and be someone they can trust, while always maintaining the facts. Everyone deserves the platform to share what they believe matters. \n\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcast Journalism; Bachelor of Science in Human and Environmental Sciences in Apparel Merchandising and Product Development\n\nHometown: Lake Frederick, VA \n\nFamily: I am extremely close to my family. They mean everything to me. They are my biggest supporters and I am so thankful to have them. My mom, Wendy, my dad, Stephen, and my sister, Amber, all still live in the northeast. I wouldn't be here without them.  \n\nHobbies & Interests: I love to sew and design clothing. Styling, design and fashion are some of my favorite things. I love to shop. I also love being creative - anything from painting to interior decorating to makeup to creative writing - I just love to express myself in other ways. In my free time I love to exercise and explore new places. I am a big foodie and love to travel! I have had the opportunity to visit over 13 different countries and plan to see many more.  \n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: My absolute favorite book is The Notebook. I love a variety of music but am a huge Swiftie. Movies are so hard to pick a favorite, but I love a thrill - action and scary movies are my go-to. \n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: Being close to the beach and the amazing food options!","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wcsc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-02-29T18:21:17.465Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/autumnkleinlive5"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T10:36:19.737Z","description":{"basic":"Doctors

Having the passion to do all three is what makes a really good news reporter.\n\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts in Journalism with a double minor in Criminal Justice and Strategic Communication from High Point University.\n\nHometown: Davidson, N.C.\n\nFamily: My parents, Jeff and Gina, and younger brother, John, all reside in Davidson, N.C.

The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides and Verity by Colleen Hoover are two of the best books. I am also a die-hard Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and Shania Twain fan. The song, “Fireball” by Pitbull is just an added bonus.\n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: Charleston, S.C. has always been one of my favorite cities to visit and I could not be more excited to move here. The charm, class and food are incomparable to anywhere else.\n\nMost Interesting Assignment: During my sophomore year at HPU, I created a podcast for one of my classes about squatters in my hometown. Squatters had invaded the mayor of Davidson’s parents’ home when it was vacant and they refused to leave. I interviewed the mayor and a local real estate agent about their perspectives and it kick-started my passion for investigative journalism.

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

I also think that it is extremely important to prioritize accountability in journalism and provide the public with a voice to be heard.\n\nHometown: Goose Creek, South Carolina\n\nEducation: I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor’s Degree in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Political Science.\n\nFamily: My relatives are all spread out along the East Coast. I am very grateful to have my loved ones cheering me on as I begin this new chapter!\n\nHobbies/Interests: I am an equestrian of 15 years and a former competitive swimmer. I love to cook, dance, be out in nature, and I have recently gotten into thrifting and vintage-inspired fashion!\n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I like a little bit of everything when it comes to music, and I am always looking to discover new tunes! If I had to pick three artists, my favorites would be Fleetwood Mac, The 1975 and Harry Styles. My favorite movie is Little Women and my favorite book series is The Hunger Games.\n\nLikes best about the Lowcountry: My favorite part of this area has always been the community aspect. The Lowcountry is full of lovely people with amazing stories to tell! I feel honored to get to tell them, and I am excited to get to know this city on a deeper level.\n\nMost interesting assignment: While working for the digital team at WACH FOX 57 in Columbia, I field produced a story on Benedict College’s Annual Anti-Gun Violence Walk. The event brings community members and law enforcement together to honor the lives lost to gun violence and advocate for safer gun legislation in the state of South Carolina. After documenting the march, I sat down with several students, faculty and other community members who directly experienced situations connected to gun violence or knew loved ones who have been affected. Being able to engage in such moving conversations and see people come together to bring change in their communities was very transformative for my journalistic experience.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-08-16T15:21:40.775Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/caitlinashbaughlive5news","custom_gray_stationname":"wcsc"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:13:03.477Z","description":{"basic":"Several families in a North Charleston neighborhood are recovering after their homes were flooded with what appears to be sewage from a nearby drain pipe."},"headlines":{"basic":"‘My kids don’t deserve to live this way’: Tenants angry after sewage floods N.

WRNN-TV(Rye Brook, NY) Producer \nNews Philosophy: Information can be more powerful than anything else in this world and no one understands that better than the journalists who pursue it every day. We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

I interned at WXII 12 News in my hometown.  \n\nNews Philosophy: Listen and look into it.  I love stories and I also love facts.  Journalism is an essential combination of the two where I get to hear what matters to people, tell their stories and work to answer their questions. \n\nEducation: I have a degree in Broadcast Journalism from the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at UNC Chapel Hill.  I also graduated with a minor in anthropology.  \n\nHometown: Winston-Salem, NC.  \n\nFamily: I have one younger brother and am very close with my parents.  I am so happy to be close enough for frequent visits.  \n\nHobbies & Interests: I love to read, especially on the beach or at the pool.  I enjoy live music and good food.  I love watching UNC sports, especially football and basketball.  \n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I am a huge Taylor Swift fan and listen to a lot of news and pop culture related podcasts on my way to interviews and reports.  I read a lot, so it's hard to pick a favorite book, but Lianne Moriarty is my favorite author.   \n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry:  I chose to move to Charleston specifically because I love being by the water.  Eating a meal with a view, taking a boat ride and driving over scenic bridges are everyday things I appreciate about Charleston.  \n\nMost Interesting Assignment: I have a passion for breaking news and being the one who can get answers for people in a time that's often confusing or overwhelming.  On June 24th, 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, I drove to Columbia to report on reactions and next steps in the SC legislature.  It was a very cool feeling to be one of many reporting that day on the topic of national impact.  I liked being able to explain what the day meant for South Carolinians and answer their questions moving forward. \n","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter

","longBio":"Autumn joined the Live 5 News team in October 2023. \n\nProfessional Experience: I joined the Live 5 News team as my first market after college. Throughout my college career I spent time trying out many different news positions in the UATV student-run newsroom and served as Assistant News Director. I also interned for Sport&Story - a sports media production company.\n\nNews Philosophy: My goal in the news industry is to bring awareness to what's important to my community with honesty and integrity - always. I want to connect with people and share their stories and be someone they can trust, while always maintaining the facts. Everyone deserves the platform to share what they believe matters. \n\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcast Journalism; Bachelor of Science in Human and Environmental Sciences in Apparel Merchandising and Product Development\n\nHometown: Lake Frederick, VA \n\nFamily: I am extremely close to my family. They mean everything to me. They are my biggest supporters and I am so thankful to have them. My mom, Wendy, my dad, Stephen, and my sister, Amber, all still live in the northeast. I wouldn't be here without them.  \n\nHobbies & Interests: I love to sew and design clothing. Styling, design and fashion are some of my favorite things. I love to shop. I also love being creative - anything from painting to interior decorating to makeup to creative writing - I just love to express myself in other ways. In my free time I love to exercise and explore new places. I am a big foodie and love to travel!
