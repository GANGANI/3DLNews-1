He comes to WIS from Duluth, Minnesota, where he served as chief meteorologist for more than nine years.\n\nBefore that, he was chief meteorologist in Bend, Oregon, weekend meteorologist in Augusta, Georgia and a news producer in Columbus, Mississippi.\n\nAdam knows the Midlands very well; he met his wife while in undergraduate school at the UofSC’s Journalism program. He then went on to earn his master’s degree in geoscience/broadcast meteorology at Mississippi State University in Starkville.\n\nAdam is a member of the American Meteorological Society and holds their Television Seal of Approval. While in Duluth, he and his team earned two Emmys for covering an oil refinery fire by using radar to track the toxic cloud’s height and placement.\n\nAdam is thrilled to be back in Columbia to cheer on his beloved Gamecocks. He played the saxophone in the Carolina Band, and got his start in broadcasting at WUSC-FM hosting a big band/swing show (DJ name: Big Daddy Clark). Adam loves to grill and smoke meat, he also has a 1955 Buick Century that he is very slowly restoring. He and his wife Valerie, along with their border collie-mix Daisy, enjoy hiking/walking the many river walks Columbia has to offer.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Chief

WRNN-TV(Rye Brook, NY) Producer \nNews Philosophy: Information can be more powerful than anything else in this world and no one understands that better than the journalists who pursue it every day. We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

Having the passion to do all three is what makes a really good news reporter.\n\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts in Journalism with a double minor in Criminal Justice and Strategic Communication from High Point University.\n\nHometown: Davidson, N.C.\n\nFamily: My parents, Jeff and Gina, and younger brother, John, all reside in Davidson, N.C. All of my extended family is from the Lake Norman area, where I grew up all my life!\n\nHobbies & Interests: When I’m not making anything and everything about journalism, I enjoy taking dance classes (especially tap), reading and hanging out with my friends and family.\n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I absolutely love any mystery or thriller novel. The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides and Verity by Colleen Hoover are two of the best books. I am also a die-hard Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and Shania Twain fan. The song, “Fireball” by Pitbull is just an added bonus.\n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: Charleston, S.C. has always been one of my favorite cities to visit and I could not be more excited to move here. The charm, class and food are incomparable to anywhere else.\n\nMost Interesting Assignment: During my sophomore year at HPU, I created a podcast for one of my classes about squatters in my hometown. Squatters had invaded the mayor of Davidson’s parents’ home when it was vacant and they refused to leave. I interviewed the mayor and a local real estate agent about their perspectives and it kick-started my passion for investigative journalism. The story won “Best Broadcast Journalism Story” departmental award from the Nido R.

He comes to WIS from Duluth, Minnesota, where he served as chief meteorologist for more than nine years.\n\nBefore that, he was chief meteorologist in Bend, Oregon, weekend meteorologist in Augusta, Georgia and a news producer in Columbus, Mississippi.\n\nAdam knows the Midlands very well; he met his wife while in undergraduate school at the UofSC’s Journalism program. He then went on to earn his master’s degree in geoscience/broadcast meteorology at Mississippi State University in Starkville.\n\nAdam is a member of the American Meteorological Society and holds their Television Seal of Approval. While in Duluth, he and his team earned two Emmys for covering an oil refinery fire by using radar to track the toxic cloud’s height and placement.\n\nAdam is thrilled to be back in Columbia to cheer on his beloved Gamecocks. He played the saxophone in the Carolina Band, and got his start in broadcasting at WUSC-FM hosting a big band/swing show (DJ name: Big Daddy Clark). Adam loves to grill and smoke meat, he also has a 1955 Buick Century that he is very slowly restoring. He and his wife Valerie, along with their border collie-mix Daisy, enjoy hiking/walking the many river walks Columbia has to offer.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Chief

Intisar attended Missouri State University, where she obtained degrees in Broadcast Journalism & Political Science, as well as a Masters in Communications.\n\nIntisar got her start in news on radio as an anchor for KTTS News in Springfield, MO. During her time there, she won two Missouri Broadcasters Association Awards for “Best News Series” and “Breaking News Weather Coverage.”\n\nIn 2019 she joined the team at WTOK-TV in Meridian, MS as the anchor and executive producer for the station’s morning show, “Good Morning Meridian.” Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, she also became the producer and host of the station’s Sunday talk show “On The Record.” In early 2021, Intisar produced and anchored WTOK’s first ever Black History Month Special. The special earned 1st place for “Public Affairs Program” from the Mississippi Broadcasters Association.\n\nDuring her time in Columbia, Intisar has been nominated twice for Kiss 103.1’s “Columbia Neighborhood Awards” for ‘Best News Anchor.’ She also was honored with an award of Merit for the 2023 “Personality of the Year” by the South Carolina Broadcasters Association.\n\nBeyond her broadcasting achievements, Intisar is a co-founder of the ELEVATE Women’s Empowerment Brunch, a networking event geared towards young female professionals. She is also a member of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), and serves as the Publications Coordinator for Columbia fashion magazine, COLAFW Experience.\n\nIn her spare time, she loves to travel, watch movies, DIY craft projects, and explore new restaurants. The daughter of a Texan father and a Tanzanian mother, she says diverse cuisine was normal growing up. When it comes to food, the spicier, the better.\n\n
