You hear often that COVID-19 patients are treated in isolation, and while specific elements of COVID-19 isolation may differ from other infectious diseases, the fundamental practices for isolation treatment do not. Isolation is meant to prevent the spread of infectious diseases between patients and the staff members treating them, between patients and their visitors, and between patients and other patients, staff members, and visitors throughout the hospital.{/p}{p}{strong}Treating patients in isolation{/strong}{/p}{p}It&rsquo;s important to note that many patients are treated using various isolation practices, for everything from pink eye to COVID-19. Isolation practices vary based on how a specific infectious disease is spread.{/p}{ul}{li}If the disease is primarily spread through physical contact, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through direct or indirect contact, which would include things like wearing gloves or a gown.{/li}{/ul}{ul}{li}If the disease is spread through droplets of mucus or saliva, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through droplets, which would include things like wearing a mask when working closely with the patient.{/li}{/ul}{ul}{li}If the disease is spread through airborne particles that can be spread through inhalation, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through the air, which would include placing patients in rooms with monitored negative air pressure (to prevent spread through air circulation to other parts of the hospital) and wearing respiratory protection while in the room.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}Safety practices in isolation{/strong}{/p}{p}Fundamental safety practices for treating patients in isolation are consistent, though, no matter how the disease is spread, and these include:{/p}{ul}{li}{strong}Handwashing{/strong}: Handwashing is the bedrock of hospital safety and infection prevention. All staff members wash their hands or use a hand sanitizing solution upon entry and exit of the room, and even between treatments on the same patient when appropriate. Handwashing is done even if gloves are worn while in the room.{/li}{li}{strong}Patient placement and transport{/strong}: Patients in isolation are typically assigned to private rooms, and additional safety precautions are taken any time they are transported between departments or rooms.{/li}{li}{strong}Personal protective equipment{/strong}: Staff members and visitors entering isolation rooms wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The required PPE varies based on how the specific disease is spread, and in the case of COVID-19, typically includes a mask and gown.{/li}{li}{strong}Nutrition, environmental services, and more{/strong}: Staff members who deliver food or provide cleaning services follow strict guidelines and limit unnecessary entry to isolation rooms. These practices ensure patients still receive excellent care and service while limiting additional exposure and conserving PPE use.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}Universal Masking at Providence Health{/strong}{/p}{p}As a patient or visitor to the hospital or an outpatient clinic, you will be asked to wear a mask, and you will also notice that all of our staff members, in every department, are wearing masks, too. Universal masking is a proactive measure we&rsquo;re taking to significantly reduce the potential spread of illness. This, layered with our screening at each point of entry for all staff members, patients, and visitors, provides additional protection for everyone in our facilities.{/p}{p}{strong}How Providence Health is treating COVID-19 patients{/strong}{/p}{p}Out of an abundance of caution, we are taking a number of additional precautions in the treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19{/p}{ul}{li}All facilities are screening patients prior to their entry into the facility. Any patient presenting with a fever or other COVID-19 related symptom is isolated for further investigation.{/li}{li}We continue our zero visitor policy at all facilities &ndash; to protect our patients, their families, and our caregivers.{/li}{li}Specific units and staff are dedicated to the care of COVID-19 patients providing them with optimal attention and limiting any potential virus exposure to others in the hospital.{/li}{/ul}{p}These protective measures for managing infectious diseases ensure that our hospital is always safe for you and your loved ones when you need care.{/p}{p}For More Information Click Here: https://www.yourprovidencehealth.com/coronavirus-covid-19-preparedness-information{/p}{p}{strong}COLUMBIA VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM{/strong}{/p}{p}Location: 6439 Garners Ferry RD.

Graduation ceremonies will again be streamed live online. More specifics will be shared with seniors and parents by each school as details are confirmed.{/p}{p}It&rsquo;s more than fair to say that 2020 has posed significant challenges to this school year, especially for seniors. The global health pandemic caused by COVID-19 prompted the Colonial Life Arena, where the district has held graduation in recent years, to cancel all events through July 31. In April, the district assembled a task force to come up with multiple viable options for graduation ceremonies observing social distancing as well as alternatives to a traditional ceremony. Representatives from each high school including students as well as district administrators served on the task force.{/p}{p}Richland Two Superintendent Dr. Baron R. Davis said, &ldquo;I want to thank the task force for the hard work they have put in to make graduations possible for our seniors. They did a phenomenal job examining all the possibilities and providing a solid recommendation for a meaningful and safe way to honor our seniors.{/p}{p}&ldquo;As we finalize the logistics for the ceremonies, our focus remains on the safety and welfare of those who will attend. These graduation ceremonies will look very different from those in the past but they will certainly reflect the resiliency of the Class of 2020 and provide a meaningful tribute to our seniors.&rdquo;{/p}{p}Only invited guests of each senior will be permitted to attend these ceremonies. Each graduation will be streamed live on the Richland Two website at https://livestream.com/richland2.{/p}{p}{strong}FREE MEALS FOR CHILDREN 18 AND UNDER{/strong}{/p}{ul}{li}Monday-Friday at designated school sites and community sites{/li}{li}Locations on the website at www.richland2.org/freemeals{/li}{li}Starting this Friday, May 8, families will receive breakfasts & lunches for Saturday and Sunday in addition to the meals for Friday.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}PLANS FOR THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR{/strong}{/p}{p}A task force of school and district administrators met multiple days over the last few weeks to develop plans for closing out the school year. They came up with recommended procedures for the safe collection of school materials and the pick-up of personal items. Below is an overview of the plans for elementary, middle, and high schools. Each school's plans will vary somewhat and parents will receive those specific details from their student's school. At all schools, the school nurses will coordinate the return of student medication to parents.{/p}{p}{strong}ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS{/strong}{/p}{ul}{li}From June 1-3, parents will come to the schools on their assigned day, based on the student's last name, to pick up students&rsquo; personal belongings and drop off materials.

We have partnered with BrightBytes to gather this input through a brief survey.

We use DocuSign for signatures instead of passing pens around and communication beyond showing homes is done through phone & email.

You hear often that COVID-19 patients are treated in isolation, and while specific elements of COVID-19 isolation may differ from other infectious diseases, the fundamental practices for isolation treatment do not. Isolation is meant to prevent the spread of infectious diseases between patients and the staff members treating them, between patients and their visitors, and between patients and other patients, staff members, and visitors throughout the hospital.{/p}{p}{strong}Treating patients in isolation{/strong}{/p}{p}It&rsquo;s important to note that many patients are treated using various isolation practices, for everything from pink eye to COVID-19. Isolation practices vary based on how a specific infectious disease is spread.{/p}{ul}{li}If the disease is primarily spread through physical contact, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through direct or indirect contact, which would include things like wearing gloves or a gown.{/li}{/ul}{ul}{li}If the disease is spread through droplets of mucus or saliva, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through droplets, which would include things like wearing a mask when working closely with the patient.{/li}{/ul}{ul}{li}If the disease is spread through airborne particles that can be spread through inhalation, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through the air, which would include placing patients in rooms with monitored negative air pressure (to prevent spread through air circulation to other parts of the hospital) and wearing respiratory protection while in the room.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}Safety practices in isolation{/strong}{/p}{p}Fundamental safety practices for treating patients in isolation are consistent, though, no matter how the disease is spread, and these include:{/p}{ul}{li}{strong}Handwashing{/strong}: Handwashing is the bedrock of hospital safety and infection prevention. All staff members wash their hands or use a hand sanitizing solution upon entry and exit of the room, and even between treatments on the same patient when appropriate. Handwashing is done even if gloves are worn while in the room.{/li}{li}{strong}Patient placement and transport{/strong}: Patients in isolation are typically assigned to private rooms, and additional safety precautions are taken any time they are transported between departments or rooms.{/li}{li}{strong}Personal protective equipment{/strong}: Staff members and visitors entering isolation rooms wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The required PPE varies based on how the specific disease is spread, and in the case of COVID-19, typically includes a mask and gown.{/li}{li}{strong}Nutrition, environmental services, and more{/strong}: Staff members who deliver food or provide cleaning services follow strict guidelines and limit unnecessary entry to isolation rooms. These practices ensure patients still receive excellent care and service while limiting additional exposure and conserving PPE use.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}Universal Masking at Providence Health{/strong}{/p}{p}As a patient or visitor to the hospital or an outpatient clinic, you will be asked to wear a mask, and you will also notice that all of our staff members, in every department, are wearing masks, too. Universal masking is a proactive measure we&rsquo;re taking to significantly reduce the potential spread of illness. This, layered with our screening at each point of entry for all staff members, patients, and visitors, provides additional protection for everyone in our facilities.{/p}{p}{strong}How Providence Health is treating COVID-19 patients{/strong}{/p}{p}Out of an abundance of caution, we are taking a number of additional precautions in the treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19{/p}{ul}{li}All facilities are screening patients prior to their entry into the facility. Any patient presenting with a fever or other COVID-19 related symptom is isolated for further investigation.{/li}{li}We continue our zero visitor policy at all facilities &ndash; to protect our patients, their families, and our caregivers.{/li}{li}Specific units and staff are dedicated to the care of COVID-19 patients providing them with optimal attention and limiting any potential virus exposure to others in the hospital.{/li}{/ul}{p}These protective measures for managing infectious diseases ensure that our hospital is always safe for you and your loved ones when you need care.{/p}{p}For More Information Click Here: https://www.yourprovidencehealth.com/coronavirus-covid-19-preparedness-information{/p}{p}{strong}COLUMBIA VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM{/strong}{/p}{p}Location: 6439 Garners Ferry RD.

Graduation ceremonies will again be streamed live online. More specifics will be shared with seniors and parents by each school as details are confirmed.{/p}{p}It&rsquo;s more than fair to say that 2020 has posed significant challenges to this school year, especially for seniors. The global health pandemic caused by COVID-19 prompted the Colonial Life Arena, where the district has held graduation in recent years, to cancel all events through July 31. In April, the district assembled a task force to come up with multiple viable options for graduation ceremonies observing social distancing as well as alternatives to a traditional ceremony. Representatives from each high school including students as well as district administrators served on the task force.{/p}{p}Richland Two Superintendent Dr. Baron R. Davis said, &ldquo;I want to thank the task force for the hard work they have put in to make graduations possible for our seniors. They did a phenomenal job examining all the possibilities and providing a solid recommendation for a meaningful and safe way to honor our seniors.{/p}{p}&ldquo;As we finalize the logistics for the ceremonies, our focus remains on the safety and welfare of those who will attend. These graduation ceremonies will look very different from those in the past but they will certainly reflect the resiliency of the Class of 2020 and provide a meaningful tribute to our seniors.&rdquo;{/p}{p}Only invited guests of each senior will be permitted to attend these ceremonies. Each graduation will be streamed live on the Richland Two website at https://livestream.com/richland2.{/p}{p}{strong}FREE MEALS FOR CHILDREN 18 AND UNDER{/strong}{/p}{ul}{li}Monday-Friday at designated school sites and community sites{/li}{li}Locations on the website at www.richland2.org/freemeals{/li}{li}Starting this Friday, May 8, families will receive breakfasts & lunches for Saturday and Sunday in addition to the meals for Friday.{/li}{/ul}{p}{strong}PLANS FOR THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR{/strong}{/p}{p}A task force of school and district administrators met multiple days over the last few weeks to develop plans for closing out the school year. They came up with recommended procedures for the safe collection of school materials and the pick-up of personal items. Below is an overview of the plans for elementary, middle, and high schools. Each school's plans will vary somewhat and parents will receive those specific details from their student's school. At all schools, the school nurses will coordinate the return of student medication to parents.{/p}{p}{strong}ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS{/strong}{/p}{ul}{li}From June 1-3, parents will come to the schools on their assigned day, based on the student's last name, to pick up students&rsquo; personal belongings and drop off materials.

We have partnered with BrightBytes to gather this input through a brief survey.

We use DocuSign for signatures instead of passing pens around and communication beyond showing homes is done through phone & email.

You hear often that COVID-19 patients are treated in isolation, and while specific elements of COVID-19 isolation may differ from other infectious diseases, the fundamental practices for isolation treatment do not. Isolation is meant to prevent the spread of infectious diseases between patients and the staff members treating them, between patients and their visitors, and between patients and other patients, staff members, and visitors throughout the hospital.</p><p><strong>Treating patients in isolation</strong></p><p>It’s important to note that many patients are treated using various isolation practices, for everything from pink eye to COVID-19. Isolation practices vary based on how a specific infectious disease is spread.</p><ul><li>If the disease is primarily spread through physical contact, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through direct or indirect contact, which would include things like wearing gloves or a gown.</li></ul><ul><li>If the disease is spread through droplets of mucus or saliva, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through droplets, which would include things like wearing a mask when working closely with the patient.</li></ul><ul><li>If the disease is spread through airborne particles that can be spread through inhalation, staff members and visitors will follow guidelines specific to preventing spread through the air, which would include placing patients in rooms with monitored negative air pressure (to prevent spread through air circulation to other parts of the hospital) and wearing respiratory protection while in the room.</li></ul><p><strong>Safety practices in isolation</strong></p><p>Fundamental safety practices for treating patients in isolation are consistent, though, no matter how the disease is spread, and these include:</p><ul><li><strong>Handwashing</strong>: Handwashing is the bedrock of hospital safety and infection prevention. All staff members wash their hands or use a hand sanitizing solution upon entry and exit of the room, and even between treatments on the same patient when appropriate. Handwashing is done even if gloves are worn while in the room.</li><li><strong>Patient placement and transport</strong>: Patients in isolation are typically assigned to private rooms, and additional safety precautions are taken any time they are transported between departments or rooms.</li><li><strong>Personal protective equipment</strong>: Staff members and visitors entering isolation rooms wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The required PPE varies based on how the specific disease is spread, and in the case of COVID-19, typically includes a mask and gown.</li><li><strong>Nutrition, environmental services, and more</strong>: Staff members who deliver food or provide cleaning services follow strict guidelines and limit unnecessary entry to isolation rooms.

The district will hold graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2020 on June 1-5 at Harry Parone Stadium, located on the campus of Spring Valley High School at 120 Sparkleberry Lane.</p><p>Ceremonies will begin at 8 a.m. each day. The schedule is as follows:</p><ul><li>         June 1: Spring Valley</li><li>         June 2: Richland Northeast</li><li>         June 3: Blythewood</li><li>         June 4: Westwood</li><li>         June 5: Ridge View</li></ul><p>Social distancing practices will be observed, and each graduate will be permitted, two guests. Graduation ceremonies will again be streamed live online. More specifics will be shared with seniors and parents by each school as details are confirmed.</p><p>It’s more than fair to say that 2020 has posed significant challenges to this school year, especially for seniors. The global health pandemic caused by COVID-19 prompted the Colonial Life Arena, where the district has held graduation in recent years, to cancel all events through July 31. In April, the district assembled a task force to come up with multiple viable options for graduation ceremonies observing social distancing as well as alternatives to a traditional ceremony. Representatives from each high school including students as well as district administrators served on the task force.</p><p>Richland Two Superintendent Dr. Baron R. Davis said, “I want to thank the task force for the hard work they have put in to make graduations possible for our seniors. They did a phenomenal job examining all the possibilities and providing a solid recommendation for a meaningful and safe way to honor our seniors.</p><p>“As we finalize the logistics for the ceremonies, our focus remains on the safety and welfare of those who will attend. These graduation ceremonies will look very different from those in the past but they will certainly reflect the resiliency of the Class of 2020 and provide a meaningful tribute to our seniors.”</p><p>Only invited guests of each senior will be permitted to attend these ceremonies. Each graduation will be streamed live on the Richland Two website at https://livestream.com/richland2.</p><p><strong>FREE MEALS FOR CHILDREN 18 AND UNDER</strong></p><ul><li>Monday-Friday at designated school sites and community sites</li><li>Locations on the website at www.richland2.org/freemeals</li><li>Starting this Friday, May 8, families will receive breakfasts &amp; lunches for Saturday and Sunday in addition to the meals for Friday.</li></ul><p><strong>PLANS FOR THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR</strong></p><p>A task force of school and district administrators met multiple days over the last few weeks to develop plans for closing out the school year.

We would love to help you sell your occupied home after Covid-19 is under control but respect the safety of you and our community and will not be doing so for the time being. We ask that buyers meet us at properties instead of riding in our vehicles and will have gloves available while showing them. We also ask buyers to be mindful of the 6-foot distancing recommendations provided by the CDC during any time spent in person. We use DocuSign for signatures instead of passing pens around and communication beyond showing homes is done through phone &amp; email. Coldwell&#x27;s lawyers have even drawn up contracts to protect you from penalties regarding coronavirus related instances that delay the purchase/sale of a property. We also ask that you reschedule if you are feeling unwell or have been around others who are sick.
