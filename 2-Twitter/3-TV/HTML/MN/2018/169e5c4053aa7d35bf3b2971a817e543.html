He grew up in southeastern Pennsylvania just about an hour from Philadelphia.  \n\nWhen he was younger, Matt wanted to get into the video game industry as a designer or director. It wasn’t until his junior year of high school that he began to see a career in television as an opportunity. He credits his favorite team, the Philadelphia Eagles winning the Superbowl in 2017 as the catalyst for this change in direction. After seeing them win it all, Matt began to learn more about the world of television and the opportunities available to him through watching ESPN, CBS, ABC, NBC or any network that happened to be talking about sports. This is what inspired him to chase a dream and attend Temple University to be apart of television in any way he could. \n\nDuring his time in college Matt was both a reporter and an anchor for Temple’s award-winning sports program OwlSports Update. He was a volunteer/reporter during all four years at Temple and rounded out his final year in college by being able to anchor the bi-weekly program on TUTV.  \n\nWhen he’s not hard at work, Matt enjoys relaxing and being with others. He also enjoys playing ice hockey in his free time. Matt has played since he was 9 years old and is always ready to lace up the skates. He's currently looking to join a local rec team here in Rochester. Whether its playing video games, hanging out with his family, playing ice hockey, or cheering on his favorite teams, the Phillies and Eagles, you’ll see him having a good time. \n\nAfter four years of college, Matt is eager to get started with KTTC, you can reach him at mrineer@kttc.com

He grew up living in Yangon, Myanmar but decided to embark on a study abroad for higher education. He graduated from Luther College in Iowa with a B.A. in Visual Communication and previously worked as a local news reporter in the college town. Back in Myanmar, he also worked in a seafood restaurant and knows how to make delicious grilled tiger prawns.\n\nEric, like many of his fellow nationals in the United States, can no longer return to Myanmar due to its political instability. Although he yearns to reunite with his family and friends one day, he is proud to call the Midwest home. Despite coming from a tropical country, Iowa trained him to be resistant to the cold.\n\nAn indoor lover, Eric is either cooking or grinding video games when he is away from work. His all-time favorite dish is Myanmar’s coconut milk noodles. He enjoys playing online games as it is a form of hanging out with friends from around the world for him.\n\nEric is excited to be a member of the KTTC team and become a Rochester native.

If you see him wearing yellow and blue ties often on TV, know that is no coincidence, as Noah is a proud University of Michigan alumnus. He received his B.A. in Communication and Media Studies there in May 2020.\n\nDuring his senior year in Ann Arbor, Noah worked as a member of the Big Ten Network. An entirely student-run program, his team covered and produced several live broadcasts of sporting events ranging from gymnastics to hockey. Noah also sang Bass II throughout undergrad for the University of Michigan Men’s Glee Club, and for Kol Hakavod, a Jewish a capella group.\n\nNoah’s two favorite hobbies are travel and sports. Prior to joining KTTC, Noah was writing full-time for his personal sports blog, \"The Weekly Cap.\" During his junior year, Noah participated in a journalism program in Barcelona, Spain for a semester. Though this is Noah’s first time in the state of Minnesota, he can’t wait to explore all the attractions he’s been hearing about.\n\nWhen he’s not working, you can find Noah golfing, listening to lo-fi indie music, or complaining about his alma mater’s football team.

He grew up living in Yangon, Myanmar but decided to embark on a study abroad for higher education. He graduated from Luther College in Iowa with a B.A. in Visual Communication and previously worked as a local news reporter in the college town. Back in Myanmar, he also worked in a seafood restaurant and knows how to make delicious grilled tiger prawns.\n\nEric, like many of his fellow nationals in the United States, can no longer return to Myanmar due to its political instability. Although he yearns to reunite with his family and friends one day, he is proud to call the Midwest home. Despite coming from a tropical country, Iowa trained him to be resistant to the cold.\n\nAn indoor lover, Eric is either cooking or grinding video games when he is away from work. His all-time favorite dish is Myanmar’s coconut milk noodles. He enjoys playing online games as it is a form of hanging out with friends from around the world for him.\n\nEric is excited to be a member of the KTTC team and become a Rochester native.

","longBio":"David joined the KTTC team in July 2023 and comes from the great state of Ohio – Go Bucks! \n\nHe grew up in the suburbs of Cleveland, along the shores of Lake Erie, and is no stranger to the drastic weather the Midwest can bring.\n\nHe recently graduated from The Ohio State University in May of 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Science. Before earning that degree David attended Kent State University and earned a Bachelor of Science in Journalism. During his time in college, he was heavily involved in Kent State’s award-winning, student media program where he gained experience with producing, reporting and weather anchoring. Throughout his academic career, he interned at WOIO, WKBN and The Weather Channel too. \n\nAs a kid, growing up in Northeast, Ohio, David remembers experiencing intense lake effect snowstorms bringing up to two feet of snow, severe thunderstorms, and even seeing the fierce waves Superstorm Sandy brought to Lake Erie in 2012. David ultimately knew he wanted to become a meteorologist after taking an introductory meteorology course at Kent State and using the new knowledge to aid his forecasts. \n\nOutside of work, you can find David exploring the many parks and trails that southeastern Minnesota has. David loves to be outdoors whether that be boating, hiking, or biking. David is excited to start his career in Rochester and to get more experience forecasting all types of weather, but especially winter weather. If you see him around town, feel free to say hi!
