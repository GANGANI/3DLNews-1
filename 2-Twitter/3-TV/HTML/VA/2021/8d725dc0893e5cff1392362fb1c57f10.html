			<h2>Benefits</h2>
            <hr>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
			<p>
				At Gray Television, we offer employees the opportunity to connect with something larger than ourselves. 
				Each day, our employees work alongside great people, on fast – paced, exciting and innovative projects that inspire change in the world around us. 
				At Gray Television, our employees know that growth opportunities are endless and possibilities are all around us.
			</p>
			
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				- But that's not all. - 
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				We understand that life needs balance. 
				That's why we offer our employees and eligible family members a comprehensive benefits packet that helps employees stay healthy, feel secure, and maintain a healthy work/life balance. 
				Employees chose between a variety of health insurance plan options that best meet their lifestyle. 
				Gray Television offers Major Medical, Dental, Vision, Accident Insurance, company-paid Life and Disability programs, Whole Life Insurance, Flexible Spending and Health Savings Accounts, Paid Time Off, and Paid Parental Leave to eligible employees.
			</p>
			
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Free Health Insurance Option
			</h3>
	
			<p>
				In 2023, Gray will offer a FREE health insurance option for all eligible employees. 
				Specifically, in 2023, we will pay 100% of the health insurance premiums for eligible employees with employee-only coverage in our new PPO plan. 
				This plan will offer in-network-only medical insurance with low co-pays for both office visits AND prescriptions.  
				<br><br>
				In addition to this PPO plan, we will offer employees the options to enroll in a low cost High Deductible Health plan with a subsidized Health Savings Account, or in another PPO plan with even lower copays. 
				Gray will also significantly subsidize the health insurance premiums for employees electing one of these options. 
			</p>
	
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				401(K) Company Contributions
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Our 401(k) Plan allows participants to make pre-tax (and Roth) deferrals from their compensation each year, subject to IRS limits.  Gray historically has made matching cash contributions with respect to each participant's elective deferrals.  In 2023, eligible employees who contribute 6% of their pay to their 401(k) account will receive a matching contribution from Gray Television equal to an additional 5% of match, for a total of 11% tax-advantaged savings.  </p><p>
				In addition to the matching cash contributions, Gray historically has made additional voluntary contributions of company stock based on annual company performance.  In fact, Gray's discretionary stock contributions are granted to essentially all employees, including full-time and part-time employees who are not deferring any of their compensation under the 401(k) Plan.  </p><p>
				In recent years, Gray's contributions to eligible employees' 401(k) accounts have totaled tens of millions of dollars in matching cash contributions and additional discretionary contributions of company stock.
			</p>
	
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Employee Assistance Program
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				The EAP is a free, confidential counseling and referral service that can help employees and their families deal with life's challenges. 
				It offers counseling services, work-life resources and referral services. These services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
				Calls and counseling sessions are free to employees and are always confidential.
			</p>

			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Focus On Caring
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				In 2016, Gray employees created the Focus on Caring Program to support our culture of caring for one another. 
				This Program is a non-profit group that provides grants to employees facing significant financial hardship due to unforeseen and catastrophic events. 
				Employees may make charitable contributions via payroll deduction, and the company provides a generous matching donation to each employee donation. 
				If you have questions about Focus on Caring, please email <a href="mailto:FocusOnCaring@gray.tv">FocusOnCaring@gray.tv</a>.
			</p>
	
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Wellness
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				It is important to us that we look out for our employees' health - whether physically, emotionally, financially or socially. 
				We provide a number of incentives to keep employees engaged in wellness to find ways to better manage health, prevent future risk, and experience the most optimal well-being. 
			</p>
			
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Critical Information about Transparency in Coverage
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				This link below leads to the machine readable files that are made available in response to the federal Transparency in Coverage Rule and includes negotiated service rates and out-of-network allowed amounts between health plans and healthcare providers. 
				The machine-readable files are formatted to allow researchers, regulators, and application developers to more easily access and analyze data.

				These links will be updated upon that transition.

			<h2>Employee Professional Development</h2>
            <hr>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-8">
		
			<p>
				At Gray, we are committed to <b>empowering each person within the company</b> to grow, thrive and deliver positive impact to those around us. 
				While we have continued to expand our broadcasting footprint, we have remained committed to keeping news local and doing what we can to ensure our stations continue to remain fixtures in their communities. 
				Connecting with each of the communities that we serve every day is an essential tenet of our corporate mission. 
				We believe that this guiding vision helps us benefit our stockholders, our employees and other stakeholders, the environment and the communities we serve.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The <b>professional advancement of our employees</b> is therefore critical to our success.
				By constantly developing our employees' skills and experience, we help our employees succeed professionally while enabling our stations and businesses to draw upon our existing talent pool to fill vacancies and grow.  
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Promoting from Within
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Gray has long placed a significant emphasis on promoting from within at every level of the company. 
				Existing employees receive first consideration for open positions throughout the Company's many locations and businesses.
				We encourage managers to talk with employees about their career goals and aspirations, and we encourage employees to explore internal career opportunities for promotions and transfers throughout the Company. 
				In 2022 alone, well over 300 Gray employees transferred to new markets to further their careers without leaving the Company. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Indeed, many of our leaders today began their careers decades ago in entry-level positions within Gray. 
				In fact, <b>over the last four years, Gray has filled over 95% of our open positions for television station General Managers and for corporate officers through internal promotions of individuals already working for the company.</b>
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Skills Training and Growth
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				In order to enjoy this level of success from within Gray's ranks, we must make professional development a high priority for all employees. 
				Each year, we invest millions of dollars on formal, live, in-person training and professional development programs for our employees. 
				We continually expand and improve our substantial live and on-demand virtual training courses.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Our training and development programs run the gamut from news gathering skills to sales leads to creative design to digital special effects. 
				Examples include the following:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In <b>News</b>, Gray's executive trainers present live virtual training for all newly hired journalists and newscast producers as well as in-person refresher training sessions.
				We developed and provide several on-demand virtual training courses for news professionals, particularly those in the early years of their careers. 
				We offer various regional training programs for producers and for investigative reporters.  Investigative reporters from across Gray attend the annual Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) conference for in-depth investigative training. 
				We encourage and support journalists in markets both large and small to sharpen their newsroom skills through the seminars and courses offered by the Poynter Institute. 
				In January 2023, Gray will launch an in-house news research and news strategic consulting team led by industry veterans. 
				This team will provide these key services to newsrooms of all sizes throughout the Company. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In <b>Sales and Marketing</b>, we offer multiple live sales training courses and continuing education sale conferences for sellers and sales managers with hundreds of employees participating every year. 
				We offer  online sales certification courses, and we host live virtual training sessions throughout the year. 
				We provide thousands of on-demand training videos to enhance and continue the education of Gray's sales employees. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We offer a variety of formal and informal training programs for our employees <b>in other operational areas</b>, including media production, graphics, promotions, engineering, and technology and digital skills such as IT systems operations, virtualization, cloud computing, streaming, and programming.
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Developing Leaders 
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Gray is a proud sponsor of the <b>Broadcast Leadership Training Program</b> operated by the National Association of Broadcasters Educational Foundation (NABLF). 
				This executive MBA-style program trains senior leaders, particularly women or people of color, with the fundamentals of successful broadcast station operations. 
				BLT's graduates include two of our vice presidents as well as several of our General Managers.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Each year, some of our best news directors and future news directors enroll in the exceptional newsroom leadership program run by the <b>Carole Kneeland Project</b>, of which Gray is also a proud sponsor. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In 2022, Gray created the <b>Gray Leadership Bench</b>. 
				This year-long leadership training program is for exceptional newsroom employees to prepare for opportunities in news management roles.
			</p>
		
			<h3 class="c-darkred">
				Responsible Engagement
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				In addition to investing in the training and development of employees' professional skills and experiences, Gray provides extensive training resources for its employees on critical topics that drive a diverse and inclusive culture, promote employee health and safety, and advance our commitment to all stakeholders.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Driving a diverse and inclusive culture.</i> 
				We are committed to diversity and inclusion in every aspect of our business. 
				As we strive to deliver high-quality products and services that exceed expectations, we embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of our employees and partners and the communities we serve. 
				For instance, we launched a formal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) training program in 2020 that involved all managers and subsequently expanded to wider groups of employees. 
				In 2022, we are launching a new training series for employees, including managers, managers, that cover diversity, equity, inclusion, harassment and discrimination. 
				These programs help ensure that our employees enjoy a respectful and exciting career experience with Gray.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Promoting employee health and safety.</i> 
				All employees are required to comply with company safety rules and expectations and are expected to complete safety training in areas relevant to their job duties, such as first aid, CPR/AED Training, safe driving, ergonomics, and more.  We also pay for employees to engage in selected learning activities from external sources including obtaining professional certifications and earn continuing educational units. 
				We empower employees to improve and maintain their overall health and make an investment in their well-being with programs, activities, contests, and incentives that promote a culture of wellness.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Advancing our commitment to all stakeholders.</i> 
				As media and video production company, we understand that our success depends upon an unwavering obligation to journalistic ethics, compliance with legal, regulatory and antitrust requirements, and a commitment to cybersecurity and customer privacy. 
				We therefore provide training for our employees in all of these areas. 
				For example, every employee is expected to undergo monthly training on cybersecurity topics that help us protect both our systems and privacy of the data to which we are entrusted by our employees, vendors, and communities.
