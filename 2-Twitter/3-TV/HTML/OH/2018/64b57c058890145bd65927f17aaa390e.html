She covered everything from tornadoes to the doctor shortage in rural areas, and a mysterious virus killing piglets.\n\nKelly’s next stop was Panama City Beach, Florida, where several of her stories received national attention. She covered the city’s spring break problem extensively, which included a shooting that injured seven people, including college students, and a gang rape that happened on the beach in the middle of the day. She continued her coverage of spring break by reporting on the new laws the city passed to crack down on spring break. She also covered several presidential rallies in the 2016 election.\n\nKelly’s real passion is investigative reporting. Her piece on the North West Florida Visual Arts Center won her an investigative AP award. Kelly discovered the arts center had lost its non-profit status and brought to light the corruption going on behind the scenes. This led to a criminal investigation of the facility and its eventual shutdown.\n\nKelly continued to be known for her commitment to watchdog journalism in Raleigh. She broke a story about a local non-profit selling untrained and aggressive service dogs to families with special needs children. Her consistent coverage of the story led families across the country to file complaints with the Attorney General’s Office. Kelly’s coverage also encouraged former employees of the non-profit to come forward, claiming the owner abused the dogs and hired unqualified people to train the dogs as service animals. Her reporting led to the owner of the company getting arrested and charged with 42 counts of obtaining property by false pretenses.\n\nHere in Northeast Ohio Kelly discovered several cases of local Black men seemingly minding their own business and getting the police called on them. Her reporting caught the attention of lawmakers and led to the introduction of “Darren’s Law” in 2021. The bill would allow the victim’s of racially motivated 911 calls to sue the callers for damages. It would also require implicit bias training for the caller if the court finds in favor of the person bringing the civil suit.\n\nKelly’s reporting also exposed a former Northeast Ohio dance teacher as a sexual predator leading to his eventual arrest and conviction. In 2022 Desmond Beasley was sentenced to 15 years in prison for raping girls as young as 13 years old. Her reporting received an Emmy nomination later that year.\n\nKelly is a regular contributor to the 19 Investigative podcast, “Dark Side of the Land.”\n\nWhen she’s not working, Kelly enjoys cooking, step aerobics, kickboxing, hanging out with her husband and her two cats, and traveling whenever she can.\n\nIf you have a story idea, shoot Kelly an email at Kelly.Kennedy@woio.com or follow her on social media @kellyekennedytv.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"","status":true,"type":"author","last_updated_date":"2024-03-13T16:21:31.365Z","twitter":"kellyekennedytv","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Kelly.Kennedy.Journalist","instagram":"kellyekennedytv","custom_gray_stationname":"woio","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T03:33:04.125Z","description":{"basic":"Stark County Sheriff’s deputies are searching for a group of kids caught on camera vandalizing Faircrest Park in Canton Township."},"headlines":{"basic":"Stark County Sheriff searching for juveniles who vandalized park with anti-police graffiti","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/jWHr_ozBjiJrwUxewkyTEgaQJhQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E.bmp","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"application/octet-stream","originalName":"Still0530_00000.bmp","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E.bmp","owner":"kelly.kennedy@woio.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/jWHr_ozBjiJrwUxewkyTEgaQJhQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E.bmp","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/jWHr_ozBjiJrwUxewkyTEgaQJhQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E.bmp","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/wiI_H3g4NW8EPvl4OGkyPElf7ek=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/N6TQRYRAURB7HD4WRPMXROOZ4E.bmp","usage_instructions":"cleared","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"266509f67dd0880559d14bc4363d850ea3eabf44fc00b50b7eaff58f4cee97da"},"caption":"The vandals spray painted trees, concrete slabs, the pavilion and outside of the bathroom.

Hailing from Concord, Ohio but a born and raised Clevelander, she is ecstatic to report in her hometown and dream city. \nPrior to joining the 19 News team, Rachel graduated from John Carroll University in 2017 with Cum Laude honors, and as a member of the National Communications Honor Society Lambda Pi Eta and the National Jesuit Honor Society Alpha Sigma Nu.\nAt college, she was a Reporter, Host, Entertainment Producer, the first female Sports Director/Producer, and the first female President of the campus news organization, JCTV.\nOutside of the studio, she was a multiple-award winning journalist for Odyssey and the student newspaper The Carroll News.\nRachel believes in hard hitting, soul searching, truth telling reporting that finds the untold facts, seeks to bring justice, and spotlights the everyday heroes in our world. This is why she sets forth to find and tell the \"Google-Proof\" stories that you can't find anywhere else, because it has never before been told by anyone else.\nAside from reporting, Rachel’s other love is for dance. Her first job was as a ballerina for Ballet San Jose’s The Nutcracker before dancing with the Radio City Rockettes for three years at Radio City Music Hall. Rachel took her dance career’s final bow as the Captain of the John Carroll University Dance Team.\nThere are two causes Rachel is a passionate advocate for: anti-bullying and care for companion animals.\nAfter transferring to Riverside High School as a victim of severe bullying, she founded the district's anti-bullying program. While a version of that program still exists a decade after she graduated, Rachel is creating a foundation in an effort to continue supporting children and teens in the local schools.\nShe is also creating a foundation called Rachel's Rescues to promote the care, safety, and protection of all companion animals, and especially the adoption of companion pets by working with animal advocacy groups, shelters, and humane societies.","org":"WOIO","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Traffic Anchor / Emmy-Nominated Cleveland Now Host / Friday Football Frenzy Reporter / Assignment Desk Editor / Digital Content Producer","slug":"rachel-vadaj","source":{"source_id":"62882"},"status":true,"twitter":"NewsRach","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2023-07-26T23:45:58.855Z","custom_gray_stationname":"woio","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:48:42.667Z","description":{"basic":"APD said he spent the last “56 dog years” alongside his handler.

Hailing from Concord, Ohio but a born and raised Clevelander, she is ecstatic to report in her hometown and dream city. \nPrior to joining the 19 News team, Rachel graduated from John Carroll University in 2017 with Cum Laude honors, and as a member of the National Communications Honor Society Lambda Pi Eta and the National Jesuit Honor Society Alpha Sigma Nu.\nAt college, she was a Reporter, Host, Entertainment Producer, the first female Sports Director/Producer, and the first female President of the campus news organization, JCTV.\nOutside of the studio, she was a multiple-award winning journalist for Odyssey and the student newspaper The Carroll News.\nRachel believes in hard hitting, soul searching, truth telling reporting that finds the untold facts, seeks to bring justice, and spotlights the everyday heroes in our world. This is why she sets forth to find and tell the \"Google-Proof\" stories that you can't find anywhere else, because it has never before been told by anyone else.\nAside from reporting, Rachel’s other love is for dance. Her first job was as a ballerina for Ballet San Jose’s The Nutcracker before dancing with the Radio City Rockettes for three years at Radio City Music Hall. Rachel took her dance career’s final bow as the Captain of the John Carroll University Dance Team.\nThere are two causes Rachel is a passionate advocate for: anti-bullying and care for companion animals.\nAfter transferring to Riverside High School as a victim of severe bullying, she founded the district's anti-bullying program. While a version of that program still exists a decade after she graduated, Rachel is creating a foundation in an effort to continue supporting children and teens in the local schools.\nShe is also creating a foundation called Rachel's Rescues to promote the care, safety, and protection of all companion animals, and especially the adoption of companion pets by working with animal advocacy groups, shelters, and humane societies.","org":"WOIO","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Traffic Anchor / Emmy-Nominated Cleveland Now Host / Friday Football Frenzy Reporter / Assignment Desk

Although she loved working on documentaries and long-form pieces she aspired to step in front of the camera to tell the stories.\n\nSia reported for the CBS affiliate in Wichita, Kan. and before at the CBS affiliate in Gainesville, Fla.\n\nA skilled multimedia journalist, Sia prides herself on shooting, reporting, writing and editing the majority of her reports for multiple platforms.\n\nSia enjoys being out in the field and loves hearing people's stories. Her sincerity and commitment to telling the truth is what she says usually gets people to open up and talk to her. She believes it is how she scores most of her exclusives.\n\nAfter the death of George Floyd in 2020, Sia and 3 other journalists at WOIO-TV created the award-winning series “The Next 400.” The stories take a “deeper dive” into topics like systemic racism, housing discrimination, policing, education, social justice, public health, contemporary life and more. The small team assembled an external advisory council composed of community stakeholders, using new and diverse voices from all different backgrounds to share unique points of views. The stories offered ideas and solutions on how the next 400 years could and should look like for society. In 2021 & 2022, Sia’s series of reports “The Next 400: #DefendBlackWomen” & “The Next 400: Digging into the Tangled Roots of Black Hair Culture” received national recognition with Gracie Awards from the Alliance From Women in Media Foundation. \n\nSia and her reports have been featured on national shows such as TV One's Fatal Attraction, Oxygen's Snapped and the Investigation Discovery channel.\n\nSia holds a Bachelor of Arts Journalism from Indiana University's Ernie Pyle School of Journalism and a Master of Science in Journalism from Columbia University in the City of New York. Her master's thesis was an award-winning documentary film about a Harlem muralist that broadcast on public television stations across the nation.\n\nActive with the National Association of Black Journalists, Sia serves at the local and national level and is a mentor to young, aspiring journalists. She is also a member of the public service sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\nSia is a parishioner at Church of St. Dominic in Shaker Heights and volunteers at St. Augustine Hunger Center in Tremont. In 2019, she was honored with a Community Service Award for feeding the hungry. \n\n \n\nIn 2023, the Cuyahoga County Section-National Council of Negro Women, Inc. recognized Sia with a Trailblazer Award for being one of the “Dynamic Voices for our Community in Broadcast Journalism.\"\n\n \n\nMost recently, Cleveland Magazine selected Sia as one of the “Most Interesting People” to know in 2024; the movers, shakers and doers who are making a difference in Northeast Ohio.\n\n \n\nA native of Indianapolis, Ind., Sia is thrilled to be next door to home where she can visit her parents and cheer on her HOOSIERS!\n\nShe says the most common question she receives is about her name, which hails from Liberia, West Africa. Sia means first daughter of the father and Nyorkor means fierce warrior in her father's tribe, Kissi.\n\nA novice shutterbug, Sia enjoys exploring new places, listening to live music, cooking, reading and meeting new people.","org":"WOIO","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"slug":"sia-nyorkor","source":{"source_id":"53635"},"status":true,"twitter":"TVNewsLady","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2024-01-08T22:48:22.020Z","custom_gray_stationname":"woio","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"administrative","role":"Anchor / Reporter"}}},{"_id":"madeline-harden","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Madeline Harden","org":"Cleveland, WOIO","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/d2283b6c-db0f-4594-bd72-4a263c62f7a3.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Madeline Harden is an Assignment Desk Editor and Digital Content Producer for 19 News.","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"madeline.harden@woio.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"madeline.harden@woio.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"madeline-harden","firstName":"Madeline","lastName":"Harden","byline":"Madeline Harden","role":"Assignment Desk Editor / Digital Content Producer","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/d2283b6c-db0f-4594-bd72-4a263c62f7a3.jpg","email":"madeline.harden@woio.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"Madeline Harden is an Assignment Desk Editor and Digital Content Producer for 19 News.","longBio":"Madeline Harden is an Assignment Desk Editor and Digital Content Producer for 19 News. \n\nShe returns after spending last summer as a news intern.

Before coming to Cleveland, her first job took her to Bryan/College Station, Texas where she was able to forecast tropical weather and enjoy very hot and humid summers. The next stop was tornado alley where she worked in Wichita, Kansas. There she was able to track everything from tornadoes live from their storm tracking vehicle to dust storms and wildfires. She is excited for this next challenge of forecasting lake effect impacts from Lake Erie. \n \nErika grew up in Northern Indiana and is no stranger to the Great Lakes region. She loves science and was always curious about the sky and various weather phenomena. She took that passion to Northwest Indiana where she attended Valparaiso University. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Meteorology with minors in mathematics and communications. \n \nShe is excited to be back in the Great Lakes, which is closer to home and family both here in Cleveland and the surrounding states. Erika loves to attend sporting events, especially baseball, and is excited to enjoy the Cleveland sports scene as well as the sights and food all across Northeast Ohio.

She also co-hosts the 19 Investigates true crime podcast Dark Side of the Land.  Her stories about PTSD and mental health in the first responder community have helped change city policy and raise awareness of the issue.  \n\n\n\nSara grew up outside of Philadelphia and spent several years living out West. \n\nBefore 19 News, Sara was a reporter at KNXV in Phoenix, Arizona.  \n\nWhile there, she covered the heartbreaking story of the Yarnell 19, a massive wildfire that killed 19 hotshot firefighters near Prescott, Arizona. She will never forget telling their stories. \n\n\n\nSara's dedication to watchdog journalism also led to aggressive coverage of mismanagement and delayed care at the Phoenix VA. Her stories led eight U.S. Congress members to call for a new investigation into the hospital in early 2015. Several whistle blowers came forward to Sara to share their stories, alleging mishandling of suicides at the VA. The President visited the hospital just weeks later, announcing a new plan for reform. \n\n\n\nWhile reporting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sara covered the devastating tornado that ripped through Joplin, Missouri. She was one of the first reporters on the scene just hours after it hit and will always remember the incredible stories of resilience and recovery she reported on in the aftermath. Sara also won a Heartland Emmy award for her contribution to a news special on fighting teen bullying while working at KJRH. \n\n\n\nSara got her start at KJCT in Grand Junction, Colorado.
