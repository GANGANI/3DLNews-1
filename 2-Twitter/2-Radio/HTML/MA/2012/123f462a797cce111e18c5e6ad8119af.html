As the band played their album top to bottom, the crowd sang along for the whole set, eating up every second of interaction. No corner of the crowd was left unattended, as the five key members spread across the entire width of the stage, each performing with passion and drama while never outshining the others. Abigail made for a natural frontwoman, confidently parading around stage, but every member made their presence known. Emily Roberts offered impressive solos on both the guitar and flute, while Georgia Davies effortlessly held down the rhythm with a twirl of her ribbon-clad bass guitar. And of course, the band’s signature sound would not be the same without the melancholy harmonies that Lizzie Mayland and Aurora Nishevci provided with their voices and instruments.","_key":"124c0e63702f0"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"37d6592c1a23","markDefs":[]},{"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"","_key":"1bfe76d7f0cc0"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"a73ac0b19d13","markDefs":[]},{"_type":"image","_key":"326daf03d757","asset":{"_ref":"image-da192a6634a9343f24e27cffbd7ea6d92034d796-5276x3517-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"image","_key":"e46214dcdb04","asset":{"_ref":"image-77e6dabb124778deed5b9275a18c9338afc7dd65-5166x3444-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"text":"The Last Dinner Party.","_key":"4e6825fcaa2a","_type":"span","marks":["em"]}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"01b72bb08b38"},{"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"e2cc6fd015ee","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"9fdaee326508","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}]},{"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"77a0304a693c","markDefs":[],"children":[{"text":"Seamlessly delivering both touching ballads and bright, energetic numbers like “Sinner,” The Last Dinner Party took the audience through a journey of love, loss and every emotion in between. The band had sky-high expectations on their U.S. debut after their quick rise to fame, and they certainly delivered in Boston. Performing way beyond their years as a band, they had their audience wrapped around their fingers. Short and sweet, they played through their whole discography in less than an hour, leaving fans wanting even more. From the cohesion of music, outfits, and even the baroque details of Royale as a venue, arguably the biggest part of The Last Dinner Party’s success is in their distinct identity from their conception, leading to a fervently dedicated fanbase in a very specific niche.

This sentiment is exemplified in “Hanging From The Bridge”: “How long, how long can we hold on? // Holding on to a thread // Thoughts spinning in my head.” Psykos is a self-psyko-analysis of the unique minds of both artists. At the end of “Enemy,” Lean wards off dark thoughts by repeating “Fire and love wash over me,” transitioning into the hopeful outro “Things Happen” where they come to their conclusion.

One by one, each of the five members of The Last Dinner Party, as well as their drummer, took the stage. Last to arrive was lead singer, Abigail Morris, who drew a near-feral reaction from the venue full of superfans. As the band played their album top to bottom, the crowd sang along for the whole set, eating up every second of interaction. No corner of the crowd was left unattended, as the five key members spread across the entire width of the stage, each performing with passion and drama while never outshining the others. Abigail made for a natural frontwoman, confidently parading around stage, but every member made their presence known. Emily Roberts offered impressive solos on both the guitar and flute, while Georgia Davies effortlessly held down the rhythm with a twirl of her ribbon-clad bass guitar. And of course, the band’s signature sound would not be the same without the melancholy harmonies that Lizzie Mayland and Aurora Nishevci provided with their voices and instruments.","_key":"124c0e63702f0","_type":"span","marks":[]}],"_type":"block"},{"style":"normal","_key":"a73ac0b19d13","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"","_key":"1bfe76d7f0cc0"}],"_type":"block"},{"_type":"image","_key":"326daf03d757","asset":{"_ref":"image-da192a6634a9343f24e27cffbd7ea6d92034d796-5276x3517-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"image","_key":"e46214dcdb04","asset":{"_ref":"image-77e6dabb124778deed5b9275a18c9338afc7dd65-5166x3444-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"style":"normal","_key":"01b72bb08b38","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"The Last Dinner Party.","_key":"4e6825fcaa2a"}],"_type":"block"},{"_key":"e2cc6fd015ee","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"9fdaee326508","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Seamlessly delivering both touching ballads and bright, energetic numbers like “Sinner,” The Last Dinner Party took the audience through a journey of love, loss and every emotion in between.

Performing way beyond their years as a band, they had their audience wrapped around their fingers. Short and sweet, they played through their whole discography in less than an hour, leaving fans wanting even more. From the cohesion of music, outfits, and even the baroque details of Royale as a venue, arguably the biggest part of The Last Dinner Party’s success is in their distinct identity from their conception, leading to a fervently dedicated fanbase in a very specific niche. It will be exciting to see where time will take this band as they mature, but after their fiery show in Boston, it’s clear that they are here to stay.","_key":"b67d21756a88"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"77a0304a693c"},{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"725bd38e8ca2","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"840c395365be"},{"children":[{"_key":"164615af908e","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"173d1978134e","markDefs":[]},{"_type":"image","_key":"4b55270fc398","asset":{"_ref":"image-bb4c667ce58c616ec4c829d3230da93d3d35c417-4480x6720-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"image","_key":"648565085d2e","asset":{"_ref":"image-571c70a08f64c544441d543582a818f1c682e56c-4257x6385-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"image","_key":"837ade403e11","asset":{"_ref":"image-22d912b78064237af7d3cca421dc693dd7fcae4c-4182x6273-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"image","_key":"d8b740a242bc","asset":{"_ref":"image-dad4e9d225b2371e56cf421e59123e5d616218d9-3319x4979-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_key":"288da8f7bae4","asset":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"image-9fb6e5c0ab0f2fd49b86a57c0a6498f50a071b95-4197x6295-jpg"},"_type":"image"}],"image":{"path":"images/svnaozq2/production/be0494cd96e6be215780529111ef6ac8057b61dc-4257x2779.jpg","_createdAt":"2024-04-05T04:56:11Z","metadata":{"_type":"sanity.imageMetadata","palette":{"vibrant":{"foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":0,"background":"#837b7d","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch"},"dominant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":10.3,"background":"#4d4949"},"_type":"sanity.imagePalette","darkMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":10.3,"background":"#4d4949"},"muted":{"population":9.3,"background":"#747070","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff"},"lightVibrant":{"foreground":"#000","title":"#fff","population":0,"background":"#bebabb","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch"},"darkVibrant":{"background":"#444041","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":0},"lightMuted":{"foreground":"#000","title":"#fff","population":3.25,"background":"#c5c1c2","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch"}},"hasAlpha":false,"lqip":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","dimensions":{"_type":"sanity.imageDimensions","width":4257,"aspectRatio":1.5318459877653832,"height":2779},"isOpaque":true,"blurHash":"VECi]s~qIU?bxu?b-;xut7xu00IUt7D%WB9FD%M{IUIU"},"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/svnaozq2/production/be0494cd96e6be215780529111ef6ac8057b61dc-4257x2779.jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","_rev":"Ar19jrAZ1MlIiaihKvoWhQ","_type":"sanity.imageAsset","extension":"jpg","sha1hash":"be0494cd96e6be215780529111ef6ac8057b61dc","size":6282511,"assetId":"be0494cd96e6be215780529111ef6ac8057b61dc","_id":"image-be0494cd96e6be215780529111ef6ac8057b61dc-4257x2779-jpg","_updatedAt":"2024-04-05T04:56:11Z","originalFilename":"TLDP -

I was most excited to hear him perform some of his newer music like “WAR!” and “SWITCH” which are more sultry, seductive songs. The most iconic aspect of “WAR!” are the silly ad-libs, which Destin Conrad playfully relayed to an enthusiastic audience. Following these songs, he sang “IN THE AIR” which also happens to be his most popular song on Spotify. This song is an earworm that I have had on repeat so, I was particularly enchanted by his rendition of this song. Singing each note so seamlessly, I was shocked to hear Destin Conrad sounded just as good, if not better performing live. I patiently waited to hear the song that led me to Destin Conrad’s music in the first place, “UNPREDICTABLE” which is an addictive R\u0026B collaboration with artist Kiana Ledé. It is hard to imagine this track without the incredible vocals of Kiana Ledé yet, Destin Conrad made the song his own, completely blowing the performance away.","_key":"8e0d7c46174c4","_type":"span","marks":[]}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"dd8c73dfa623"},{"_key":"b2ce844b1fda","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"","_key":"ab95cfac23ce0"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"markDefs":[],"children":[{"text":"Overall, Destin Conrad’s SUBMISSIVE Tour was a phenomenal concert experience marked by extraordinary performances. This was one of those concerts that has you falling back in love with an artist or album you already listen to, because the live experience was so remarkable. The fluorescent, rainbow-changing lights intensified the queerness and aesthetic pleasure of the performance. The curation of the setlist was deliberate, as each song flawlessly flowed into one another keeping a continual soul-soothing, rhythmic vibe throughout the performance. Amaria and Destin Conrad’s sounds worked so well together which is a rare occurrence between an opening act and main performer. Destin Conrad performed an ample blend of his current music alongside older hits and fan favorites. Although his discography is on the smaller side, Destin Conrad had a jam-packed setlist with the right amount of music keeping the audience engaged without dragging it out. If you are looking for a concert with some chill, feel good ambience, then I wholeheartedly recommend seeing Destin Conrad in concert. ","_key":"8e0e5e7ce0090","_type":"span","marks":[]}],"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"4f126d8cf798"}],"author":"Bella Carbone","_rev":"wud1i9YDLmNsV9RQhkWHSn","image":{"_updatedAt":"2024-03-20T11:54:10Z","originalFilename":"d5384381-75eb-4942-82d0-32cacd00e6fb_TABLET_LANDSCAPE_LARGE_16_9.jpg","mimeType":"image/jpeg","assetId":"77d4a8f37d284b1582397eb60f5503ca2c629e2e","size":217057,"_createdAt":"2024-03-20T11:54:10Z","_id":"image-77d4a8f37d284b1582397eb60f5503ca2c629e2e-1797x1152-jpg","extension":"jpg","path":"images/svnaozq2/production/77d4a8f37d284b1582397eb60f5503ca2c629e2e-1797x1152.jpg","_type":"sanity.imageAsset","metadata":{"blurHash":"VECZ9~%i0EEC-}03RO~Vo~Q,t1j=aJnjOt%LbIM}skt6","_type":"sanity.imageMetadata","palette":{"darkVibrant":{"background":"#202265","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":3.79},"lightMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#000","title":"#fff","population":0.12,"background":"#dbc1b5"},"vibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":6.19,"background":"#2c4cb3"},"dominant":{"title":"#fff","population":6.19,"background":"#2c4cb3","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff"},"_type":"sanity.imagePalette","darkMuted":{"foreground":"#fff","title":"#fff","population":0.23,"background":"#63463e","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch"},"muted":{"title":"#fff","population":0.33,"background":"#514f92","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#fff"},"lightVibrant":{"background":"#d5a289","_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","foreground":"#000","title":"#fff","population":1.42}},"hasAlpha":false,"lqip":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","dimensions":{"width":1797,"aspectRatio":1.5598958333333333,"height":1152,"_type":"sanity.imageDimensions"},"isOpaque":true},"uploadId":"0ASBrbiBkEuvYFQVkQQ4F42aT1OBMt5a","url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/svnaozq2/production/77d4a8f37d284b1582397eb60f5503ca2c629e2e-1797x1152.jpg","_rev":"wud1i9YDLmNsV9RQhkWFm1","sha1hash":"77d4a8f37d284b1582397eb60f5503ca2c629e2e"},"type":"show","_updatedAt":"2024-03-20T11:54:13Z","slug":{"current":"destin-conrad-paradise-rock-club","_type":"slug"},"_createdAt":"2024-03-17T01:27:03Z","authorSlug":"bella-carbone"},{"_updatedAt":"2024-02-27T23:36:40Z","_createdAt":"2024-02-23T20:01:28Z","_rev":"z95ajgewlcOWxDzG4Oek7w","author":"Maya Patel","_type":"article","title":"berlioz’s show infects Boston with the vibrations of jazz and house","date":"2024-02-14","authorSlug":"maya-patel","_id":"5687388a-e1e6-46ce-a2e8-7759c207be07","type":"show","slug":{"current":"berliozs-show-infects-boston-with-the-vibrations-of-jazz-and-house","_type":"slug"},"content":[{"_key":"a5a4e92a3f38","markDefs":[],"children":[{"text":"berlioz, also known as Jasper Attlee or Ted Jasper, graced Boston on Valentine’s Day at the intimate venue of Brighton Music Hall.

These three helped bring beriloz’s unique sound to life as they infiltrated the room with their passionate and melodious tunes. Reed brought groovy basslines that had the crowd dancing while Carrillo serenaded the crowd with his sultry saxophone.
