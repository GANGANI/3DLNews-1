A student athlete at Cornell, Digit was named Ivy League Player of the Year, finishing her college career with 123 goals and 90 assists.  Digit loved the sport so much, she coached at Brown University for 23 seasons and holds the record as the winningest ice hockey coach in NCAA Division 1 history.  But as she climbed the ladder in sports, Digit experienced pay inequality herself and fought for Olympic ice hockey athletes to be paid for the very first time.  She would go on to coach on the pro level in the US, Canada, and China, with a philosophy focused on leading, guiding, and directing athletes.  Says Digit:  “You are like a conductor creating energy. You give your athletes a roadmap and the keys to the car, and then you let them drive.”  In this interview, Digit takes us for a wild ride through a career in ice hockey that stands alone when it comes to creating opportunities for females:  “Half a loaf is not enough.

A gifted athlete, she began missing the ball while playing lacrosse and soccer. One of her coaches suggested that she have her eyes checked. Unfortunately, glasses didn’t do much to solve the problem. Throughout her teens, Eavan’s eyesight continued to deteriorate, and in this interview, she admits that wishful thinking set in until one day, she mistook the moon for a street light and it was obvious something was very wrong. Diagnosed at 20 by Rachel Huckfeldt, MD, PhD, an opthalmologist in the Inherited Retinal Disorders Service at Mass Eye And Ear, with a rare and incurable condition called Stargardt disease, Eavan is now legally blind. In this interview, she recalls returning to St. Lawrence University after her diagnosis in January 2020, only to go home two months later to her family in Yarmouth, Maine, due to the pandemic. Distraught and uncertain about her future, she accepted an invitation from her neighbor to go for a run and discovered that running flipped a switch inside of her. Says Eavan: “Running has made me feel strong, happy, and capable again.” An experienced marathoner who can only see 4 feet in front of her, Eavan runs to raise awareness and funds for a cure for Stargardt disease. Now a Development Officer at Mass General Brigham, Eavan is determined to be a voice for anyone struggling with this rare disease: “I felt so isolated when I was first diagnosed. It was like diving off of a cliff into no-man’s land. It’s hard to find hope. That’s what I want to be for people. Hope.” Although she still has “bad blind girl days,” Eavan looks on the bright side with her Instagram handle @bright.side_group.

This interview was taped in between newscasts at WCVB, Channel 5, www.wcvb.com where she anchors the 4:30, 6:00, 7:00, and 11:00 PM newscasts. And for good measure, Maria also anchors the 10:00 PM news on sister station MeTVBoston. A devoted mother, this high-energy, high-empathy woman has been honing her craft for 30 years and says that going to bed at midnight is simply routine. Born and raised in the little town of Groveland, MA, Maria recalls an idyllic childhood where she would climb trees and skate in the woods in a town with no traffic light. Her heritage is Greek (think My Big Fat Greek Wedding), and laughter, passion, loyalty, and hard work were hard-wired into the family dynamic. A graduate of Emerson College with bachelor's and master's degrees in Mass Communications, Maria got her start on the radio as a statehouse reporter and credits that experience with teaching her how to tell compelling stories. In this interview, she reveals that a scratch ticket and a conversation with a colleague propelled her toward television, and she’s been there ever since. On the air for massive news events like 9/11 and the Boston Marathon bombings, Maria takes us behind the scenes, painting a picture of what it is really like to be a responsible, compassionate journalist in the middle of a tragedy. When asked about role models, she quickly names her mother, offering one of her parent’s golden rules: “Don’t judge people. You never know what they are going through.” In this interview, we come to know WCVB’s Maria Stephanos not only as a beloved news anchor but also as a daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend, mentor, and running enthusiast.

We bring kids together in a room where they get to play instruments and sing loudly.” The success story of the School of Rock could have been destroyed by the pandemic, but instead, it was lifted to a whole new level under her guidance with a pivot to virtual learning through a robust online platform that managed to create a sense of community for kids when they needed it the most. In this interview, Stacey shares her firm belief that music heals. The School of Rock is a place where differences are celebrated, and confidence grows. Born in Queens, New York, and raised in Monmouth County, New Jersey, Stacey is the middle child in a music-loving family. She credits her father with introducing her to boxes of his rock albums. Alone on a desert island, she’d listen to the entire Beatles collection and never be lonely. A graduate of Rutgers University, she was inspired by her mother’s lifelong love of education and, at first, wanted to be a kindergarten teacher until the smell of the school cafeteria did her in. “I listened to my gut,” says Stacey, and I switched paths.“ As a leader, Stacey leans on transparency and is advancing women leaders through an organization she calls “Front Women”.

She parlayed decades of experience in front of and behind cameras into the role of Director of PR and Media Relations at female-owned Nickerson, www.nickersoncos.com, a full-service branding, marketing, PR, and communications agency with offices in Boston and Miami. Born and raised in Stamford, Connecticut, Shannon started playing soccer at only 5, and was a self-described “scrappy tomboy who was toughened up by her two older brothers.” A determined student and athlete, Shannon attended the prestigious Philips Exeter Academy at only 13, followed by Wellesley College and Emerson College where she earned her Masters in Journalism. Her career path began with an off-camera job in Fort Myers, Florida, where Shannon managed to sneak herself into a weekend show without permission. This bold move was followed by an on-camera stint at a heritage news station in Tampa. She finally landed in Boston thanks to being given an opportunity to shine by fellow Emerson graduate and mentor Maria Stephanos. Says Shannon: “Every step of the way, I have been lifted up by other women. “ In this interview, Shannon brings the listener into the not-so-glamourous world of television news where 2 AM wake-up calls are a way of life. After spending a few years doing morning news at Fox 25, Shannon found herself at a crossroads and decided to make the kind of change that enabled her to be a more present mother to her three young children while still using her vast communications skillset. When asked about her work ethic, Shannon says: “Soccer raised me because it taught me life skills. I work hard, and I believe that if you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude. You can’t control what other people are going to do, but you can control how you are going to react to it.” For 24 minutes of wisdom you can use, just hit that download button. #media #news #PR #television #thestorybehindhersuccess","startDate":1713481146000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVzdG9yeWJlaGluZGhlcnN1Y2Nlc3MuYmx1YnJyeS5uZXQvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjQvMDEvU0JIUy1zaG93LWdyYXBoaWMtMjAyNC5qcGc"},{"id":166717472,"podcastId":31078780,"podcastSlug":"867-the-story-behind-her-succe","title":"Julie Beckham: aka Ms. Money  -266","duration":1337,"isExplicit":false,"description":"Lessons learned early last a lifetime. -Julie Beckham aka “Ms. Money”\n\nNot everyone thinks personal finance is a topic to sing about, but Julie Beckham has made a career out of it.

Always up for a challenge, Julie tapped into her wealth of experience as an actress and singer to create her persona “Ms. Money” and her musical, “Ms. Money & the Coins.” For the last 13 years, she’s been sharing this entertaining curriculum with children in the United States and around the world www.rocklandtrust.com. What started out as an idea to teach children about money turned into a multilingual video-based program, complete with interactive learning modules. Says Julie: “If I can make something fun for children and easy for teachers, that’s a win-win.” Born and raised in Canton, Massachusetts, Julie’s love for the theatre was born when she landed the role of Dorothy in her elementary school’s production of The Wizard of Oz. A graduate of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, Julie was a working actor for years before returning home to be a hands-on aunt to her newborn niece, Lucy, who was born with Downs Syndrome. Says Julie: “The world stopped, and we needed each other. You discover what the epicenter of YOU is and for me, that’s family.” The mother of two children, Julie shares her belief that “it is crucial for parents to share their mistakes.

Jane Anderson oversees 10-week support groups for everyone from young moms to senior citizens. Christina explains: “The best way to overcome the loneliness of divorce is to talk to women who get it.

A lifelong resident of Boston, Monica was raised in a home full of faith, rules, and love. She credits her mother for advocating for her and her siblings, reminding them about the value of a strong education. In this interview, Monica shares the story of her father, the son of a sharecropper from Mississippi who quit school at 12 to work in the fields and later completed his education. Monica’s father was a man of service who worked as a truck driver through the night, often distributing food to the needy and plowing his neighbor’s driveways during snow storms. As a preacher in their local church, her dad did not allow his daughters to wear makeup or go to the movie theater. A first-generation college graduate with degrees from Brandeis and Boston College, Monica comes to her position at City Year with extensive experience in public education, having served seven superintendents over a fifteen-year period. Before taking the reins at City Year Greater Boston, she worked at Peace First, a national non-profit, where she honed her leadership skills. For Monica, City Year is a life-changing opportunity for young men and women between the ages 18-25 who support the education of children enrolled in their partner schools. Originally founded in 1988 as a community-based service organization, the mission has expanded and City Year members are changing the lives of kids from kindergarten through high school every day. Grounded in the belief that young people can shape our world, City Year members are role models. Says Monica: “They connect with kids and cheer them on. The City Year red jacket symbolizes the deep investment we have made in the communities we serve.” @cityyear @cityyearboston #community","startDate":1711044906000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVzdG9yeWJlaGluZGhlcnN1Y2Nlc3MuYmx1YnJyeS5uZXQvd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjQvMDEvU0JIUy1zaG93LWdyYXBoaWMtMjAyNC5qcGc"},{"id":159264698,"podcastId":31078780,"podcastSlug":"867-the-story-behind-her-succe","title":"Lisa Carlin: Founder of Poppies with Purpose -263","duration":1453,"isExplicit":false,"description":"Poppies with Purpose is more than a shoe line. It is something that is going to bring courage, joy, and connection whether you have cancer or not. -Lisa Carlin\n\nWhen bad things happen, you have two choices: you can give up or give it all you’ve got. Lisa Carlin decided to use her breast cancer diagnosis as a catalyst for comfort through the creation of her shoe line, Poppies with Purpose www.poppieswithpurpose.com. At only 38, with two daughters, ages 3 and 5, at home, she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. Lisa’s road to survivorship included a double mastectomy, breast reconstruction, eight rounds of chemotherapy, and 6 weeks of daily radiation treatments. During this dark time in her life, she discovered a worn pair of pink ballet flats in the back of her closet. Slipping them on one morning before her treatment, Lisa discovered that these simple pink shoes gave her a dose of bravery. Today, Poppies with Purpose is thriving with three shoe colors: pink for breast cancer, blue for colorectal cancer, and tangerine for kidney cancer and leukemia, with a portion of the proceeds benefitting researcHERS, a group that supports grants to female cancer scientists. Lisa also handpicks local charities to support including Runway for Recovery. Every detail of Lisa’s brand is inspired by love. The duster bag that holds each pair of shoes was inspired by her beloved grandmother’s poppy-patterned house coat, and inside every pair of shoes is a reminder to “live each day with a pop of color.” When I asked Lisa how she got through her diagnosis, she said, “It was baby steps. Just a little bit every day is gonna get you to where you want to go. The key is to surround yourself with people who lift you up.” The next time you need a gift for a newly diagnosed friend, think of Lisa and Poppies with Purpose.

I help them understand that mistakes are part of the learning process. -Noel Foy\n\nIn the spotlight, Noel Foy. Known as Neuro Noel, she got her start as a teacher and learning specialist before blazing a trail as a neuroeducator and anxiety coach. www.neuronoel.com. A graduate of Boston College with a B.A. in Education/Special Education and a Masters in American Studies, Noel began noticing that her own sons didn’t like school, but they loved learning. She started attending conferences focused on how the brain works and discovered that she could transform key neuroscience findings into practical ways to reduce the impact of stress on children. The result was transformative. Noel started creating her neuroeducator tool kit by recognizing that if a child’s brain is in a state of anxiety, anger, frustration, or boredom, they disengage from learning. This choice hijacks the brain causing stress, which in turn, hijacks executive function. In her practice, Noel teaches kids that the human brain grows and changes. This neuroplasticity enables the brain to be re-wired. Children are relieved when she explains: “Do you know that your brain gets smarter and stronger when you correct mistakes?” In this interview, Neuro Noel provides clues for parents who believe their children might need help with anxiety. Avoidance, rigidity, catastrophic thinking, and a sense of hopeless permanence are four red flags to look for. The author of two award-winning books called ABC Worry Free and Are You A Bird Like Me? Noel admits she was an anxious child herself and that she finds healing by helping kids who are just like she was. On a mission to spread awareness about anxiety, executive function, and how to use neuroscience in school and beyond, Noel is due to release a third book this year entitled 15 Minute Focus, geared toward teachers, parents, and counselors.

LaVergne, the executor of Simpson's estate, said he received the former NFL MVP's death certificate and confirmed that the previously unspecified cancer diagnosis was of the prostate form.
