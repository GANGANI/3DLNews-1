Twenty five years later, Maria is on a quest to understand what it means to love, mourn and remember Selena. In this intimate journey, Maria explores what Selena's legacy shows us about belonging in America.","Editors’ Notes: Mexican-American recording artist Selena Quintanilla not only popularized Tejano music to mainstream American audiences, but also helped put Latinos on the map and broke barriers of all kinds before her untimely passing in 1995. Journalist María García initially took notice of her talent when she was only seven years old. “I couldn’t articulate this when I was younger, but I felt it—a profound sense that she mattered, not just because of her music but because of her expansive cultural impact,” García tells Apple Podcasts.","On her podcast Anything for Selena, Apple Podcasts’ Show of the Year of 2021, García, who most recently served as Managing Editor for Boston public radio station WBUR, combines rigorous reporting with impassioned storytelling to honor her legacy. She also explores the indelible mark she left on Latino identity and belonging, whether it’s fatherhood, big-butt politics, and the fraught relationship with whiteness and language. Though she sees the show as a personal journey “to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” García felt it was important to make sense of how she profoundly touched the hearts and minds of many. “It’s not a biography podcast. Instead, we tried to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” she says. “So many people wrote to me telling me the storytelling in the podcast made them feel seen.\""],"nprID":null,"sources":[],"hasLanding":true,"isSource":true,"archived":false,"facebookURL":"","twitterHandle":"","syndicationURL":"","phone":"","email":"","airTimes":"","hostPhoto":null,"podcastRSS":"https://rss.wbur.org/anythingforselena/podcast","podcastItunes":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anything-for-selena/id1535265016","podcastGoogle":"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3Mud2J1ci5vcmcvYW55dGhpbmdmb3JzZWxlbmEvcG9kY2FzdA","podcastTuneIn":"","podcastSpotify":"https://open.spotify.com/show/1aCcf9CN3cunTBdkIzYTvo?si=rfPpWnCVR0KqJrwEP9MkkQ","podcastRadioPublic":"https://radiopublic.com/anything-for-selena-GZQvY9","podcastNprOne":"","podcastAzMusic":"","podcastEpisodeDesc":"","podcastUnpublish":false,"itunesType":"serial","itunesCategory":"Society \u0026 Culture","itunesSubCategory":"","itunesAuthor":"WBUR \u0026 Futuro Studios","itunesKeywords":"selena, Quintanilla, Maria Garcia, wbur, futuro"},{"comment_status":"closed","comment_count":0,"id":117,"title":"Arts \u0026 Culture","source":"arts-culture","description":"","type":"news-section","relativeURL":"/news/section/arts-culture","apiURL":"https://api.wbur.org/channels/arts-culture","externalURL":null,"miniExcerpt":"","images":{"tile":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-200x200.jpeg","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-400x400.jpeg","width":400,"height":400},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-768x768.jpeg","width":768,"height":768},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-1000x1000.jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-600x600.jpeg","width":600,"height":600},"breakout":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-1920x1920.jpeg","width":1920,"height":1920},"superbreakout":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture-2560x2560.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tile-arts-culture.jpeg","width":3000,"height":3000}},"app_banner":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_logo.png","width":1242,"height":3000}},"app_wallpaper":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Artery_pattern.png","width":1242,"height":3000}}},"content":["The ARTery is your destination for news and thoughtful conversation about Boston’s arts and culture.

Trump faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but as a first-time, white-collar offender, no prison time is necessary, and he could receive probation instead.","\u003cdiv id=\"npr-pym-nx-s1-4977352-100\" data-pym-src=\"https://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/trump-charges-20240524/summary.html\" class=\"article-section--embed\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","The jury heard from 22 witnesses during about four weeks of testimony in Manhattan’s criminal court. Jurors also weighed other evidence — mostly documents like phone records, invoices and checks to Michael Cohen, Trump’s once loyal “fixer,” who paid Daniels to keep her story of an alleged affair with the former president quiet.","The facts of the payments and invoices labeled as legal services were not in dispute. What prosecutors needed to prove was that Trump falsified the records in order to further another crime — in this case, violating the New York election law that makes it a crime for “any two or more persons [to] conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.” The jurors were able to choose whether those unlawful means were violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, falsifying tax returns or falsifying other business records.","Trump’s defense focused intently on the credibility of Cohen and argued that influencing an election is not illegal.","The verdict came more than a year after a \u003ca href=\"/npr/1164766452/trump-indictment-new-york-bragg-stormy-daniels\"\u003egrand jury indicted Trump\u003c/a\u003e on March 30, 2023, marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.","Republicans dismissed the indictment as an \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/live-updates/trump-indictment-arraignment-arrest-new-york#republican-lawmakers-continue-to-paint-the-case-against-trump-as-an-unjust-overreach\"\u003eoverreach of power\u003c/a\u003e by Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who had brought the charges. On Thursday, following the conviction, Republican elected officials quickly rallied around Trump again.","At a news conference Thursday evening, Bragg said: \"While this defendant may be unlike any other in American history, we arrived at this trial — and ultimately today at this verdict — in the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors: by following the facts and the law, and doing so without fear or favor.\"\u003cbr\u003e","\u003ch2\u003eWhat the jury heard\u003c/h2\u003e","In August 2015, two months after Trump announced his 2016 presidential bid, David Pecker, then the publisher of the \u003cem\u003eNational Enquirer \u003c/em\u003etabloid, met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower, according to testimony from Pecker and Cohen.","At that meeting, Pecker testified, it was agreed that he would be the “eyes and ears” of the Trump campaign. His job was to look out for negative stories from women that he could “take off the marketplace” by buying up the rights to the stories but never publishing them.","The plan, as Pecker outlined it, was that he would suppress these stories and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump’s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication.","Over the next year, Pecker said, he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former \u003cem\u003ePlayboy \u003c/em\u003emodel Karen McDougal. In about June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a yearlong affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened.","In early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the \u003cem\u003eAccess Hollywood \u003c/em\u003etape, where Trump could be heard boasting, “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the p****.”","The next day, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations that she'd had a sexual encounter with \u003ca href=\"/npr/1249318101/stormy-daniels-trump-trial-new-york\"\u003eTrump in 2006\u003c/a\u003e in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament.","In her testimony, Daniels said there was a “power imbalance” when, after leaving the suite’s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. That’s when, Daniels said, they had sex.","She testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show \u003cem\u003eThe Celebrity Apprentice\u003c/em\u003e. This detail — that the sex wasn’t entirely wanted — caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, “Trump knew what happened in that hotel room” and didn’t want it to come out. The adult-film actor’s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary.","As October 2016 drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after the election, it wouldn’t matter whether Daniels was paid.","This point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks testified that Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016.","Cohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid by Trump. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls that Cohen had said was made through Trump’s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster.","Still, the heart of the case rested on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization’s former comptroller, Jeff McConney.","McConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen’s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump’s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be “grossed up” to cover Cohen’s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month.","The payments would be described as pursuant to a “legal retainer.” (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump’s civil fraud trial, did not testify.)","On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal “retainers.” Nine of the checks were signed by Trump himself.","Cohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that “it was going to be one heck of a ride” in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborated that the two met in the Oval Office at the time.","The defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen’s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen’s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump’s “team.” But Costello’s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen’s lawyers he wanted to pay and that Costello was concerned about not giving “the appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,” referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump’s lawyer at the time.","\u003ch2\u003eHow this conviction could affect the 2024 election\u003c/h2\u003e","Trump has continually blasted any criminal charges he faces as “election interference” affecting his 2024 presidential campaign.","The hush money case likely is the only one of Trump’s four ongoing criminal cases that will be heard ahead of Election Day in November, since federal trials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, as well as a state case in Georgia, are in various stages of delays.","This decision in New York is likely to have rippling effects as Trump campaigns as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For now, the other 54 criminal charges he faces have not turned off potential voters, and among some Republicans, the cases have bolstered support for him. However, a conviction may not play well with independent and swing voters.","The latest \u003ca href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/novembers-presidential-election-may-2024/\"\u003eNPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll\u003c/a\u003e, from May, showed that 17% of voters surveyed said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he were convicted, while 15% said they would be more likely to vote for him. And 67% of registered voters nationally said it makes no difference to their vote if Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial.","Ian Sams, spokesperson for the White House counsel’s office, said in a statement: \"We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment.”","President Biden's campaign, however, had a longer statement. “In New York today, we saw that no one is above the law,\" said spokesperson Michael Tyler. \"There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president.\""],"nprTranscriptID":"","audio":[],"relatedLinks":[{"id":256925,"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1848/trump-hush-money-trial-34-counts","prefix":"","title":"What's Trump charged with in the hush money case?

So far that late April morning, paramedics were called to help a pregnant woman in pain, an older woman who’d fallen, an older man with trouble breathing.","“It's been nonstop all day,” Alexander Rose, a firefighter and paramedic, said just a few hours into his 24-hour shift. “This is how it is every day here.”","The job for paramedics like Rose became more taxing after flooding triggered \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/29/essex-county-storms-power-outages-flooding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ethe sudden shutdown of Norwood Hospital\u003c/a\u003e four years ago, during the early months of the COVID pandemic. The hospital was supposed to be rebuilt, but construction stalled as its operator, Steward Health Care, ran into \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/02/02/steward-health-history-deals-massachusetts-hospitals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003emounting financial problems\u003c/a\u003e and then \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/07/steward-bankruptcy-hospitals-massachusetts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003efiled for bankruptcy\u003c/a\u003e. It has yet to reopen.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","So every time first responders get called to an emergency they must drive farther — sometimes an extra 20 miles — to hospitals in other communities like Newton, Needham, Brockton and Boston. That means patients are forced to spend more time in the back of an ambulance before they reach an emergency room.","“If you have a patient who’s bleeding out, or trauma, or if there's an airway issue — it's a lot of pressure, and we definitely have to elevate ourselves and rise to the occasion,” Rose said.","Some residents drive themselves to the address of Norwood Hospital only to find it isn’t there, Rose said. Then, unsure what to do, they call 911.","\u003cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Hospital closed under unusual circumstances. But its story offers a warning now that all of Steward's facilities face an uncertain future. The Dallas-based, for-profit hospital company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month.","As Steward puts much of its business up for sale, the fate of its eight Massachusetts hospitals remains unclear. Public officials, health care workers and community advocates fear some ultimately could close — even as emergency departments across the state grapple with backlogs and long waits for care.","As Norwood reels from the loss of its community hospital, they worry other cities and towns could suffer a similar fate.","\u003cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","“It's caused a huge strain on the system,” Rose said. “It’s been tough.”","The Norwood Fire Department runs the town's 911 emergency response system, which receives about 5,000 medical calls a year. Each call takes longer than it did when Norwood Hospital was open. The longer drives, combined with wait times at emergency departments, means one medical call can tie up an ambulance for a couple hours.","\u003cspan data-index=\"4\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Fire Chief Timothy Bailey said his crews rely almost daily on mutual aid, or help from neighboring communities’ first responders. He said the absence of the local hospital is felt beyond town lines — straining fire departments across the region.","“I'd like to see that hospital rebuilt yesterday,” he said. “The delay is not helping us in any way. We'd just like to see it get done. The community needs it. We need it.”","Town officials said Norwood taxpayers are spending millions of dollars on additional costs including new ambulances — which run about $450,000 per truck — as well as vehicle maintenance, fuel and overtime.","\u003cspan data-index=\"5\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Hospital used to see around 40,000 patients in the emergency department annually, and admitted roughly 10,000, according to data the state Center for Health Information and Analysis compiled for WBUR. The hospital was profitable, according to CHIA data.","The hospital was also an economic driver for the town. It stood in the community for a century, until the rainstorm in June 2020 that sent water gushing into the building and forced the evacuation of patients.","“It was surreal,” said Joan Ballantyne, who worked as an intensive care nurse in Norwood. She recalled going to the building weeks after the flood to pick up her belongings — a spare pair of clogs, extra scrubs, a couple of books. “They went in the bin,” she said. “They all got soaked and had to be thrown out.”","The hospital’s closure displaced more than 1,000 jobs, including Ballantyne’s. She moved to a different Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, and plans to retire in the coming months.","“I certainly would have gone back [to Norwood],” she said. “I really enjoyed working there. But now, it’s too late.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"6\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Hospital was small compared to the sprawling medical centers of Boston. But emergency department nurse Kathy Reardon said it had the staff and equipment to treat heart patients who needed cardiac catheterization, something not every hospital can do.","“We had it down to a science: One, two, three, and off to the cath lab they went,” she said.","Reardon, who worked at Norwood Hospital for 32 years and now works at Steward’s Morton Hospital in Taunton, said nurses noticed that something wasn’t right with Steward’s finances several years ago. She said she had trouble ordering supplies, including paper for the electrocardiogram device that charts patients' heartbeats, and tubing needed to administer certain medications.","\u003cspan data-index=\"7\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Reardon worries about how the financial crisis at Steward will affect patients and health care workers across the state. Already, many hospitals are so crowded patients routinely receive care in emergency department hallways. Norwood’s closure only exacerbated crowding at other nearby hospitals.","The Steward hospitals “need to stay afloat,” Reardon said. “If this system crashes, it would be an absolute catastrophe for this state.”","Steward declined to comment for this story. Its landlord, Alabama-based Medical Properties Trust, or MPT, which controls the Norwood property, did not respond to a request for comment.","Gov. Maura Healey has said she wants Steward to transfer its hospitals to new owners and leave Massachusetts. Administration officials declined to comment specifically on Norwood.","In documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Steward officials laid out plans for selling their hospitals at auction over the next several weeks. But the plans didn't mention Norwood Hospital, which is currently a construction site, not a functioning medical facility.","\u003cspan data-index=\"8\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The old hospital was demolished after the flooding in 2020, and construction of a $325 million new building eventually began. But the work, led by the construction firm Suffolk, slowed down and came to a stop over the past several months as workers stopped getting paid, according to public officials.","Norwood Hospital’s website \u003ca href=\"https://www.norwood-hospital.org/OurNewHospital\"\u003estill promises\u003c/a\u003e a new building, with 130 private patient rooms, will be ready “soon.” But the construction site sits mostly empty. On a recent visit, only a few people were visible working there. The hulking steel skeleton of a building peeked through unfinished outer walls. Town officials said workers are weatherproofing the partially built structure.","“It's just such a gut-wrenching feeling to drive by that site,” said Bob Donnelly, chairman of the Norwood Board of Selectmen. “It’s a promise that has been broken.”","Years ago, Donnelly said, two of his siblings suffered cardiac arrests. Both were taken to Norwood Hospital — and recovered.","“I often wonder whether or not that would have been the case if the hospital was not there,” he said. “Even just a few minutes’ difference could have made a significant difference in their recovery.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"9\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Still, Tony Mazzucco, general manager of the town, said he’s optimistic another health care provider will see the value in Norwood Hospital, take over the site and finish the work Steward started.","“I'm confident there's going to be a hospital there,” he said. “It's just a matter of time.”","Massachusetts needs more hospital beds, Mazzucco noted.","\"The state's out of capacity,\" he said. \"Where else are you going to be able to address that capacity issue quicker than a hospital that's already 20% built?”"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":256899,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/07/steward-bankruptcy-hospitals-massachusetts","prefix":"","title":"The 3rd-largest Mass. hospital system is in bankruptcy.

And it is the first where such a law has been declared unconstitutional.","“This is an important win for educators and students in New Hampshire and sends a clear message across the country that bans on inclusive education are unconstitutional and will not stand,” Emerson Sykes, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a press release. (The ACLU’s affiliate in New Hampshire represented plaintiffs in the case.)","The New Hampshire Department of Education declined to comment on the ruling, pointing NHPR to the Attorney General’s office. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office said state officials are “currently reviewing the court’s order and will consider next steps including whether to appeal.” If the ruling is appealed, it would head to the U.S. Circuit of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston.","Here’s more details on what the ruling means, and what we know about how the law was working in practice.","\u003ch3\u003eWhat law was just declared unconstitutional?\u003c/h3\u003e","The law, called the “Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education,” was passed in 2021. Supporters for the law said it was needed to curb schools’ increased focus on training, curriculum and conversations regarding diversity, race, gender and racism.","The law prohibited educators from teaching that anyone is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, even if unconsciously. It also prohibited them from teaching that people “cannot and should not attempt to treat others without regard” to any protected legal category, such as sexual orientation, race, or mental or physical disability. Though vague in what lessons it prohibited, the stakes of the law were high: a teacher found to have violated it could lose their license.","The law mirrored policies introduced by Republicans across the country, including former President Donald Trump, who used this language in an executive order restricting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.","\u003ch3\u003eHas any teacher been charged with violating the law since it took effect?\u003c/h3\u003e","No. The New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights is responsible for investigating alleged violations of the law, and so far, it has docketed one complaint against a teacher. As of press time, this has not led to any formal violation.","The New Hampshire Department of Education also fields concerns from staff and parents that teachers might be violating the law, and in some cases the agency has conducted less official investigations into those teachers. Attorneys for the ACLU-NH argued that these inquiries, while less formal, also contributed to a chilling effect on teachers.","\u003ch3\u003eWhat was the lawsuit about?\u003c/h3\u003e","Soon after the law passed, a coalition that included teachers’ unions, LGBTQ and disability rights advocates and the ACLU-NH \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2021-12-20/nh-nea-lawsuit-aclu-divisive-concepts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003esued the state\u003c/a\u003e. They alleged that the law was so unclear that educators couldn’t understand how to comply with it. They also argued that it invited arbitrary enforcement, violating teachers’ 14th amendment protections.","In court, lawyers for that coalition argued that the law was having a chilling effect on classrooms, noting that some teachers were forgoing certain books and discussions out of fear these might run afoul of the law. This included Patrick Keefe, a high school English teacher at Campbell High School in Litchfield, who testified that he was worried he would get in trouble for lessons connecting Toni Morrison’s \"Beloved\" to contemporary issues, and Alison O’Brien, whose \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/education/2023-08-24/new-hampshire-schools-divisive-concepts-law-teacher-complaints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003elessons on the Harlem Renaissance\u003c/a\u003e unexpectedly prompted an inquiry from the education department’s misconduct investigator.","State attorneys argued that the language of the law itself, in addition to written guidance issued by the New Hampshire Attorney General, provided sufficient information on how to comply.","The judge was unconvinced by the state’s arguments, writing that while the language “may appear straightforward at first glance, their ambiguity comes to light when put into practice.”","He wrote that the resulting ambiguity puts teachers “in the untenable position of having to wager their careers on a guess or else refrain from discussing matters that implicate the banned concepts altogether.”","“This lack of clarity renders the statute unconstitutionally vague,” he added.","\u003ch3\u003eNew Hampshire Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut is one of the defendants named in the lawsuit. How did the judge interpret his role?\u003c/h3\u003e","Edelblut’s support and interpretation of the law got significant attention in the lawsuit. In his ruling, the judge pointed to op-eds that Edelblut wrote in support of the law to support his finding that it was being applied arbitrarily.","“The record demonstrates that those charged with enforcing the law have relied on Commissioner Edelblut’s personal opinions on what is appropriate instruction, as expressed in his op-ed articles, to guide their efforts,” Barbadoro wrote.","A recent investigation by NHPR and APM reports \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/education/2024-04-22/education-commissioner-frank-edelblut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003efound a similar pattern\u003c/a\u003e at the Department of Education, in which the education commissioner used his oversight powers to amplify complaints against teachers related to topics of race, racism, and LGBTQ identity.","\u003cem\u003eThis story is a production of the New England News Collaborative.

The festival is free and open to the public so you can arrive and leave whenever you'd like. There are a little less than 200 acts — many from the New England area — that will be performing throughout the day. Sets range from 30 minutes to one hour. Some bands on the lineup include Orbital Gun, a band that specializes in laid-back, trip-hop sounds, and the rock-inspired Cape Cod singer-songwriter Zion Rodman.

The reports outlined allegations of misconduct when Rollins served as Massachusetts U.S. Attorney, including trying to use the federal office to interfere in local politics.","Levy said the office is strong and the allegations did not involve the work of the U.S. Attorney's Office.","\"I won't sugar coat the events that happened,\" Levy said. \"It was a significant blow to the office when those reports came out. That being said, the tenure of the former U. S. Attorney is a smaller dot in the rear view mirror every day.\"","When Rollins stepped down last May, Levy was named \"acting\" U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. Although President Biden nominated him to the permanent post, the U.S. Senate has not voted to confirm the nomination.","\"I want to see the 'acting' taken out of my title,\" Levy said \"I'm now waiting for a Senate vote which may or may not happen.\"","An issue that has grown larger for Levy is potential risks to law enforcement officers. He mentioned a recent case where a man charged in a federal drug case allegedly said he wanted two federal prosecutors killed.","\"We live in very vitriolic times,\" Levy said. \"I would say the threats to members of law enforcement are happening across the country and it came home for us in that case. When two of our own are threatened, it was the case I thought about when I could close my eyes at night and when my eyes opened in the morning.\"","Now, Levy said, the office focuses on several issues, and prosecutes more human trafficking cases than any other U.S. Attorney's office in the nation.","The largest unit in the office is devoted to crimes involving narcotics and money laundering, addressing both the supply of drugs and the demand for them. He said drug overdose deaths in Massachusetts show the opioid epidemic is still a problem for law enforcement to address.","\"Our numbers on opioid overdose deaths are not good,\" Levy said. \"The numbers have tracked down slightly, but they're still way too high. We are going after large scale drug traffickers and we have multiple cases that have international roots, really back to Mexico.\"","Although there is growing interest in Massachusetts to allow safe injection sites, where people can use illegal drugs under medical supervision, Levy said he has not yet determined how his office might respond.","\"It's an issue that we're monitoring,\" he said. \"If and when there comes a time that we need to take a position, I can tell you it's going to be a department-wide position. This is a nationwide issue and I've been in consultation with officials within [The U.S. Department of Justice] to get educated on this topic. But we'll deal with it when it's ripe.\"","Going forward, Levy said his priorities include efforts to keep communities safe, protect children, and working on hate crimes and civil rights cases. He said he also wants to consider innovative criminal justice reforms and ways to reduce recidivism.","\"I feel very privileged to have this job,\" Levy said.\" I have the same feeling at age 58 that I did at age 35 about how lucky I am to be able to work in this office.\""],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":256906,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/05/19/rachael-rollins-resigns-us-attorney","prefix":"2023:","title":"Rachael Rollins resigns as U.S. attorney after damning accusations of 'abuse of authority'","index":1},{"id":256907,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/10/18/biden-joshua-levy-u-s-attorney","prefix":"","title":"Biden nominates Joshua Levy as permanent Massachusetts U.S. attorney","index":2}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesSeason":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"socialTease":null,"volume":3,"enableRecirculation":true,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"hideArchiveMsg":false,"disableAds":"enabled","audioDatetime":null,"taxonomy":[{"id":64,"type":"category","name":"Crime \u0026 Justice","description":"","slug":"crime-justice","series":false,"global":false,"count":12462,"hide":false,"primary":true},{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"global":false,"count":59066,"hide":false,"primary":false},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"global":false,"count":72283,"hide":false,"primary":false},{"id":75,"type":"category","name":"Politics","description":"","slug":"politics","series":false,"global":false,"count":31201,"hide":false,"primary":false}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_0429-scaled.jpg","width":3000,"height":2250,"title":"Acting U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Joshua Levy.

They quickly begin dribbling basketballs, shooting some hoops and laughing with their friends. In about 40 minutes, Polk blows a whistle to signal it's time for them to head to their homerooms.","“The morning is a great opportunity for them to get physically active prior to school,” Polk said. “The incentive to have a physical activity they’re interested in gets them in, gets them out of bed.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The effort gets some students out of bed and to class on time, but New Mission instructors say a little fitness and fun also helps kids stay in school. The high school is one of several in Boston to adopt the district's initiative to address spikes in absences, especially among older students, by adding new extracurriculars and other programs.","The district launched its \u003ca href=\"https://sites.google.com/bostonpublicschools.org/bpswintheday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\"Win the Day\" campaign\u003c/a\u003e in March, and students at New Mission say the early morning sports routine at their school has so far been well-received.","“Most of the time the gym is really packed,\" said ninth grader Jesdian Vargas, 15, as he changed out of basketball shoes to begin walking to class. \"There’s a lot of good vibe going on throughout the gym. ... It’s like a fun experience.”","\u003ch3\u003eSaturday school, check-ins and sports\u003c/h3\u003e","School leaders across the district not only wanted to improve attendance this spring semester, but also better identify why students don't show up.

Many live in households that primarily speak languages other than English, and in some cases, their families depend on them to work part-time while attending school.","McCarthy said economic hardships created by the pandemic impacted school attendance for many kids because \"they need jobs to provide for their family.\"","As part of the district campaign, schools offered weekend tutoring sessions to drop recorded absences. Students could work with a tutor to complete assignments on Saturdays, and if they worked there for at least three and a half hours, McCarthy said, they could “earn back” an absence.","Another campaign initiative called \"tag a friend\" designated some students as \"diplomats\" who were asked to call or text absent classmates to check in. Those check-in serve as a way to encourage students to come to school or offer avenues for peer support.","The district also entered partnerships with local businesses to offer kids free services as a reward for good attendance. For example, students could win an attendance “chip” to redeem at a local barbershop or salon for a free haircut.","And like New Mission High, several other schools, including Boston Community Leadership Academy-McCormack, Another Course to College and the Henderson K-12 Inclusion School, began hosting intramural sports before the start of the school day.","“Sports culture in buildings is something that’s underutilized,” McCarthy, who also used to coach basketball for the district, said. \"Sports brings so much community to our schools.”","A spokesman said the district was working to compile data on whether the pilots succeeded at improving attendance.","Still, McCarthy touted how relationship-building acts as a core focus of the campaign, improving how districts take a greater interest in students' lives by asking peers and staffers to reach out more to students and their families — or even conduct home visits to find out what families need.","\u003cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","At an \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xd9gcheEvE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eApril school committee meeting\u003c/a\u003e, Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper lauded the efforts and stressed the importance of improving attendance among district students.","“We're tapping in, incentivizing with kids, but also making connection with the parents,” she said, adding, “This is one of the biggest issues nationally, statewide, and with us that we just, we have to continue to work on.”","Skipper said the district wants to expand the pilot to more schools in September, noting that it began with Region 8 schools to identify which strategies work and which don't.","\u003ch3\u003ePrizes for good attendance\u003c/h3\u003e","At the Boston Community Leadership Academy-McCormack in Dorchester, school counselor Justine Grace paced around before delivering morning announcements on a rainy Tuesday last month. She explained that many students miss school for a variety of reasons. Some have to help with family matters, she said, acting as translators at medical appointments or helping with child care at home. Others have long distances to travel to campus.","\"It could be they have to take two trains, two buses,\" to reach the school, Grace said.","\u003cspan data-index=\"4\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The school serves students in the seventh to 12th grade, and its ninth graders struggle the most with attendance.","In the spirit of the \"Win the Day\" pilot, the school organized a raffle this month to award prizes, like movie tickets or field trips, for good attendance.","The effort clicked for 15-year-old Essence Loving, a ninth grader, who said she came to school more often to win a class field trip to Apex, an arcade-type entertainment complex and also to receive a “perfect attendance award.”","\"Kids want to come to school and have fun,\" Grace said. \"It's a social aspect, and we know it's academic driven, but we need to figure out other ways to get them in the building.\"","Ninth grader Nathalie Medina said her attendance improved since January after she sat with the school counselor and figured out why she was struggling: it was a matter of adjusting her morning routine and waking up earlier. They formed an attendance contract.","“I was slacking off really bad last year,” Medina said. “I love school and having motivation, and like people [caring] about me being present made me want to come even more.”","Plus, she said if she was late or didn’t come to school, her younger brother in the grade below hers wouldn’t either.","“He would have to wait for me, and that affected him, too,” Medina said. “So he also motivated me to get here on time so that I don't mess up his education.”"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":256778,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/21/massachusetts-chronically-absent-students","prefix":"","title":"State reports decline in chronically absent students","index":1},{"id":256779,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/10/24/massachusetts-chronic-absenteeism-student-data","prefix":"","title":"Mass. students are absent from school at 'staggering' rates, says state education official","index":2},{"id":256780,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/01/10/chronic-absenteeism-massachusetts-education-secretary","prefix":"","title":"State education secretary takes to airwaves with a message: make school attendance ‘a priority’","index":3}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2024-05-28 06:35:00","broadcastTime":"06:35:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesSeason":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"socialTease":null,"volume":3,"enableRecirculation":true,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"hideArchiveMsg":false,"disableAds":"enabled","audioDatetime":"1716895358","taxonomy":[{"id":200,"type":"tag","name":"WBUR's Morning Edition","description":"Local content from WBUR's Morning Edition broadcasts","slug":"morning-edition","series":false,"global":false,"count":6162,"hide":true,"primary":true},{"id":66,"type":"category","name":"Education","description":"","slug":"education","series":false,"global":false,"count":6870,"hide":false,"primary":true},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"global":false,"count":72283,"hide":false,"primary":false},{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"global":false,"count":59066,"hide":false,"primary":false}],"audio":[{"id":131525,"createdAt":"2024-05-28T11:22:38.000000Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-28T11:22:39.000000Z","fileName":"news_0528_massachusetts-chronic-absenteeism-students-pilot-program","playCount":0,"airDate":"2024-05-28","source":"news","wordpressTitle":"In Boston, schools test ways to target student absences with sports, raffles and Saturday schedules","wordpressSlug":"massachusetts-chronic-absenteeism-students-pilot-program","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":273,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Boston Public Schools' new campaign to tackle absenteeism seeks to reward students for improved attendance while identifying why some kids \"chronically\" miss school.","megaphoneID":"9728ccf4-1ce4-11ef-8110-e32078135263","megaphoneURL":"https://traffic.megaphone.fm/BUR3124074175.mp3","articleAPIURL":"https://api.wbur.org/stories?id=939360\u0026org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"https://api.wbur.org/audio/131525","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":4374182,"url":"https://traffic.megaphone.fm/BUR3124074175.mp3"}}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":939360,"type":"caption","attributes":{"id":"attachment_939369","align":"alignnone","width":"3000","alttext":"Physical education and health teacher Shawn Polk tells students the day's intramural sports program session is over and its time for the kids to get to class.

We have a lack of creative civic pride,” she says. “If we're going to define ourselves by these big words — world class, champions, innovators — we have to remember that the arts are the grandparents of all of that excellence.”\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eThis piece has been excerpted from a conversation, and edited for length and clarity. – Cloe Axelson and Kate Neale Cooper\u003c/em\u003e","____","\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I don’t want people to just look at art. I want them to live in it\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e","We live in a world where we're measured by our accolades and affiliations — and that sometimes devalues our creativity and imagination. Too many of us think of art as something we did when we were kids. But we were all born into this world as creative beings. And we have opportunities to be creative every day. Creativity lives in the choices we make — which phone we buy, which pen we use, what clothes we wear. It’s how we express our feelings and emotions. We literally live in art.","And when we recognize that, the urgency of supporting and embracing the arts, demanding more art, requiring art, becomes much more intense and a responsibility. I don’t want people to just look at art. I want them to live in it.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","If the art is music, that means getting up out of your seat and dancing. It's okay to frolic in the grass. It's okay to roll around. It's okay to dance in a historical space that has never invited you in. People have to be given permission to be themselves. And in Boston that has been dictated by the institutions that have historically influenced and shaped where we go and what we do to have fun.","The thing I want to see is more creative freedom. The freedom to be yourself, the freedom to express yourself, the freedom to connect with people in a way that isn’t limited by your title or affiliations. But just to be human \u0026mdash; with all of humanity’s amazing possibilities \u0026mdash; especially in a city like Boston.","____","\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Art doesn't hurt our city. It transforms our city.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e","I'm a public servant to the arts. But the work that I'm doing is around systems change, because the system we’re working with is broken. The permitting process is a good example. When it comes to allowing, accepting and encouraging creative pursuits that would truly help our city look different and feel different, we block that process and representation. We pride ourselves on being an innovative, world-class city, but then we throw up barriers like this grueling process to get a permit for an arts project.","We treat the arts like a construction project. Folks have to be willing to not just come to the table, but to sit in a different chair at that table. We need a new perspective: Art doesn't hurt our city. It transforms our city.","Look at\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/06/23/rose-kennedy-greenway-rob-problak-gibbs-breathe-life-together\"\u003e Rob Gibbs’ mural on the Rose Kennedy Greenway\u003c/a\u003e. That was a huge win. But it took years to get it there. We need more large-scale murals that cover our city like a blanket. Public art actually gives more people a reason to visit, it centers belonging, it drives foot traffic for small businesses, maybe even gets people to move here. But if there isn’t a desire to have a radical public representation and discourse about art, then we’re just a pass-through city that embellishes who we are. And I’m not going to stand for that.","\u003cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Every iteration of the festival is a new generation of artists\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e","I would definitely say I’m a hype woman — I’m Boston’s hype woman. I grew up going to Skippy White's, Nubian Ocean, Funky Fresh Records, Mattapan Records, Tower Records and Cheapo Records. Those places were our Starbucks. We saw movies at the theater in Copley Center and hanging out at Downtown Crossing was a big thing.","That's the Boston I remember \u0026mdash; and I work very hard to pay homage to it by integrating that sense of belonging that I grew up with, into BAMS Fest.","At least once a summer as a kid, I'd get up at 6:00 a.m. with my family and go over to American Legion Highway, where the outdoor grills were. By noon or 1:00 p.m. when the cookout started, people from different parts of the neighborhood would start stopping by. I saw old friends and made new ones. I found out about folks I didn't even realize I was related to. That dedication to holding space to break bread with friends and family — and even strangers — is something I wanted to bring into the festival experience.","When I was a kid, community centers hosted lots of talent shows. You wanted to see the best from every neighborhood, so you could go home and work hard to be better than those guys at the next show. People validated your creativity through these shows: If you got the loudest applause, you had bragging rights for the year. I wanted to bring that excitement, that inspiration to BAMSFest. Every iteration of the festival is a new generation of artists, and there's someone in the audience — young, established or mid-career — that gets inspired and thinks, “I want to be on that stage.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"instagram\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Growing up, there was this store at Blue Hill Avenue and Moreland Street, a corner bodega. It had everything you needed, but also the owners were folks you knew and they knew you. They watched out for the kids and helped families get through difficult times. Small businesses are an integral part of our growth and development as a community and a city, and that’s another element that I wanted to bring to this festival.","____","\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"We’ve got artist collectives, jam sessions, circus arts, a street dance community and street art\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e","I've never heard the word soul associated with our city and that frustrates me.

Article 97 therefore does not apply to it,\" says \u003ca href=\"https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2023/11/2023-2029%20OSRP_single%20page%20view.pdf\"\u003ethe city's response\u003c/a\u003e.","In a memorandum responding to the plaintiff's motion to temporarily halt the project \u0026mdash; which was \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/03/25/white-stadium-lawsuit-ruling\"\u003eultimately denied in March\u003c/a\u003e \u0026mdash; Boston Unity Soccer Partners took another approach to the argument about the Constitutional amendment.","The \u003ca href=\"https://media.wbur.org/wp/2024/05/66578fa5839e1.pdf.pdf.pdf\"\u003ecompany's memorandum\u003c/a\u003e claims the \"bureaucratic process\" of obtaining a two-thirds vote from the Legislature to comply with Article 97 is \"rife with delay\" \u0026mdash; and ultimately \"it is all process...without meaningful substance.\"","\"The inherent delays alone plainly needed to go through these two additional layers of process at the state level \u0026mdash; bureaucratic (in the [Executive Office of Environmental Affairs]) and both branches of the Massachusetts Legislature - 'will kill this Project,'\" the document says.","\u003ch3\u003eWhat's next\u003c/h3\u003e","Boston Unity Soccer Partners are under pressure to secure a stadium, after they were awarded one of two new franchises in 2023 by the National Women's Soccer League to establish a professional team in greater Boston.

Wu said the city plans to use $50 million of public funds to fix the structure, with an additional minimum $30 million from the soccer team to complete renovations.","\"The city has indicated that there is $50 million dollars available for this purpose,\" says \u003ca href=\"https://media.wbur.org/wp/2024/05/66578f33630dc.pdf.pdf.pdf\"\u003ea letter from the Emerald Necklace Conservancy\u003c/a\u003e sent Monday to Boston City Hall. \"The neighborhood groups and organizations that signed onto the attached Statement of Principles would like to partner with the city to renovate the stadium for the Boston Public School athletes and the general public.

That's until a colleague recently sent a photo of a rare species of wild garlic to Grace Glynn, a botanist with the Fish and Wildlife Department.","\"When I opened up the photo that she had sent, there was this little weird plant in the corner of the frame. And when I zoomed in, I immediately knew that it was\u003cem\u003e Floerkea,\u003c/em\u003e that it was false mermaid-weed,\" Glynn said. \"I couldn't believe that I was finally seeing this plant.\"","Glynn said she’s been looking for the plant for years, to no avail. It hasn’t been spotted in any of the handful of areas where it had historically been identified and collected.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The new population spans both public and private land along a slow-moving river in Addison County — a completely separate river from where the plant had previously been recorded.","Glynn said the newly discovered population may comprise of thousands of the plants. When she went to survey the area, she found them amid stands of ostrich ferns and the rare wild garlic species that helped lead to the finding.","Because the plant is a spring ephemeral, this discovery couldn't have come at a more opportune time.","\"The thing about \u003cem\u003eFloerkea\u003c/em\u003e, or false mermaid-weed, is that it's only visible for about four to six weeks every year,” Glynn said. “So if you're out in the place at the wrong time of year, you could just walk by it, and there would be nothing there. It would just be seeds on the ground.\"","The plant is unique because not only is it a spring ephemeral, but it’s also an annual. This means it carries out a full life cycle — germination, flowering, setting seed and dying — all in one season. Glynn said the plant makes very small, delicate blossoms and drops spiky, football-shaped seeds.","“If you crouch down in the floodplain right now, you'll notice that the ground is just carpeted with these little spiky fruits. And it was so cool to see that. You know, I've never seen that in Vermont,” Glynn said.","It’s also the only species of the family \u003cem\u003eLimnanthaceae\u003c/em\u003e, or meadowfoam, in the Northeast.","According to Glynn, the last botanist to record the plant in Vermont was Nellie Flynn, who contributed to the Pringle Herbarium at the University of Vermont.","“It was just amazing to touch this plant and to think, ‘Oh, Nellie Flynn was probably the last person to ever touch this species in Vermont back in 1916,’\" Glynn said. “And I always think about how there are just these threads through history that kind of tie you to other botanists, and it just adds depth and richness, I think, to an already rich story.”","Glynn said the amount of plants in the area indicates that there could be more populations of the species downstream. She plans to survey more areas, but some of that might have to wait for next year — the plant only blooms for about a month before withering away.","____","\u003cem\u003eThis story is a production of the New England News Collaborative.

Wade — that the court should reconsider other rulings, including its previous rulings on same-sex marriage.","“I think that was quite a shocking and startling statement in a concurring opinion where the issue was not even before the court,” Marshall said. “This was the first time, I believe, in the history of our constitutional democracy, where a right had been recognized, expanding existing rights ... and then had been taken away.”","While she thinks Massachusetts is unlikely to roll back its law on gay marriage, Marshall said the U.S. is still one nation with one Supreme Court.","“And if the United States Supreme Court chose to reexamine the question, it would have profound implications for the rest of the country, even Massachusetts,” she said.","Moreover, Marshall said those implications could go beyond gay marriage and abortion.","“I think what I'm more concerned about is a nationwide jurisprudence that says once you have secured a right, a later court can take away that.”","Marshall said other important legal issues are now facing the LGBTQ+ community, including whether people can refuse services — or even health care — based on sexual orientation or gender identity.","“This is a civil right. It's not a religious right. And when you have religious claims saying, ‘I don't have to have anything to do with that,’ saying, \u003cstrong\u003e'\u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to offer accommodation to a same sex couple,\u003cstrong\u003e'\u003c/strong\u003e I would think that that was not tolerable in the United States, but apparently that could be an open question.”","Marshall said many categories of civil rights, like same-sex marriage, are vulnerable to state political systems.","While Massachusetts judges are appointed until retirement, many other states elect their judges. That means political forces can affect court rulings.","“That fundamentally undermines having an independent judiciary, because if you worry that you're going to be voted off or not re-appointed, you cannot come at every case with a truly independent mind.”","Marshall hopes she would have made the same ruling on same-sex marriage regardless. But, she said, \"Many, many people criticized the decision. Many, many people criticized me. Had I had to go through a re-appointment or re-election process, I'm not sure that I would have been reappointed or re-elected.”","Marshall worries that electoral systems in other states could keep some good lawyers off the bench. Prior to becoming a judge, she said she liked her job as a general counsel for Harvard University. She said she might've stayed there “if I had thought that, yes, I could be appointed to the Supreme Judicial Court, but I might be out of a job in six years time if I make difficult, independent decisions.”","____","\u003cem\u003eThis story was republished as part of the New England News Collaborative.

Prior to falling in love with public radio, Amanda was a print reporter at newspapers around New England, including the storied Foster’s Daily Democrat.","When she's not cutting audio or scripting interviews, Amanda enjoys being outside, cooking, and caring for her large collection of houseplants.

The bus would pick us up at 6:20","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eNobody really was that chatty at that hour of the morning, but Cedric was even quieter than the rest.","\u003cstrong\u003eCornell Cannon:\u003c/strong\u003e He wasn't an outgoing, friendly person, you know, he'll clearly talk if talked to, and, you know, join in a crowd or conversation and everything, but not much ...","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eCornell told me Cedric was kind of a nerd. Into \"Star Wars,\" comic books. He didn't play sports like Cornell — who was voted most athletic at Lynnfield High. Cedric didn't even bother submitting a photo to the yearbook or any description under his name.","\u003cstrong\u003eCornell Cannon: \u003c/strong\u003eHe would be in the nerds because we had brainiacs, nerds, jocks and burnouts. So, within all of those, he would fit into the nerd.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAfter their graduation in 1985, Cornell and Cedric didn't see each other much. Until their 30th reunion at the Kowloon, that Route 1 institution in Saugus, Mass.","Cornell was surprised Cedric showed up. He was glad to see him.","\u003cstrong\u003eCornell Cannon:\u003c/strong\u003e We did the typical, \"Hey, so what are you doing today? What's going on with you?\" He's like, \"Well, I actually work at Harvard Medical School.\"","I'm like, Harvard? He's like, no, no, no, not like that. I work at, you know, um, and he said something referring to like basically a mortician, basically.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe title on the business card Cedric handed Cornell said \"morgue manager.\" And despite Cedric's protests, Cornell was still impressed. I mean it's Harvard!","\u003cstrong\u003eCornell Cannon:\u003c/strong\u003e You worked your way up and, you know, I'm saying that to him, like, hey, here we were, like, little snotty nose boys in the hood.","You know, I hope this doesn't sound morbid or anything like that, but, you know, I've always been interested in what happens when an autopsy is performed and he's like, well, you know, and I forget his exact words, but he's like,  you know, it's not that interesting, but the way I took that was because he lives with it and deals with it daily for his work. Just kind of like, yeah, you know, that's the work I do.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eCedric spent more than half his life at Harvard, almost 30 years. His job was in the anatomical gift program – a fancy way to refer to the department that handled body donation.","He had two bosses – they're the ones who enrolled people, spoke to donors and their families and coordinated delivery of the bodies after death.","Cedric's job was more behind the scenes. Grunt work. Keeping the lab clean and neat. Moving the bodies from the basement morgue to the anatomy lab on the top floor. Placing the bodies on the stainless steel tables, where they’d sometimes stay for the entire semester. Then, preparing the bodies for cremation.","For decades, it seems like Cedric did the job with little issue. Students barely noticed him. He was like a ghost. Doing his job, but rarely seen.","Medical students today learn about the human body the same way doctors did when Harvard Medical School was founded almost 250 years ago: on dead people.","Before they go to care for living patients, medical students need to know everything about how the human body works. To do that, they need to get a look inside.","Mary Barton walked into Harvard's anatomy lab for the first time in 1987. She was one of about 100 students, each looking down on a zipped-up bag that contained the person they would get to know intimately over the next few months.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Mary Barton:\u003c/strong\u003e There's the smell of formaldehyde, which is kind of strong, and so, you know, that's another worry, is like, am I gonna gag? You know, we wore masks, and gowns, and gloves.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eMany schools refer to donors as medical students' \"first patients.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Mary Barton:\u003c/strong\u003e It felt to me like a bit of a threshold to cross, because here we were students, we were just like, you know, 22-year-old kids, and we were being invited into a profession. And this was kind of the first step in training for that profession.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe woman who donated her body to Harvard taught Dr. Barton lessons she couldn’t learn from a textbook. How the human body worked, but also what it means to be a doctor. How to give care and respect to another person, even a dead one. Throughout her career, Dr. Barton carried an appreciation for that unnamed woman who she’ll never really know.","After the break, we get into Harvard.","____","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThere may be no better brand than Harvard. It holds this special place in our culture.","\u003cstrong\u003eScene from \"Legally Blonde\":\u003c/strong\u003e You got into Harvard Law? What, like it's hard?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eShorthand for elite, upper crust, high class.","\u003cstrong\u003eScene from \"With Honors\":\u003c/strong\u003e I'm a bum. But bear in mind, I'm a Harvard bum.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe utmost rigor, and the highest echelon.","\u003cstrong\u003eScene from \"Good Will Hunting\":\u003c/strong\u003e This is a Harvard bar, huh? I thought they'd be like equations and shit on the wall.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eFor some, it's seen as a reputation well earned. Their alumni sit on the Supreme Court, in the Oval Office, in Fortune 100 boardrooms. Their incoming freshmen classes are filled with the smartest graduates from high schools across the world. Same goes for the medical school. These are students who spend the summer playing piano at Carnegie Hall and launching startups. And this is just what these kids do for fun.","Harvard has a piggy bank of more than $50 billion to play with. Billion, with a B. The biggest endowment of any university in the world. Bigger than the GDP of some small countries.","Harvard is also a business. Yes, there’s hundreds of faculty doing important research and writing, but someone also has to empty the trash and answer the phones and move the bodies so the super smart med students can learn anatomy.","Unique to Harvard, I’m told, is an extreme culture of independence.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Levy:\u003c/strong\u003e The slogan in Harvard is, \"Each tub on its own bottom.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e Each tub on its own bottom?","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Levy:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. That's, that's kind of a motto within Harvard.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003ePaul Levy spent three years as executive dean for administration — basically the chief operating officer of Harvard Medical School. The motto is actually \"every tub on its own bottom.\" And it came from a 17th-century Christian allegory co-opted by a Harvard president 200 years later. Which … of course it did.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Levy:\u003c/strong\u003e It basically suggests that each school, whether the medical school or the business school, or each department within a school, or each lab, or each office, is expected to be self-reliant.","While there is, clearly a central administration and there are clearly centralized standards of conduct, the degree to which there is oversight and compliance is probably variable.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eI was glad to get Paul Levy on tape, by the way. I reached out to a lot of students and staff, both current and former. Only a handful of people agreed to talk to me. And even fewer would talk on the record.","There's this fear of going against Harvard publicly. You do not speak out of turn. Because, as one person told me, as a physician especially, if you don't already have some kind of connection to Harvard — through your research or a faculty appointment — you want that connection. Why risk your career by talking to a reporter?","Maybe you're thinking — well, isn't it like this at any fancy institution? No, I'm told. Not even its peers, like Yale or Penn. There is something just different about Harvard. Maybe it's because Harvard is literally 140 years older than the United States. Or the fact that its alumni are in positions of power all over the world. Whatever it is, Harvard makes its own rules. For better or worse.","And Cedric, in the basement morgue, beneath some of the most elite medical classrooms in the world \u0026mdash; he starts making his own rules, too.","In 2018, he started bringing work home.","I should say now, nearly everything I am going to describe from here on out comes from court records and with a giant \"alleged\" in front of it. Only four people pled guilty to any of the crimes I'm going to detail. Cedric's pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial in August.","So it's 2018, just a couple of years after that reunion where Cedric brushed off his old classmate's interest in autopsies.","Cedric starts stealing from work. Stealing donors. Or parts of donors. He is carving up the bodies of people in the morgue, and taking parts of them home.","Flesh. Skulls. Brains. Bones. Human remains.","This goes on for at least four years. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of body parts. Hundreds of donor bodies that came to the morgue during this time.","There are so many questions I have. What made him want to start doing this?","Did he do it for the money, or because he was into this odd world? Or both?","How long did he think about doing this, before he sliced into that first donor and took part of them home?","When did he do this? Did he stay late, or come in early, before anyone was around? Did he worry that someone would walk in and see him hunched over a dead body peeling out organs?","Or was he left alone so often that he really didn't have to worry about getting caught?","It's especially hard for me to understand how nobody at Harvard knew that this was happening. It was right under their nose. For years.","The man drove to work in an orange Subaru with a license plate that read \"GRIM-R\" — as in, Grim Reaper. He was stealing body parts, and nobody knew.","The people in charge at Harvard aren't talking. Not to me, not to anyone publicly. They pulled together an outside panel to review the anatomical gift program — but the report didn't focus on what went wrong with Cedric. Instead, it just reviewed the current program and made suggestions for improvement. Like, checking for \"unusual incidents\" such as someone using their key card after hours. And doing a better job at inventory and \"reconciliation\" of donors. And doing a more thorough job confirming that the body is complete before it goes off for cremation. That these recommendations were even made, suggests that none of these checks were in place when Cedric was there.","So Cedric is bringing home body parts. He's the supplier. His wife, Denise, seems to have taken it from there, handling logistics. She’s the one who communicates with the buyers and goes to the post office. She takes the payments through her PayPal account.","In September 2018, an antiques dealer starts sending money to Denise. A lot of money.","A thousand dollars with the memo: \"head number 7.\"","Two hundred dollars with the memo, \"braiiiiiins.\" That's with six lowercase i's.","All in, he will PayPal her 39 times, for a total of more than $37,000.","This wasn't just an online business, though. Cedric allegedly invited people into the morgue to essentially shop for parts.","He'd let them browse the donor bodies and choose which they were most interested in. This piece of skin, that skullcap, that arm. Then one of them would slice into the body, take what they wanted and leave.","In October 2020, the peak of the COVID pandemic, Harvard would have been deserted. Classes were still remote. There were no anatomy labs happening. Cedric invited a buyer onto campus. They met at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday. She took home two dissected faces, at the price of $600.","The shopping trips seemed to have raised no red flags for anyone at Harvard.","That is, until June 2022\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e Some 400 miles away in central Pennsylvania, there's a break in the case.","A woman went into her basement to where her husband kept his work. She found a couple of five-gallon buckets there. She looked inside. I talked with Cumberland County District Attorney Seán McCormack about what she discovered","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e What was found, what was it like down there?","\u003cstrong\u003eSeán McCormack:\u003c/strong\u003e Um, uh, uh (sighs). You know, it's hard to describe.","There were, there were body parts, many of them separated by, by body parts, eyeballs and, and different other body parts. So, um, just in, in different types of buckets and stuff like that.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHuman body parts. Investigators cataloged two brains, a heart, a kidney, a spleen, a skull with hair, two livers, six pieces of skin and fat, a trachea, two lungs, and the jawbone of a child – with teeth.","\u003cstrong\u003eSeán McCormack:\u003c/strong\u003e I've been a prosecutor for 34 years and the vast majority of that time I was a child abuse prosecutor so I have seen a lot of things over the years. But that being said, it is one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen","The man's arrest in August 2022 got some attention \u0026mdash; mostly from local news.","\u003cstrong\u003eNews reel:\u003c/strong\u003e New at 5. Police arrested a man from Pennsylvania's mid-state for allegedly buying body parts through Facebook.","\u003cstrong\u003eNews reel:\u003c/strong\u003e Police later conducted a search warrant collecting three to five buckets, determined by investigators to include human brains, a heart kidney, and more.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eBut what we didn’t know then … that call that woman made to the police about what was in her basement pulled the first thread that unraveled a much bigger and more shocking story. It wasn’t just one weird guy and his buckets of body parts. His arrest exposed a nationwide network of human remains trading that would upend the lives of hundreds of families and ensnare the world’s most prestigious medical school.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e This part is what kills me. I was, um, walking out my door, and it was my oldest son's last day of second grade.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's June 14, 2023. Amber Haggstrom is outside her house in Epping, New Hampshire, waiting for her oldest son to come home from school. Her two younger boys are next her. One of them is holding a little graduation sign for his big brother. A Carvel ice cream cake is inside thawing on the counter.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e And so I'm going out to the driveway, and that's our bus stop. And then, so, um, all of a sudden I'm getting this package. And I'm like, oh, what is this? And then it's labeled Harvard on top.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAmber's mom had donated her body to Harvard three years earlier.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I was like, oh wow, I'm getting a nice thank you letter for my mom's donation for, you know, to the medical school. I'm like, oh this is nice, you know, something. And then I opened it up and I read the first couple lines, and I almost dropped to the ground.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIn language that is precise and dry, the letter told Amber that Cedric Lodge had been arrested for the unlawful interstate transport of stolen human remains.

We're talking about dead bodies here. Take care while listening. \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's a couple of weeks before Halloween, and I'm driving around a New Hampshire suburb.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eIt's a very cute neighborhood. Every house has some pumpkins in the front yard.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are lots of kids here — I can tell by the bicycles piled up in the driveways and swing sets in the yards. It's the kind of neighborhood that seems perfect for trick-or-treating. I can imagine the swarms of kids traipsing around in costumes in just a few weeks.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eThis house has a 12-foot skeleton in front of it, a skeleton with sunglasses on waving from the front porch.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eSpooky season is in full swing here. Almost every single house is decked out for the holiday.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eThere's no shortage of Halloween in this neighborhood. If you wanted to get away from it, there's not much way to do that.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm here to meet with Amber Haggstrom. She's the woman you met at the end of the last episode. She got the letter from Harvard as she waited outside for her son to get off the bus.","It's been almost exactly four months since that day in June. The day the thefts at Harvard were exposed to the world.","\u003cstrong\u003eNews reel: \u003c/strong\u003eProsecutors say a morgue at Harvard became a macabre marketplace for heads, brains, skin, bones, and other body parts. The accused grisly shopkeeper? Morgue manager Cedric Lodge.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eCedric Lodge's alleged scheme went on for at least four years. He's facing federal charges — along with others accused of taking part in the nationwide body parts network.","And while that kicked off a flurry of news coverage and court proceedings and PR cleanup from Harvard, the news of the thefts caused something much more profound for people like Amber and the other families of donors.","It interrupted their grief. It reopened wounds that had just begun to heal.","When their loved ones died, they knew what to do. They could follow that well-trod path of grief. Routines and rituals. Wakes and funerals.","Others knew how to respond: \"I'm so sorry for your loss.\"","They got their loved one's ashes back and put them on a shelf or scattered them on a beach. They said goodbye again.","There was a finality to death. The questions were answered. Their loved one was gone. They knew what happened.","At least, they thought they did.","My name is Ally Jarmanning. And this is \u003cem\u003eLast Seen: Postmortem\u003c/em\u003e, the series about the bodies — the people — stolen from Harvard Medical School.","Episode 2: The victims.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003e Hi, how are you? It's so nice to meet you.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Nice to meet you.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eYour neighborhood is so cute.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Aw, thank you. It's great for the kids.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAmber's house is dedicated to her family — photos from family trips are on the walls and shelves are filled with her kids' books. Dirt bike helmets are piled by the back door. She sent her husband and the boys to visit the grandparents today so we could talk.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eAlso, I can't believe how neat your house is for having three boys.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh, I worked on it a lot yesterday.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, very clear that boys live here, but, um.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, oh, well, for sure. It's never ever this clean. No.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm here to talk to Amber about her mom, Donna Pratt. It's hard to sum up Donna. She was doting grandmother.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Everything that the kids wanted to do, she would do. She would totally get down to their level.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAn avid thrifter. A devout Catholic. A road tripper.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e We even did a trip to Canada, Niagara Falls, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, everywhere.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eA crafter. A gardener. She could do basic electrical work and car maintenance.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e She used to even take out her oil pans and she'd be like, come on, Amber, I'm going to go and teach you how to change the oil now.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eShe found it hard to throw anything away.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e She was like, there could be a time where I need this.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd Amber can't bring herself to get rid of anything of her mom's. She still has her toolbox. The Christmas tree skirt she made. The baby blanket her mom never finished.","Amber and Donna were incredibly close. Even through those teenage years where mothers and daughters can butt heads.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e She was a single mom. Pretty much my whole life growing up it was just me and her.","When I was growing up, she always said, I'm going to focus on you, and I'm not going to have a boyfriend and I'm not going to remarry. I'm going to focus your whole life and just everything was about me and how I grew up.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eDonna, on her hairdresser's salary, always made sure Amber had what she needed. Plus had some fun. On road trips, Donna would be at the wheel of her 1989 Cutlass Supreme, Amber in the passenger seat helping navigate.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Everything was just always an experience. Everything with her. She was so knowledgeable in so many different ways.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eShe made your life a lot bigger.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e A lot bigger. A lot bigger.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIn 2015, Donna got sick. Lung cancer, the doctors said. She'd never even smoked.","Amber and her husband fixed up their basement to make room for Donna as she went through treatment. It was such a comfort to Amber to have Donna just downstairs. And her sons loved having their babcha so close.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e They would go downstairs, have movie time, popcorn. They would bake cookies together. They would, oh my gosh, do everything. And read, my mom loved to read to them.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThere was a lot of joy in the house during those years. But also the realities of illness. Doctor's visits, treatment, surgery. And discussions about what would happen after Donna died.","Donna had a plan: She wanted to donate her body to Harvard Medical School. Of course, she couldn't help but make a little joke about it.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e She never fully graduated high school. So, she was like, why not just go straight to Harvard? So that's what she did. She graduated from Fazio's Hairdressing School. And then after that she goes straight to Harvard.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIt was like Donna to make a plan like this. Funerals are expensive, even the cheap ones. She didn't want to burden anyone, even after death.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e So there was no doubt in her mind that she was like, this is what I'm doing. I want to give back. And then she was like, you know, this is my body. She was like, obviously, I want it cherished. This is me. But if I can give back to students, she was like, I would love to. There was no doubt in her mind. And especially she had her, a full trust in Harvard as well, complete trust.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eFor five years, Donna dealt with her illness the same way she managed all the other difficult periods in her life — with determination, and laughter. Even when the tumors started to take over.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e We're leaving the hospital and they said, \"OK, you have to get in touch with hospice,\" and that hit me like a ton of bricks because when you say the word hospice, you know that there's not too much time left. But we're walking out of that hospital, my mom was laughing. She was like, I'm going to teach them.","But as the weeks progressed, you could start noticing a change.","She wasn't getting up in the morning like she normally would. Then she slowed down on eating. She slowed down on drinking.","And then it got to the point where she couldn't shower on her own. I bathed her. I washed her hair. I didn't mind it. I did not mind taking care of her at all. Obviously, I felt sad inside. But she did all of that for me when I was, you know, growing up, and she would do anything in her power to be there for me and to do things for me, so I'm returning the favor.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eTheir last night together, Amber fed her mom her favorite meal: haddock, and a little bit of ginger ale. She slept that night beside Donna.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I got up, and I looked at the clock, and I looked over at my mom, and I noticed my mom's breathing was very, very shallow. And it was early in the morning, and I stood up, I put my hand on my mom, and I looked at her, and I said, \"Mom.\" She stopped breathing right then and there.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe grief crushed her, yet the knowledge of where Donna would go next — to Harvard — was a small solace for Amber.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Knowing what she was going to be doing with her body afterwards gave me comfort because I knew that she was going to be having her body go to the advancement of science and I was very excited for that, for her wishes to be fulfilled. And like mom are going to be a part of something very big for, you know, younger generation's future.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHarvard kept Donna's body for two years. In that time, Amber had a third baby, another boy. She read her sons books Donna had gotten them. She planted a garden with her mom's favorite flowers: hibiscus, a rose bush, a giant lilac.","In 2022, she finally got a call from Harvard saying her mom's remains were ready to be picked up. She asked the staffer on the phone: What did the students learn from my mother? That's confidential, the person told her.","Donna's ashes showed up in a black box, a gold seal taped on the opening. It felt like the return of something she'd been missing.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Having her back, it was very, very comforting. Very comforting. I felt like I had my mom back in a way, even though she couldn't talk back, but I could still talk to her. And even though I definitely believe in a spirit and an afterlife, but still having her with me brought a lot of closure that I really desperately needed.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eShe put her mom on top of the fridge, close by, but out of the way of her rambunctious boys. She tucked the box behind the jar filled with her mom's hot cocoa mix, her favorite drink. She'd tell her mom about her new job working at a florist shop, the stress of balancing home with work.","Donna's ashes stayed there, above her daughter's head in the kitchen, for more than a year.","Then the letter from Harvard came in June, telling Amber about what Cedric Lodge was accused of doing. Donna had arrived at Harvard in February 2020 and her cremated remains were returned in 2022. Donna was at Harvard, right smack dab in the middle of when Cedric Lodge was allegedly picking apart bodies.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I read the first couple lines and I almost dropped to the ground. I thought I was going to throw up.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eShe read the letter as she stood at the end of her driveway, waiting for her oldest son, Mack, to get off the school bus. It was his last day of second grade. Her two younger boys stood next to her, one with a little sign for his big brother. It was supposed to be a happy day.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I literally took this paper and like threw it. And I just was, I was on the verge of fainting and I'm like, oh my God. I'm like, my worst fears are coming true.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe yellow school bus rounded the corner. And she tried to channel her mom's strength.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I'm bawling my eyes out, wiping my tears away. I'm like, Amber, put this all aside for now. You'll figure this out later. You need to focus on Mack. He gets off the bus, I run up to him, give him a huge hug and say I'm so proud of you for your second year of school and now you're going to be on to the third grade. I'm so proud of you buddy. But inside I am shattered, absolutely shattered with what I just read.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eLater, Amber watched the news.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e And I'm like, oh my God. I'm like, this has to do with Harvard. I should probably pay attention to this for a minute. And then all of a sudden, a skull pops up on TV.","I knew my mom inside and out. I knew every little bit of her. So I paused the TV to look and see if those were her teeth. Because I knew what her teeth looked like. And, thank goodness it was not. But still, anything ever pops up, I'm always looking to see if those are my mother's teeth.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAmber and I are talking in October. It's almost Halloween. One of Donna's favorite holidays. She'd dress up like Dracula, hand out candy with the kids, decorate her living room with plastic skulls and cobwebs.","Amber used to do the same. But not this year. It's too much.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I can't really stand anything scary right now. I can't. One minute, I feel like I'm doing OK, my heart palpitations are going down, my anxiety is going down, and then boom, something happens. You know, whether it's something to do with this situation or something that I'm seeing, like, you know, a skeleton.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eBecause all Amber can think, when she sees those plastic Halloween skulls and skeletons: What if her mom is someone's Halloween decoration?","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I hate having all these questions in my head because it just, it haunts me every single day. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. The thing that, you know, like somebody even has my mom's head on a stinking mantle. As a decoration. Or has my mom's skin, like, he was taking skin and making these, like, these buttons and things out of it, or lampshades and all this sick stuff that you see.","That's my mom! Oh, God. She selflessly donated to them.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIn the letter Amber and all the other families got from Harvard, Medical School Dean George Daley said he was \"profoundly saddened\" to report the accusations against Cedric Lodge. It continued on to say that they were working with the feds and looking at their own internal paperwork to determine which donors may have been quote \"impacted.\"","What the next paragraph said grouped families into two categories.","One set got: \"We cannot rule out the potential that your loved ones remains may have been impacted.\" Essentially, they might’ve been stolen.","The other group: \"At this time, we do not believe that your loved one's remains were impacted.\" That's what Amber got.","The difference doesn't mean much to her, though. Her mom's body was there during the peak of Cedric Lodge's alleged thefts. How could Harvard be sure her mom's body was left undisturbed?","She joined one of a dozen lawsuits family members filed against Harvard. Hundreds of families signed on, all seeking the answer to the same question: How did this happen?","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e Ugh, it's just such, the amount of negligence that is here is astonishing. It's astonishing. This should have never, ever happened. This is the world's most reputable school. This is not some little community college somewhere.","\u003cstrong\u003eBailiff:\u003c/strong\u003e Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. All persons having anything to do before the Honorable Judge Salinger, Justice of the Superior Court, now sitting at Boston, within and for the county of Suffolk.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAfter the break, the families go to court for answers.","____","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eOn a Friday afternoon this past January, I sat with a handful of other reporters in the 10th floor courtroom at Suffolk Superior Courthouse in Boston. I watched as the courtroom filled with family members. The hearing was also being streamed on Zoom and I saw more and more faces pop up as it got closer to the hearing time. People signed on from work, from their bedrooms. I saw couples at the kitchen table together, staring into the screen, all waiting to hear what Harvard would have to say. By the time the hearing began, more than 150 people were logged on.","The judge seemed to be aware of all the eyes and ears on the proceedings.","\u003cstrong\u003eJudge Salinger:\u003c/strong\u003e We've got a lot of people in the courtroom. Let's make sure we use our big courtroom voices so that they'll get picked up on the microphone and our audience can hear you.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eWe were all there because Harvard didn't think it should be sued at all. Cedric Lodge, yes, the attorneys argued. But not the institution of Harvard, and not his two supervisors — Tracey Fay and Mark Cicchetti — who attorney Martin Murphy was there to defend.","\u003cstrong\u003eMartin Murphy:\u003c/strong\u003e The plaintiffs, uh, essentially allege that because, um, Mr. Lodge worked at Harvard, Harvard is responsible for his, uh, actions, uh, and we think that that's simply wrong under the, under the case law.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHarvard's attorneys argued they're immune from any lawsuits — thanks to the state's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. That law says that so long as an institution acts in what’s called \"good faith,\" they can't be sued.","\u003cstrong\u003eMartin Murphy:\u003c/strong\u003e We're entitled to dismissal because the backs of the complaint don't plausibly suggest either bad faith on the part of Harvard as an institution, Mr. Cicchetti or Ms. Fay, or suggest that Mr. Lodge was acting with the intent to benefit Harvard, or that this was part of his job to be selling individuals' parts on the open market. There's no allegation in the complaint that was part of his job.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eKathryn Barnett, the families’ lawyer, pressed for the answer to the big question on her clients' minds: What did Harvard know about what Lodge allegedly did?","\u003cstrong\u003eKathryn Barnett:\u003c/strong\u003e Harvard controlled their morgue. It was on their property, in their space. Lodge went in, carted out parts of the loved ones of our families, carrying them out. He let in nefarious characters over the course of years, willy-nilly, without any fear of detection, to pick and choose among the remains.","Harvard's response to our lawsuit wasn't to answer the lawsuit, but to file this motion to say we're immune, we acted in good faith, but Harvard doesn't want to allow any discovery. Harvard's position is just take our word for it.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eBarnett and the families' attorneys tried to get at those questions, but that wasn't what this hearing was about. I felt bad for the families watching as lawyers droned on in legal jargon.","\u003cstrong\u003eMartin Murphy:\u003c/strong\u003e If the court looks at section 14H of the 2012 Act...","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe case turned on arcane statutes.","\u003cstrong\u003eKathryn Barnett:\u003c/strong\u003e And again, under Rule 12, in deciding whether to dismiss...","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd legislative intent.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeff Catalano: \u003c/strong\u003eUnder the 12b6 standard that Harvard acted in bad faith...","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd whether a law designed originally to protect the organ donation process applied to the case of a rogue employee slicing up bodies after medical students were done with their work.","A few weeks later, the judge's decision dropped. Harvard — they won.","The judge ruled that Harvard is immune, that the school and Cedric's supervisors acted \"in good faith.\" He wrote that the families' lawyers don't have evidence that anyone at Harvard knew what Cedric Lodge was doing down in the morgue.","The judge said what Lodge did was as if a random stranger broke into the morgue and stole body parts.","The families’ attorneys have already filed an appeal. But that will likely take many more months.","The lawsuit dismissal doesn’t just mean Harvard won't have to pay up. It means there's no chance for what's called the discovery process against Harvard. That's where the families' lawyers can get information like Cedric Lodge's personnel file, logs of where the bodies were held and for how long, documents about security and procedures in the morgue.","\u003cstrong\u003eKathryn Barnett:\u003c/strong\u003e These are basic, basic things that presumably Harvard could just turn over, but they've refused to and now they're out of the case.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eI called up attorney Kathryn Barnett after the case was dismissed.","\u003cstrong\u003eKathryn Barnett:\u003c/strong\u003e It's appalling to the families I represent, to think that Harvard's position is this: We take no responsibility, we will give you no answers until, you know, go pound sand, we'll see you in court, and only until we are forced to do it, will we turn anything over.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe lawsuit also could have forced Harvard into DNA testing any recovered remains. Perhaps the buckets of body parts found in the Pennsylvania basement could belong to a Harvard family.","\u003cstrong\u003eKathryn Barnett:\u003c/strong\u003e If any part of one of those is a part of a loved one of a family I represent, of course I want to get it back for them, and they want it back.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's been almost a year now of nightmares for Amber. In one, she can't find her mom in the house.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e So I went on a search to find her and I found her in the woods without her head. And just everything just covered in blood. And it was, it was horrible.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eOr in another one, an old trash can washes up on the beach. It's filled with fruits and vegetables.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e And then I started digging through it. And then I found my mom's head on the bottom. And it's just, they just, they don't stop and it's, it's horrifying","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHer anger, and anguish, it's as fresh as it was that day she read the letter from Harvard. It hasn't faded. She knows it won't.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e I shouldn't have to be going through this. And I have to go through this for the rest of my life. The rest of my life. My mom passed away first from lung cancer and I knew what it was. And then to have all of this come about is just nonstop questions and I will never have answers. I'll never ever have answers.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eFamily members have told me that this is like a brand new grief, a new wound on top of the one that's barely healed. They can't tell others what happened; People don't know how to respond. They've even kept the news from their siblings, their children, sometimes. The unknowing is too painful. And they don't want to pass that pain onto others.","I think I understand this choice. Because the stories and anguish they've shared, they stick with me. Some of what they’ve told me, the torment they’re living with, I can’t shake.","Anne Flanagan told me about her mother, Billie.","After Billie died, Anne dressed her mother in her favorite clothes. She didn't want her to go to Harvard in her nightgown. Anne remembers the outfit: Billie wore a pretty striped shirt, a wool vest and a nice pair of slacks. Her socks matched the vest.","It was Anne who came up with the idea to donate to Harvard. She suggested it to her mom, who agreed. Now, she drowns in this guilt.","\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Flanagan:\u003c/strong\u003e I introduced the idea of body donation. So in a lot of ways, I feel like this is my fault, you know, that I, that we got into this mess.","It's just unbearable. I did this. I put her in that position.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eLara Szent-Gyorgyi can't stop picturing her mom, Gwen, in the morgue, as Cedric Lodge allegedly brought buyers in to shop for parts. Did collectors appraise her 87-year-old mother's naked and feeble body, deciding whether it was worth anything?","\u003cstrong\u003eLara Szent-Gyorgyi:\u003c/strong\u003e My mom was an old woman. She would be the first person to say, \"My decrepit body was just lying there.\" And she would be just horrified. And then that somebody was, for whatever motivation was buying part of her, like that would just be — like she'd be so angry.","I am angry that this happened to my mom. Like, all I can think of is how embarrassed and furious she would be.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eBoth of Paula Peltonovich's parents donated their bodies to Harvard. Her dad died in 2019; she lost her mom just a year ago, in March 2023.","When the news about the thefts broke three months later, it was too late for her dad. They had already buried his ashes. But her mom, Joan, was still in the morgue. Paula couldn't stand to leave her there, so she scrambled to get her mother back.","And she trusted Harvard so little, that she needed to see her mother's body for herself.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaula Peltonovich:\u003c/strong\u003e I wanted to make sure it was my mom. So I had to view my mom. To make sure it was her, and it was. Thank God.","We've all been sick about it. Imagine if that's your father or your mother.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are hundreds and hundreds more people like Paula and Lara and Anne and Amber, all carrying around this new, heavier grief. Grief they thought they had already dealt with. Grief that doesn't have an end date.","Amber finds herself talking to her mom's ashes less. That comfort she felt when the box returned from Harvard, that connection, it's not the same.","\u003cstrong\u003eAmber Haggstrom:\u003c/strong\u003e The bond that I originally had has been dwindling. And that's been very, very difficult because I once felt whole again and now I feel completely empty. Now, it's more tragic. Way more tragic. Because before, it's like, you go on with your new normal and you accept everything. And you at least try to accept as much as possible. And, but with this, I can't accept it.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe reason Amber and these other families are experiencing this new grief is because there's a market for their loved ones' bodies. Cedric Lodge wasn't allegedly stealing brains and skin for no reason. He was selling these parts. He was meeting a demand.","So, I set out to find some of the people who buy human remains. There’s a lot of them. They’re extremely online, and they’re not hiding.","I decided to start with the guy whose arrest unraveled this whole scheme. The guy keeping the body parts in five-gallon buckets in his Pennsylvania basement. A guy who, so far, hasn’t answered anyone’s questions: Jeremy Pauley.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Hi, how are you?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e Good.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003e I'm, I'm Ally.

I’m reporter Ally Jarmanning.","This is Episode 3: The collectors.","The story of why I'm on this doorstep in rural Pennsylvania starts nearly two years earlier.","In July 2022, police showed up at Jeremy's apartment — not the one I'm at now, but one he shared with his then-wife, about three hours away from here.","His wife had called the police there. Jeremy wasn't even living there at the time. She had gotten a restraining order against him and served him with divorce papers.","His wife went down into the basement and looked around where Jeremy kept his work. She found a few five-gallon buckets and inside: body parts. A lot of body parts. Brains, livers, skin and fat, a child's jawbone.","This was the break in the Harvard case. Except, when they found these buckets of body parts in his basement, officers had no idea they connected back to Harvard Medical School.","The details of the arrest were shocking, but not really national news.","What Jeremy would tell investigators and the connection to Harvard, we wouldn’t hear about for almost a year.","In this moment, police were just beginning to learn about Jeremy Pauley's pivotal role in this nationwide network of human remains trading — people buying and selling skin and bones and organs online and through the mail.","He is kind of a famous guy, at least in the online oddities circles. He's well known as a collector and dealer, and people respect him and his craft. He's big in body modification circles and does blood art which is, well, art with human blood.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley (on radio show):\u003c/strong\u003e I always tell people, like, I was the goth kid who never grew up.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I found a couple of interviews he did over the last few years.","This one, on YouTube, is from a radio show called \"Uncovering the Underground.\" Here are some parts of it.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley (on radio show):\u003c/strong\u003e There was an old show on Nickelodeon called \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" And, there was an episode, where one character, Dr. Vink, pulls out a jar with a human hand in it. And I, it's my first memory of just being like, \"Oh my god, that's so interesting.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Jeremy collected and sold bones and skulls, but his real interest was in what people in the oddities trade call \"wet\" specimens — preserved organs, tissues, skin, hearts and brains.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley (on radio show):\u003c/strong\u003e I always had a penchant for wet, especially fetal specimens. I love them because when I look at them, I don't see a dead baby.","I especially loved like anything with a congenital anomaly. Some people see them and they feel sad, but I'm like, do you know how many lives were saved? Because, you know, somebody saved this specimen and it taught doctor after doctor, after doctor, and now, you know, this particular deformity that was once a death sentence, now that kid can grow up and be a functioning adult.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e His explanation sounds almost noble, right?","These fetuses in jars served a higher purpose. They're marking the forward march of medicine.","But that's not all.","On the show, Jeremy talked about another interest of his: the craft of binding books in human skin.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley (on radio show):\u003c/strong\u003e I had seen a modern binding done and I was always fascinated, you know, by anthropodermic bibliopegy.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Jeremy told the host that he quote, \"got ahold\" of some human leather, and bound his first books. He was hooked. He searched for more skin, finding a jar of human tissue he says was left over from a doctor's collection.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley (on radio show):\u003c/strong\u003e Then I just kind of started hunting harder, calling up all kinds of places that I deal with, and, you know, if you see anything like this in storage, you know, call me. I have, like, big dry spells, obviously, because it's not, like, it's easy to come by. So, I do a lot of work trying to track it down.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e This, at least, is the story Jeremy gave publicly. But I know, from court records, that by January 2022, when this interview was released, Jeremy had a much steadier supplier.","Three months before this interview, Jeremy got a message online from a woman in Arkansas: \"I follow your page and work and LOVE it.”","She explained she worked at a mortuary, and they cremate donor bodies from a medical school there.","“Just out of curiosity, would you know anyone in the market for a fully intact embalmed brain?\"","Turns out, Jeremy was. They agreed on a deal of $1,200 for two brains with skull caps and a human heart.","That began a fruitful business relationship. The orders came quick. I'll read you some of the invoices she sent verbatim. They're all detailed in court records. And — warning — they're graphic.","\"Seven huge pieces of skin, two large pieces of skin with tiddy, four brains one with skull cap, one lung, one penis, two testicles, and 3 hearts\" — $2,000.","\"Half a brain, two smokers lungs, one lower chunk of pubic skin with peen and sack attached, two larger pieces of skin, one small piece with nip\" — $850.","The donor bodies would come in from the medical school for cremation, and the mortuary worker would message Jeremy to let him know the haul. Over a seven-month period, he paid her more than $10,000 for stolen donor bodies.","And then there were the fetuses.","In February 2022, a woman in Arkansas gave birth to a stillborn baby boy. She named him Lux. She wanted to have him cremated.","Lux ended up at the mortuary. As soon as he arrived, Jeremy's supplier jumped to message him. She sold Lux to Jeremy for $300. A deal because, as she said, \"he's not in great shape.\"","Jeremy later offloaded Lux to a guy in Minnesota in exchange for $1,550 and five human skulls.","Lux's mother got the ashes of someone. Or something. Not her baby.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eOh hey, puppy.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm thinking about all of this as I look up at Jeremy standing just inside his house.","I am doing something about the Harvard story and I know you probably cannot talk at all about what's going on, but I didn't know if you'd be willing to talk just a little bit about your work in the oddities trade, your interests in all this, like kind of how you got into this.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e If you want to reach out to my attorney, I have him vet everything and all that. I can give you his number.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that'd be great. Yeah.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHe pulls out his phone to get the number of his attorney. And while he does that, I'm able to look at him more closely.","There's a lot to take in, and I try to look without overtly staring. The entire right side of his face is tattooed. It looks like it's been colored in with blue marker, the design is so dense.","And his right eye, it's tattooed too.","There's no white around the iris, just a deep, deep black. A dark abyss in his eye socket. I keep trying to look him in the eyes, but I don't want him to think I'm staring.","His head is shaved, and short, dull metal spikes are embedded in his scalp. In some photos I've seen of him, he has a silver grille on his teeth with fangs, although I don't see that today.","Almost every news story about the thefts at Harvard includes his mug shot. Or photos from his social media pages, him grinning with those silver teeth looking exactly like the kind of guy you'd guess deals in human body parts.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eUm, yeah, I just — you know, you've kind of made the face of all this. And it just, you know, reading through the court documents, it's doesn't seem like you had any direct connection with Harvard?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, they like to, they like to use my face a lot. Yeah.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e And do you, why do you think that is?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean. I'm clickbait.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eHe gestures at his face to make the point. As if to say, \"duh, don't you see me?\"","There's some irony to his face being associated with every news story about Harvard. Jeremy didn't even have any direct contact with the Harvard morgue or its manager, Cedric Lodge. At least according to the court documents and police records I've reviewed. But he bought remains and traded skin with people who did buy remains sourced from Harvard and from Cedric Lodge.","He faced conspiracy and interstate transport of stolen goods charges, just like Cedric Lodge and the rest of the buyers. The Arkansas mortuary worker was charged, too.","At the point I'm talking to him, Jeremy has already pleaded guilty to the federal charges. He's awaiting sentencing. But that doesn't make him any more eager to talk to me. He keeps bringing up his lawyer.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eSome of the work I'm doing is talking to like a lot of people in the oddities field. So many people are asking, like, who are the people that are into this? I think most people are just grossed out by it right away.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I mean, it's a niche field in general, like, as a collector or a preservation artist or anything like that.","And it's about education, so like, I'm not opposed to doing an interview of that, you know, uh, realm.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e I mean, I'm just curious, like, how did you get into all of this?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e Like I said, I won't talk more until, you know, Jonathan clears things.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e OK. All right.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e But, like I said, I'm not opposed to it. I'm not shooting you down. I'm not against it. I think like bringing more attention to the not scary side of all this is important, you know so like, there's a chance.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e Have you said yes to anybody?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e No.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e No? How come?","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e The media's put a bad taste in my mouth for obvious reasons. You know, like, I'm just trying to get all this done, you know? So, like, I'm just, I'm not out there to try to get famous. I'm not out there to try to, like, talk to a thousand reporters. I'm not. I'm just trying to, like, keep on with my life right now.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e Totally. I appreciate it and sorry to burst into your house.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e It's OK.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eSo, I appreciate it.  Thank you. Nice to meet you.","\u003cstrong\u003eJeremy Pauley:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eThat was more than I thought I was going to get. He actually seems like a very nice guy. And less shocking-looking in person. Like, I think the tattooed eyeball was probably the hardest thing to look at.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAll in all, Jeremy was one of the nicer people I've ever door-knocked.","I reach out to his lawyer, who says he'll check with Jeremy, but I never hear back. Jeremy doesn't respond to messages I send him later directly, either.","Since I made that visit back in November, Jeremy pleaded guilty to more charges against him — state charges, abuse of a corpse. He was sentenced to two years probation for that.","So, Jeremy won't talk to me about his work in the oddities field or explain his interest in what he called the \"niche field\" of human remains. And I still have a lot of questions. How does someone get into collecting dead people? Where do they buy this stuff? And how do they think about the people these remains used to be?","After the break, I wander into a living room full of skeletons.","____","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I actually couldn't believe how easy it was to find human remains collectors to talk to. I logged onto Facebook and searched well, \"skulls.\" And I found a bunch of Facebook groups specializing in the oddities trade. I joined a public group called, \"Real Human Skulls Only. No Scammer.\"","Despite the name, there are a lot of scammers in this group. People post stolen photos and try to get some cash.","Some of these posts, it looks like they dug up a grave and snapped a photo of the bones to sell. The skulls are cracked and looked dirty.

It's tasteful. The skeletons are in glass display boxes, or hanging in coffins. They all have names. It's almost museum-like.","I'm not grossed out by it at all. I'm more intrigued. I'm interested in their interest in it all. I do wonder though, how different are Justin and Sonya than any other collectors?","They may use different words to describe what they do and not buy their skeletons off a website or Facebook, but they still own human remains. I keep wondering how Amber or the other Harvard victim families might feel about this.","It's complicated.","That said, it's been a nice evening among the skeletons. Justin grilled us some steaks, and Sonya made mashed potatoes and asparagus. Sonya's cleaning up the dishes while Justin gives me a more thorough tour of the living room.","He's showing me Edgar — a very tall skeleton they aren't quite sure the sex\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eof, when I look down by Edgar's feet and see a teeny skeleton on a wooden base.","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e That's Mini Me.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eIs that plastic, I assume?","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e (laughs)","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e No?

It can't be more than a foot tall, the bones so tiny they look like toothpicks. I can see the four pieces of its skull not yet fused together, what would be the baby's soft spot. It's so delicate. I'm a little stunned, and I don't know what to say.","I think about my own baby. He’s about to turn 1. And how when he was first born, I’d hold him and tuck his little head underneath my chin as he slept.

Like you can square that with your...","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e Uh, with with my maker?","Yeah, because there's a rescue. There are situations that the skeletons are in that if I have the opportunity to get them, I will.","But in order for me to get them out of there, it's going to cost money.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I look closer at Justin's fetal skeleton. I keep thinking of the baby in Arkansas, Lux, who was stolen and sold to Jeremy Pauley. I don't think Justin stole this, or knowingly bought something that was, but I can't help but wonder who this 36-week old baby was. Who were the mother and father?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eWhere do you think it came from?","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e I don't know, but whoever articulated it did a really good job, as you can see.","And you see how small the springs are on the jaw and all that? I mean, uh, someone with some serious skills did that.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e But it makes me, it just makes me wonder, like, was this a fetus that was supposed to go back to someone? Or was it just going to be...","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e I don't think so, because that came with a receipt.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I've been asking about the fetal skeleton for a few minutes now and I can sense a little tension. I let it be. Before I leave Justin and Sonya, I ask the bigger picture question that's been on my mind.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eDo you think, um, I mean, do you wonder, whoever these people were hundreds of years ago, how they would feel about being in someone's living room?","\u003cstrong\u003eJustin Capps:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I wonder about that. I wonder how many of them even had a choice to become medical specimens. And the only way I was able to get over any of it was to have a sit down conversation with each one of them that come in here and explain to every one of them, like, I'm not going to disrespect you. I'm going to treat you like you should be treated. As you can see, I do that. I'm not going to let anybody abuse you. I'm going to treat you like my family. You know, you're going to be living in my home. I might as well get used to you being here. We might as well get used to each other. So, don't haunt me.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I ask a version of this question to almost every collector I speak to, and I speak to a lot.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eDo you wonder at all about like, who these people were before?","\u003cstrong\u003eCollector 1:\u003c/strong\u003e I do\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eI definitely wonder who they are, who they were. Like I believe there's more than this, right, like this flesh and blood, um, so I look at it as a scaffolding of a life that has moved on.","\u003cstrong\u003eCollector 2:\u003c/strong\u003e Unfortunately, I'll never know that person's name who's in my cabinet. But they're kin to me.","\u003cstrong\u003eCollector 3:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I mean, it's, it took a whole life to live, for this skull to be there. So there's definitely some, some heaviness to it, you know. Which renders it more than just an object. They're not, they're not objects to just be played with and they're there to be respected.","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake: \u003c/strong\u003eIf somebody came to me and said, I know 100% that is my great grandmother, and I would like her back, I would give it to her.","Uh, but besides that, I don't ever really think about who that was, any more than I think about what happened to the turtle that was in that shell.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I visited Mike Drake at his Queens, New York apartment. It is a collector's dream in there — every wall and shelf is filled with knick knacks and oddities — glass eyes, masks, molds of teeth, turtle shells. There's a reason Time Out New York called him a curator of curiosities.","Mike was a collector from a young age, growing up in New Jersey. His gateway drug was a little gargoyle figurine his mom got him after he watched the \"Hunchback of Notre Dame.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e And, it went from there.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e By 16, he was fixated on owning a human skull. He was influenced, he thinks, by art. Portraits of learned men always had a skull on a shelf or in the subject's hands. You know, Hamlet: \"Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e From an artistic point of view, that was really in vogue for a certain period. If you were like a wealthy merchant or you wanted to show that you were an educated person, when they painted your portrait, you would have a skull in there somewhere, like, \"Hey look, I have a skull.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eIt was a mark of some kind of class.","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Ha.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e He still has that first purchase he made at an oddities shop in New York City.","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e So my first skull is right there on the top shelf. And I remember I saved up and I was so excited I went and I bought that. That's the only one I've kept. I've had others over the years, but that's my first and my favorite.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e It cost him a hundred bucks. It was and is basically legal for Mike to buy a skull or any other human remains. There’s no federal law against body parts buying. State laws are patchy and mostly unenforced. It's not legal to steal and sell human remains of course, but other than that, it's just like any other object for sale in a store.","In the '90s, Mike actually worked in the skeleton trade.","The internet was just becoming a thing, and there were lots of people who needed skeletons. And there weren't a lot of places to buy them.","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e This is going to be so hard for people now to conceive of, but if you wanted a life size skeleton for whatever purpose, for medical purpose, for a film, for a play, just for decoration, you either bought a real human skeleton from a medical supply company, or you bought a very expensive, which cost more than a human skeleton, a plastic reproduction.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eDid you ever think about when you were, you know, being the middleman of the skeleton trade, where they were coming from, like who the people were?","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake:\u003c/strong\u003e Not really, no.","I knew that, uh, a lot of them were coming from India and then from China, but as for who the actual people were, I did not really think about it, no.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eSome people might be surprised by that.","\u003cstrong\u003eMike Drake: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to sound uncaring or ghoulish, but I separate the person from the meat. And I don't think of myself as the meat. I'm really my brain, and my thoughts, and my spirit and maybe my soul. Once my body is turned off forever, this isn't me. This is just my container, my wrapper.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Mike’s pretty unsentimental about this. Which, I guess makes sense if you used to move skeletons around in your Chevy Cavalier.","But he got me thinking. About what a dead body is. Is it a person still? Or just an object. A container, no longer in use, as Mike put it. A wrapper that can be thrown away.","Our bodies, are they something to be saved and treasured? Or tossed?","At medical schools, most anatomy professors and students have an answer: the donated bodies should be treated with dignity. Cared for like they were actual patients. Kept together and buried or returned to their families.","But it hasn’t always been this way.","Next time, on \u003cem\u003ePostmortem\u003c/em\u003e, we go back to school – medical school."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":256163,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/tag/harvard-morgue-scandal","prefix":"WBUR's ongoing coverage:","title":"Harvard morgue case","index":1}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"full","itunesEpNum":"3","itunesSeason":"4","itunesTitle":"Postmortem, Ep. 3: The collectors","itunesSummary":"Who are the people buying this stuff anyway?

Through all these conversations, it becomes clear: There's no solid ethical line in this world of remains collectors; everyone is making up their own rules.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, comments or tips about this story, you could reach us at \u003ca href=\"mailto:LastSeen@wbur.org\"\u003eLastSeen@wbur.org\u003c/a\u003e.","itunesExplicit":false,"socialTease":"Who are the people buying this stuff anyway?","volume":3,"enableRecirculation":true,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"hideArchiveMsg":false,"disableAds":"enabled","audioDatetime":"1714554120","taxonomy":[{"id":64,"type":"category","name":"Crime \u0026 Justice","description":"","slug":"crime-justice","series":false,"global":false,"count":12462,"hide":false,"primary":true},{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"global":false,"count":59066,"hide":false,"primary":false}],"audio":[{"id":130744,"createdAt":"2024-04-30T16:01:45.000000Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-01T09:02:02.000000Z","fileName":"lastseen_0501_postmortem-market-body-collectors-oddities","playCount":0,"airDate":"2024-05-01","source":"lastseen","wordpressTitle":"Postmortem, Ep. 3: The collectors","wordpressSlug":"postmortem-market-body-collectors-oddities","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":2150,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Who are the people buying this stuff anyway?","megaphoneID":"f1c63394-070a-11ef-b73d-2bab62d678a8","megaphoneURL":"https://traffic.megaphone.fm/BUR2161492959.mp3","articleAPIURL":"https://api.wbur.org/stories?id=932438\u0026org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"https://api.wbur.org/audio/130744","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":34400489,"url":"https://traffic.megaphone.fm/BUR2161492959.mp3"}}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":932438,"type":"keyfigures","attributes":null,"body":"\u003ch2\u003eCredits:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReporter, host:\u003c/strong\u003e Ally Jarmanning\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEditors:\u003c/strong\u003e Dave Shaw and Beth Healy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional editing:\u003c/strong\u003e Katelyn Harrop and Frannie Monahan\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMix, sound design:\u003c/strong\u003e Paul Vaitkus and Emily Jankowski\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManaging Producer:\u003c/strong\u003e Samata Joshi\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExecutive Producer:\u003c/strong\u003e Ben Brock Johnson\u003c/p\u003e","placeholder":"\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"keyfigures\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"}},"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ep3Buyers-bw-scaled.jpg","width":3000,"height":2250,"title":"Skulls on display in Mike Drake's collection.

And in front of me, on a stainless steel table, is a dead body.","A woman — at least, that's what I'm told. I can't see her. The body is encased in an opaque white plastic bag. I call it a body bag, and I'm quickly corrected.","\u003cstrong\u003eJesse Gomes:\u003c/strong\u003e No, we don't call it, um, body bags. We call them donor bags, donor receptacles.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Jesse Gomes is the head of the anatomical gift program. He's the one who coordinates the body donations, from signing folks up, to hand-delivering the cremated remains to their families.","And he's quick to correct my language — at my request. Because for Jesse and his coworkers, the respect they give to the people who donated their bodies starts with the words that they use.","\u003cstrong\u003eJesse Gomes:\u003c/strong\u003e They are donors when they come here.","They've given us their donation, essentially. So they're not bodies, they're not human remains, they're not cadavers. They're donors. They're mentors.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I'm here with Jesse and Quinnipiac's director of anatomy, Dr. Maureen Helgren. It's her job to teach students not only about the bodily systems that make up a gross anatomy course, but how to treat the donors under their scalpel.","\u003cstrong\u003eMaureen Helgren:\u003c/strong\u003e  Oftentimes we refer to the donors as as silent mentors. Because they're teaching so much and not, you know, not verbalizing that, but they are teaching so much.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e As Dr. Helgren talks, she rests her gloved hand on the donor, like you'd put a hand on someone's shoulder as a gesture of connection, or reassurance. I ask her about it.","\u003cstrong\u003e Maureen Helgren: \u003c/strong\u003eTo me, it's a gratitude, right? I have a connection with this donor. I am thankful for this donor. This donor is helping me to do my job, right? I like to think that in our lab and in our programs, we can really teach some humanism through our anatomy experience.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Dr. Helgren's worked with thousands of donor bodies in her career. The donor in front of her, she's about to dissect and film to create an instructional video for the students.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e How do you think about the donors? Do you think of them as humans? Do you think about their humanity? Do you have to put that in a box to kind of do your job or how do you separate—?","\u003cstrong\u003eMaureen Helgren:\u003c/strong\u003e I don't have to separate because the humanity is always there. Does it mean that I don't get emotional? I do get emotional. Our world is a hard place right now. And then, when you think about how selfless someone has been for the benefit of somebody else that they don't know, that overwhelms me at times.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e And in all the hustle and bustle of the labs, they make time to recognize that.","\u003cstrong\u003eMaureen Helgren:\u003c/strong\u003e Like we put the donors on the table, and we kind of give a little thank you before the students come in. Right. And, you know, we might say a little prayer. We do what's in our heart as we prepare our donor for the class that's coming.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e This is the way people expect to be treated after death, right? With respect and dignity. This is the treatment those who donated their bodies to Harvard Medical School hoped for.","Instead, some of them got the Cedric Lodge treatment.","They were allegedly chopped up, packaged and sold to collectors. Horrifying. This shouldn't happen — especially not at an institution of higher learning.","Except, there's a history here. Our nation's medical schools have a dark past. Closer to Cedric Lodge's Harvard than we'd like to think.","I'm reporter Ally Jarmanning, and this is \u003cem\u003eLast Seen, Postmortem: The Stolen Bodies of Harvard\u003c/em\u003e.","Episode 4: The anatomy lab.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e That reverence for the dead that Dr. Helgren and the folks at Quinnipiac have, it's a relatively new thing.","Let’s visit the earliest days of medical schools. The late 1700s, Harvard Medical School is founded. Back then, what set medical doctors apart from other healers — who treated the sick with herbs or prayer — was the study of the human body. Anatomy. The act of dissecting a cadaver and understanding what went on inside. As one professor wrote, \"Anatomy is the charm.\"","Medical students were thirsty for this relatively new field of study.","\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Sappol:\u003c/strong\u003e You marked your ambition by saying, I'm going to really do serious anatomical study. And I have to dissect more than just the minimum.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eMichael Sappol calls himself a historian of anatomy and death. He wrote a book: A Traffic of Dead Bodies.","Those ambitious medical students, especially those looking to get some extra-curricular instruction in, they needed to get their bodies somewhere.","\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Sappol:\u003c/strong\u003e Sometimes they violated graves or lied to, or stole or paid agents to get stuff. There's this kind of like black market, gray market where you pay the keeper of the poor house or the jail to give you the bodies and they cart them off to the medical school.","In some cases, you might even finance your medical studies by stealing bodies for the other students and the professors.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Voluntary body donations like we see at medical schools now didn't exist in the 1800s. In fact, there was a stigma around ending up in an anatomy lab. Only the poor or marginalized were subject to the indignity of dissection.","The rich had mausoleums and sturdy caskets to protect their bodies. The poor were lucky to get a burial at all.","Perhaps the most famous — and most overtly criminal — shady medical cadaver suppliers in the world were William Burke and William Hare.","\u003cstrong\u003eBurke and Hare trailer:\u003c/strong\u003e Edinburgh, 1828. The greatest minds came from all over the world. And so did these guys.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Comedian Simon Pegg made a movie about the pair in 2010.","\u003cstrong\u003eBurke and Hare trailer:\u003c/strong\u003e We just have to work out what the demand is for and then supply it. Get rid of the body before it starts to stink up the place more than you two.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Burke and Hare would kill at least 16 people and sell the bodies to a local anatomist. Ten months into their scheme, they were arrested. Hare flipped on Burke, and Burke was hanged. And perhaps fittingly, Burke's corpse was dissected and his skeleton is on display at the Edinburgh Medical School's anatomical museum. A pocketbook was made from his skin.","Scandals like that would eventually lead to laws that would give medical schools a legal way of procuring bodies. Though, not exactly in a way that would be palatable today.","\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Sappol:\u003c/strong\u003e Medical schools start pressing legislatures for laws legalizing the provision of body through unclaimed bodies, mainly from poor houses and jails.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Harvard professors were among those who lobbied for what became known as the anatomy act. And it passed in 1831, making Massachusetts the first state to have such a law.","But in America, there was another source of bodies.","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e The domestic cadaver trade is a term that I came up with. Essentially, it is a trade in human cadavers that were being sold from plantation communities throughout the United States to medical schools for anatomical research, for dissection classes, for study of the human body.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly narration:\u003c/strong\u003e Daina Ramey Berry is a historian and a dean at the University of California in Santa Barbara.","She wrote a book called \u003cem\u003eThe Price for their Pound of Flesh\u003c/em\u003e. It's an unflinching look at how enslaved people were commodified and literally valued, from birth to death.","Dr. Berry thought the last chapter of her book would focus on enslaved people's burial practices. How they honored their dead. But then she discovered that even after death, Black people's bodies were not safe.","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Their bodies were used for medical education. Their bodies were the foundation for our early medical schools across the United States and some of the largest medical programs.","Some of the schools would brag about, we have great subjects for dissection.","It was all across the United States. I mean, I found bodies that were being traded as far south as Texas and as far north as Maine.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eShe dug into the archives of medical schools,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eincluding at Harvard. And there was one document in particular that chilled her — and made her realize she needed to keep going down this dark rabbit hole.","The letter, from 1845, was tucked away in the correspondence of a physician who later taught anatomy at Harvard.","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Somebody had written to him and was asking how much it costs to sell a dead stiff N-word and says ones that are not all cut up and that you can't nose or smell a mile off because I know that's the only trade that you participate in.","I mean that was, that was the big break for me, the breakthrough for me that I had to keep going.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Dr. Berry published a couple of pieces in \u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e exposing this dark trade in dead bodies. And the response she got floored her. She realized this wasn't just a slavery-era thing. This desecration of predominantly Black bodies, it continued for decades.","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e I received over 300 letters and emails and a lot of people that wrote me were medical doctors and they would say, \"I was trained in the ’50s, I was trained in the 1960s, and every single body that we used in our, at our institution was African American.\"","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e It's that not-so-distant history that may affect today's voluntary body donations. There are no official statistics, but anecdotally, most body donors are white. One study from the ’90s in Ohio found that 94% of the donor applicants were white.","Perhaps that's because white people don't carry the same historical skepticism, or legitimate fear, of the medical profession. And maybe that makes them more willing to donate their bodies.","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e There's been a larger history of African American or people of African descent having distrust with the medical profession because of things like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, because of the case of Henrietta Lacks.","Because of that, people are not as comfortable becoming donors, uh, and signing on for that.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Dr. Berry found racism was baked into the mindset of medical students and their anatomist professors. Black people were othered, and that gave white doctors some kind of perverse permission to steal or purchase those bodies.","And racism affected white doctors' reaction to what they found inside, what they wrote down in their notes that Dr. Berry read almost 200 years later\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e","\u003cstrong\u003eDaina Ramey Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e When they dissected a Black body, they were surprised to find that the insides looked the same. So there was a perception that the skin color meant that there was difference everywhere. Not just difference in the flesh, but difference on the inside. And I think that really brought that home for me.","I remember I had chills and I just sat with that record at the archive for a good while. Because it was in that moment that I realized, the amount of difference that people thought between the races was so profound that they thought that we weren't the same kind of human beings as one another.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eAfter the break, how are today’s doctors reckoning with this past. They’re still figuring it out.","____","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e The biggest shift for medical schools and anatomy came to pass within the lifetimes of some doctors still working today: voluntary body donation.","Passed less than 60 years ago, the federal Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, was designed to provide a legal and ethical source of human remains for organ transplant and medical research. It allowed people to designate their bodies for donation. Before that, it was actually illegal to donate your body in most places.","The stigma around body donation and dissection began to wane as some patients trusted the medical profession more. And medical schools began to court donors, as the well of unclaimed bodies dried up the government began paying for burial costs.","Body donation became a viable or even desirable end-of-life option for many people.","But a more modern view of sourcing bodies for medical schools didn't necessarily change how the cadavers were treated in the lab.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e 40 years ago, we were taught to think of those individuals as kind of pieces of wood, or, you know, inanimate objects that you were just learning anatomy from, and not to think too much about them.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eDr. Tom Champney is a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. And he's a big proponent of what he calls the \"ethical treatment of human tissues.\"","But that wasn't something he was ever taught. He remembers his early days of learning anatomy and the crass detachment most had.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e The attitude we were given is that this is something dead. You can work on it. You can do things to it. It doesn't really matter because the living thing that was in there is gone, right? So this is a piece of meat or, you know, an old piece of equipment or whatever, and you're just trying to learn from that.","Sadly, we never really considered who those individuals were, right? For whatever reason, it never occurred to us to think about them and what their lives were like, why they were there, etc.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e In his career, he's seen slow change in how professors, doctors and students treat bodies. Many programs have pushed more humane treatment of the donors — only uncovering the parts of the body the students are working on, for instance. Most programs, like Harvard, have annual memorial services to recognize the donors for their gift.","And those who disrespect bodies have faced repercussions. A University of Pittsburgh student was criminally charged two years ago after others saw him sticking his fingers inside a donor's genital region and smirking. He later got probation and community service.","Dr. Champney is one third of a group that calls themselves the \"Bioethics Unicorns.\" The other two are doctors Sabine Hildebrandt from Harvard, and John Cornwall from New Zealand. The cutesy name sprung from a presentation Dr. Cornwall put together, where he included some rainbow and unicorn clip art and said the group was mythical and unknown. The nickname stuck. They have business cards with it now.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's a kind of a nice way to talk about a topic that is not always as pleasant to talk about.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe three of them write and speak a lot about how the dead should be treated. And they've attracted more followers.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e There's been more of a resurgence in thinking about these individuals, and what their lives were, and how they have meaning, etc.","I and my colleagues have been trying to move that needle. To get more people to think of it that way, and to think of these as individuals in the lab and not as just objects to be worked on.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly narration:\u003c/strong\u003e Still, Dr. Champney says there are some professors today who, in the name of safety, direct students to store their scalpel blade in the body’s thigh — like a pincushion. Not exactly something you would do with a live patient.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e They look at the donor as a scalpel repository, but to me it's, it's an inappropriate, um, reflection of the donor's altruism and the donor's humanity.","\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e And Dr. Champney told me the law doesn’t really see human bodies as anything special.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e The egregious things like selling of body parts, or things of that nature, when those individuals are caught, they're usually tried for stealing property, right? They're not tried for doing something inhumane, or doing something unethical to that individual. They're charged because these individuals were considered property of the school or the university.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e Just look at Harvard's Cedric Lodge and the other alleged body parts buyers and sellers. They're charged with interstate transport of stolen goods. Not humans.","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e If he’d stolen a hundred computers from Harvard and transported them across state lines and sold those computers to other people, he would have been charged with virtually the same thing.","I think it in some ways stems to a legal belief, I don't necessarily know if this is an ethical belief, but a legal belief that once you die, you are no longer human and you're now property.","I would like to see that that expanded. That that there should be some middle ground where we treat deceased tissues differently than we teach that we treat old refrigerators.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eTo illustrate this point, Dr. Champney has a little poster he puts outside his office. He has a wonky name for it: the \"human tissue ethical continuum.\"","On the far right of the page is a picture of Dr. Champney. He represents the \"living human.\" To the left of him, is a living animal, a cute dog. Further to the left, a living insect. Then valuable art — the Mona Lisa. And finally, on the far left of the page is a pile of old appliances: washing machines and broken refrigerators.","He asks his students: where on this spectrum do you think donated human bodies should go? Should they be treated more like a living human — or precious art? Or broken down equipment?","\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Tom Champney:\u003c/strong\u003e I am on one's far end into the spectrum, where I think human tissues deserve a lot of respect and dignity. But there is, there is a wide range, even amongst the anatomy community, there's a wide range.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e There are few laws about how we should treat the dead. Really, there are no rules, either. Everyone is making up their own. Medical schools can create their own internal standards, but there's no regulation.","In Massachusetts, the state doesn't even bother to inspect medical school morgues. And once you own a body part you can do whatever you want. Skin can be turned into books by Jeremy Pauley. Skeletons can flank a Delaware living room. A skull can join your knick knacks on the shelf. It's all mostly legally okay.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Micah Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e There is no federal law that bans buying and selling of body parts as long as they're not going to go into another human being.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e FBI agent Paul Micah Johnson became the agency's go-to guy for human remains cases after he investigated a so-called body broker — it’s a company or individual that takes donated bodies, chops them up for parts, and sells the bones, tissues and tendons to others.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Micah Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e When I first started, I, I certainly imagined, you know, cadavers and a group of medical students standing around a cadaver and learning the parts of human anatomy. There is still that, but that's a very small part of it.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe body parts marketplace — it's big. This podcast has focused on two tiny slivers of the demand: medical schools for student learning — like Harvard — and the oddities marketplace — the guys like Jeremy Pauley. We'd need many, many more episodes to address all the other ways human bodies are bought and sold and used.","A handful of states — including Massachusetts — have laws against buying or selling human bodies. But this patchwork of laws aren’t very well enforced. There's no national database of human remains — even for bodies donated today.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Micah Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e There's much better tracing for a head of lettuce than there is for a human head.","We can trace a head of lettuce exactly to the particular farm from which it came and in all the steps in between. That's not required with human body parts.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e All those brains in jars and skulls on shelves, there is almost no way to know their origins.","\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Micah Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e If you stop for a minute and think about then where it came from, that's, that's the issue. We should be stopping to think. Did someone really want this on my shelf? Did they give consent for this?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eJarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003e Our understanding of what respect and consent looks like for the living in the medical world is relatively new. Remember those \"bioethics unicorns\" — those mythical anatomists teaching about respecting donor bodies? Well, the term bioethics — ethics in medicine — it didn't even exist until the 1970s.","Turning today's ethical and legal lens on the past can be deeply uncomfortable work. Controversial, even. Because a lot of this dark history, it's still around.","The people dissected or dug up, exist now as skeletons or organs in jars. They're now \"historic specimens\" — the stuff we see behind glass in museums. What are we supposed to do with all that?","Next time, on the final episode of \u003cem\u003ePostmortem\u003c/em\u003e, I visit an institution trying to reconcile its past and today's norms. And I look at how they're wrestling with our more refined understanding of how to treat the dead.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eFetal skeletons from two months gestation to newborn infants.

You have to visit the Mütter Museum.","I'd never heard of the Mütter so I looked it up. The museum is part of one of the oldest professional medical organizations in the country, and is housed in a big brick building in downtown Philadelphia.","The Mütter is advertised as a medical history and science museum. Online reviews call it a \"strange and beautiful place\" and \"fascinatingly bizarre\" but also, horrifying and exploitative.","I'm not sure what I was expecting. But the Mütter, it's unlike any museum I've been in before. It doesn't look like a museum at all.","More like a library, so I feel like I have to whisper.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e All right, walking in, you're just, the first thing you're struck by is this long wooden and glass cabinet filled with skulls.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e 139 skulls, to be exact. And that's just the start. There's the world's tallest skeleton on display, tumors in jars, a distended colon. All together, the Mütter has around 6,600 human remains in its collection — about a fifth of all its items.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eEar with ear basal cell. Skin growing tumor. Venereal warts. Tattooed skin. Vulva, in a glass jar.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e The museum is frank about what it is.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e Welcome to the Mütter Museum, the museum about you. We are a museum of medical history, but what is on display is also the tale of a universal human experience. Sickness and injury. For we are human, and we have bodies that, at some point in our lives, will fail us.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I read one more line, an inscription found in the oldest surviving dissection theater at a university in Italy, one of the world's original anatomy labs. The words were a promise to those medical students and a promise to the Mütter's visitors.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e This is the place where death delights to help the living.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Here at the Mütter, it feels like the right last stop among all the places we've been so far.","Harvard's campus, to figure out how the thefts of body parts from the morgue could have happened.","In New Hampshire with Amber, to hear about her mother and how the thefts triggered a new awful grief.","Among the skeletons in Justin and Sonya's living room, to understand why people want to own human remains.","And the anatomy lab of Quinnipiac's medical school, to look at the long, slowly shifting history of how medicine and the law treat the dead.","I'm reporter Ally Jarmanning and this is \u003cem\u003eLast Seen: Postmortem: the Stolen Bodies of Harvard.\u003c/em\u003e","Episode 5: A Reckoning","The Mütter is among the most famous public repositories of human remains. But it's also an institution struggling with the same questions I have. What universities and donor organizations, families and body parts buyers, ethicists and anatomists all have differing opinions on: how should we treat the dead? And who gets to decide?","The Mütter is small, just a few rooms inside a much larger building, but it's packed to the brim. It's full of medical specimens, tools and wax models.","It feels like walking into a 19th-century study. Wooden cases span the walls. Heavy drapes cover the windows. There's this haunting music that’s filtering in from an exhibit about the 1918 flu pandemic.","\u003cstrong\u003eMusic: \u003c/strong\u003eProtect yourself from infection / keep well and don’t get hysterical","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Some call the Mütter an oddities museum. But that's not the intention.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e The mission of the museum is the mission of the college, which is to advance the cause of health while upholding the ideals and heritage of medicine.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Kate Quinn is the executive director and is showing me around today. The museum is closed on this Tuesday, so we have the space to ourselves.","The Mütter is part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia — which is kind of a misnomer. It isn't really a college. It's a fellowship of doctors — one of the oldest medical organizations in the country, founded in 1787. And it played an important role for its fellows in its early centuries.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e Part of the perk of fellowship, is that you could come in and you have access to these collections to better your practice and to better understand when you're headed into surgery what a spleen looks like, how does the muscle form over the bone and things of that sort.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e The collection began with Dr. Thomas Mütter, a physician in what was then the emerging field of plastic surgery. He was collecting medical specimens along his journeys, and in 1858 he wrote the college to see if they wanted to take all his stuff.","The museum opened in 1911 and the collection started to grow. Doctors sent tumors and samples they collected from their patients — some obtained with patient permission, some not. A few people called up the museum and offered their soon-to-be transplanted heart, or an ovarian cyst set for removal, in a few cases, their whole bodies.","For decades, the museum did okay, a trickle of visitors every year.","Then, a new charismatic leader came in, and got herself a regular segment on late night television.","\u003cstrong\u003eDavid Letterman:\u003c/strong\u003e Uh, if you go to Philadelphia, ladies and gentlemen, they have there this museum. It's called the Mütter Museum, and it's, uh, just full to bursting with all manner of odd and obsolete medical items.","Here now is the director of that museum, Gretchen Worden. Oh, Gretchen!","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Gretchen Worden made appearances on David Letterman in the '80s and '90s, taking the train up from Philadelphia with suitcases filled with tools and medical oddities.","\u003cstrong\u003eGretchen Worden:\u003c/strong\u003e Calves can grow hairballs and humans can grow horns.","\u003cstrong\u003eDavid Letterman:\u003c/strong\u003e Oh no, really?","\u003cstrong\u003eGretchen Worden:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. This is from a 70-year-old woman. It took seven years to get this big and it was actually the second horn that she'd had, possibly in the same location. Probably removed from her head.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Before that episode went to commercial, Gretchen pretended to give Dave a lobotomy.","\u003cstrong\u003eDavid Letterman: \u003c/strong\u003eIt’s fun to pretend, isn’t it?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Between Gretchen's Letterman appearances, a renovation in 1986 and the internet's morbid fascination with the Mütter's collections, attendance exploded. Today, more than 130,000 people come through the Mütter's doors each year.","One of those visitors who found the Mütter was a 15-year-old Kate Quinn, growing up in Delaware County outside Philadelphia. Teenage Kate was awestruck by the wall of skulls, what's known as the Hyrtl Skull Collection.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e There's just something riveting about looking at these skulls and just seeing how different they are. Um, so there is, certainly it's a connection to humanity in ways that you can't get.","This is remarkable to be able to compare these, these skulls. And there's a fascination with that.","But, there's also the flip side that when I'm here, and I know that these folks were stolen, people committed suicide, they were in mental institutions.","There's a harder aspect of feeling comfortable viewing them in that way.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Adult Kate Quinn, museum director Kate Quinn, sees these skulls a little bit differently. She looks through the descriptions on placards underneath each skull. There is the most basic of information: a few have names, how they died, their ages. She looks at one skull in particular and reads the description underneath.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e What happened with this woman who is a child murderer, who was executed in Ukraine? What was her story? What was happening there? Did she murder her own child? Was she really a child murderer? I mean, going back, you can't help but think of the humanity of this person.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e It's these questions that have led the Mütter to take some existential steps. For the first time in 80 years, they're undertaking an audit to understand what objects and remains they have and where they may have come from.","And they're asking themselves how and why some of the human specimens are on display. Not just can we display this, but should we? What is ethical? What does consent look like?","At the Mütter, some of the remains on display… there was no consent.  Some were flat-out stolen. There are portions of Albert Einstein's brain in a glass case, despite his desire to be cremated and never be put on display. There is the \"soap lady,\" a woman whose body was mummified in her own fat and basically stolen from a graveyard. There’s the American Giant, a seven-foot six-inch skeleton who was gifted to the museum with the caveat that they never ask who he was.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e What should happen with those remains, I think we need to have provenience and provenance collected about every individual. We have an obligation to know who belonged to this skull? Who belonged to this skeleton? What did they want?","If this was your grandmother, and you knew your grandmother was a devout Catholic who needed to be buried, is it okay that we have that information and they're on display here?","That feels incorrect. But if there's informed consent, and folks know that they're giving these collections of themselves, literally, to individuals or to museums, then that, there's more power in that, for sure.","Our questions moving forward: Is this research? Is this science? What does it mean to be on display? Is that something they would have agreed to?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Mütter isn't the only institution asking these questions. The American Museum of Natural History in New York pulled all its human remains from public display and is working to repatriate what it can.","The Smithsonian Institution recently returned an Alaska woman’s brain to her family — 90 years after it was taken for a so-called “racial brain collection.” The institution has apologized for how it collected human remains, calling it the Smithsonian’s “darkest history.”","Harvard is addressing these issues too. It has a whole anatomical museum that’s now closed to the public. And remember how remains collector Jeremy Pauley was binding books in human skin? Well, Harvard had its own flesh-bound book in its collection. The 19th-century volume was owned by a doctor who took the skin — without consent — from the unclaimed body of a female patient in a French hospital.","Until recently, anyone could view the book. Some students were pushed to check it out as part of a hazing ritual.","But just this spring, Harvard announced it removed the human binding and is working to find a final respectful resting place for the remains.","For a museum like the Mütter, though, it's not as simple as just removing a few exhibits. Because their whole thing is human remains. Fans of the museum are worried that the end result will be a sanitized Mütter that is unrecognizable.","Some have said the administration is being too \"woke\" and that \"cancel culture\" is coming for the Mütter.","The museum has held open houses and feedback sessions. Like this one, from October.","\u003cstrong\u003eMeeting facilitator:\u003c/strong\u003e Good evening, everyone. Welcome to tonight's forum. We're so glad that you're here.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Folks brought their frustrations, their fears and their personal experiences with the Mütter.","\u003cstrong\u003eMeeting participant 1:\u003c/strong\u003e Trying to retroactively apply standards from today to the past is incongruous. It's like asking somebody who built a house 400 years ago for their mortgage paperwork.","\u003cstrong\u003eMeeting participant 2:\u003c/strong\u003e Death is not a comfortable topic, especially in a culture that avoids looking at it that hides it away.","We have a museum here that allows people to come and sit in their discomfort and have emotional responses to that discomfort and then learn through it and process that discomfort.","\u003cstrong\u003eMeeting participant 3:\u003c/strong\u003e I was born with a rare congenital deformity called Ectrodactyly, otherwise known as Lobster Claw Syndrome. The Mütter Museum's exhibit on congenital deformities is the only place in the city of Philadelphia where I can see people like myself represented.","For some of us, places like the Mütter and all of its complicated, sometimes macabre glory are the only place we can go to feel human. Places like this hold our histories. We deserve to be able to see ourselves reflected somewhere in this world, even if it's under glass.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e It's this complexity that made me want to visit the Mütter. Not so I could ogle some dead bodies, but to find out how Kate Quinn and her staff are working through these questions.","Kate says the Mütter will always be a place for people to see the breadth of the human condition, what makes up each of us inside.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e We will find through our research where it seems to be acceptable for us to have remains on display.","I can't imagine a Mütter that doesn't. But we need to make sure that we have them ethically and that we've got some measure of all of the research that we can about these individuals to say that we feel with confidence this person would have been all right being here.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Still, she thinks they'll be lucky to identify half of the human remains the museum holds.","After the break, Kate and I go deeper into the museum, and I come face to face with an exhibit that forces me to ask some hard questions.","____","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Kate Quinn and I walk downstairs to the bottom floor of the museum, where some of the most famous residents are displayed. The death cast and shared liver of Cheng and Eng, the conjoined twins from Siam, now Thailand, who made a living traveling the world and giving lectures. The eight foot long \"mega colon\" that held 40 pounds of human waste when the individual died. There are the skeletons of Harry Eastlack and Carol Orzel, two Philadelphians who suffered from a genetic disorder that fused their joints and created painful posture. Both Harry and Carol voluntarily gave their bodies to the Mütter. Carol with the request that the museum show off a portion of her collection of costume jewelry alongside her bones.","And then there’s this: fifty-plus fetuses and newborns in jars. Two hundred more are in storage. The disorders on display range from spina bifida to hydrocephalus. There are fetuses that couldn't survive outside the womb, because their brains were growing outside their skulls or were missing altogether.","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e Folks did refer to this place as the, as the dead baby museum and you can see why. I mean, you come through and these, these specimens, these displays, um, they stick with you for sure.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I'm looking at these fetuses — and the fetal skeletons next to them — and I'm thinking of my time among the skeletons just the night prior, at Justin and Sonya's house in Delaware. And my surprise — and shock — that they owned a 36-week-old fetal skeleton, what Justin called Mini Me.","Here I am looking at a whole wall of fetuses and skeletons. And I realize, just because this is a museum doesn't mean I shouldn't be asking the same questions that I did of Justin.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think I told you about the 36-week-old fetal skeleton that the guy was talking to you last night had. I was thinking like, \"Where did this baby come from?\"","Does whoever gave birth to this child, this stillborn child. Do they know what happened? Do they know where it is?","\u003cstrong\u003eKate Quinn:\u003c/strong\u003e I have those questions, too and again, we do have some of the records and some did give consent for the specimen to be taken after, as they left the hospital. The consent forms, you know, are for research or to science.","And so, you know, does that mean display? This is one of the collections where I think that question comes up pretty strongly. Also, I'm not a mother, but I can imagine that this would be one of the most difficult times in your life, if your baby died, um, if your fetus didn't survive, could they make a decision in that time frame that was really informed?","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I wonder about the doctors who kept these specimens, did they stop to ask that question.","Kate leaves me to look around the museum alone. Even though nobody alive is around, I feel like I need to whisper.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e It's odd being here alone. I'm glad I am, because I really get to take everything in. But it's also kind of unsettling to, to kind of just be with myself.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e I have time to look around, spend some time with the displays, and think.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e It's kind of overwhelming the longer you're in here. Especially reading everything, and not just looking at it.","Fetal skeletons from two months gestation to newborn infant. This collection illustrates the development of the fetal skeleton. Infants are born with about 300 individual bones.","Kidneys, bladders, kidneys, prostates, another kidney, another kidney, some with kidney stones, kidney with high blood pressure, a bladder that was shot during World War I.","This one doesn't have a sign. It's someone's bottom half,  I can see a penis and testicles. Veins. Muscles. Legs look like they've been barbecued.","All right, I think I'm ready to go.","Wow.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Out of the dark of the museum and back in the bright light on the sidewalk outside, I thought about this broader story, about how the Mütter fits into the bigger world that I've immersed myself in. And it raises some uncomfortable questions.","What role does a place like the Mütter play among collectors? Do people visit here, then go home and log onto Facebook to find their own piece of history? Is the Mütter, unwittingly, normalizing the practice of collecting human remains?","Some of the collectors I spoke to talked about this desire to open museums of their own. Because, why should highbrow institutions be the only places that get to keep these items?","Jeremy Pauley is one of them. Remember him? The guy with buckets of body parts in the basement, whose arrest sparked the whole Harvard investigation? Jeremy ran a traveling exhibit of his collections called the Memento Mori Museum — that's a Latin phrase meaning \"remember you must die.\"","He wanted a brick-and-mortar museum someday, to show off his medical specimens, his skulls, those fetuses he loved that showed the march of human medicine.","Many people are deeply disturbed with someone like Jeremy having his own little collection of fetuses and skulls. Yet visitors pay 20 bucks apiece to look at many of the same sorts of items at the Mütter.","Is it okay if it’s in a museum? Or is none of it okay?","I think about the supply, the source for these items. There are only so many historical medical specimens out there, collected decades or centuries ago under murky but somewhat more acceptable circumstances to our modern minds.","Doctors who convinced bereft mothers to sign away their stillborn babies. Grave robbers who dug up fresh bodies for dissections.","How far away is Cedric Lodge from them? Could a place like this — its existence and society's acceptance of it — give him some moral permission when he decided — allegedly — to start stealing body parts from donors at Harvard?","So far, he hasn't said.","I tried to reach him. I visited his tidy split-level home in Goffstown, New Hampshire.","As I walked up to the door, I could see someone who looked like Cedric through the window.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eOh, someone's home. I can see somebody in the dining room.","He's here, but he's not gonna answer.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e When I turned around to leave, someone had closed the shades.","We still don't know how Cedric got the idea to allegedly do what he did. And I have to still say allegedly because, as of this writing, he's pleaded not guilty to federal charges of conspiracy and interstate transport of stolen goods.","He's scheduled to go to trial in August.","But as the months tick on, more people in the scheme have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. I told you about basement body parts guy Jeremy Pauley — he got two years probation for state charges of abuse of a corpse. He's still awaiting sentencing on the federal charges. The Arkansas mortuary worker who sold Pauley so many stolen remains — including Lux, the stillborn fetus — she pled out.","And even Cedric's wife, Denise Lodge, has changed her plea to guilty — for interstate transport of stolen goods. She faces up to 10 years in prison when she's sentenced.","I got Denise's attorney, Hope Lefeber, on the phone and asked the obvious question: Why did Denise do this?","\u003cstrong\u003eHope Lefeber:\u003c/strong\u003e Um, just, you know, her husband, her husband was doing this and she just, you know, kind of went along with it.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape): \u003c/strong\u003eMm, okay. It wasn't her idea?","\u003cstrong\u003eHope Lefeber:\u003c/strong\u003e No, no, no.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning (on tape):\u003c/strong\u003e Do you know why he decided to start doing this?","\u003cstrong\u003eHope Lefeber:\u003c/strong\u003e No, I don't. Um. There may have been financial prob — I think there were financial problems, health problems.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e Maybe Cedric just saw those body parts as a commodity, objects to make money off of.","Or maybe there was some kind of darker fascination with this world. He did drive his Subaru around with that Grim Reaper license plate, after all.","Which brings us back to Harvard Medical School, the place that employed Cedric Lodge for almost three decades, the institution donors and their families trusted. What happened with them?","Well ... nothing.","The donor families' lawsuit against Harvard is stalled after the judge dismissed it. The families have appealed and hope they can get Harvard officials to sit for depositions and hand over records that might explain what went wrong in the morgue and who should be held accountable to try to ensure this never happens again.","After the news broke last June, Harvard named an outside panel to review the anatomical gift program. And even though this was Harvard's handpicked group they still found faults with how the program was run: Lax security. Cracked floors and damage to a walk-in freezer used to store bodies. Worn out student labs built three decades ago. No protocol for tracking body parts that are held long-term. And an onerous, manual tracking system for all the donor bodies.","It’s hard to know for sure if Harvard has made any of the changes the panel called for, and if the program is more secure now. They wouldn't let me visit the labs. And Harvard's administration has refused my requests for interviews.","They did provide a written statement in response to my many questions. They say a task force is working through the outside panel’s recommendations and that they’ve made “significant security upgrades,” though they didn’t replace their security contractor.","Here’s more of their statement: “The alleged criminal actions by former employee Cedric Lodge were shocking and abhorrent..” It continues: “We reaffirm our deep sorrow for the uncertainty and distress that families face as the criminal proceedings continue.”","Still … it’s clear Harvard wants to move on from this chapter.","As far as I can tell, nobody — other than Cedric — lost their jobs. When I asked if anyone else was disciplined or fired or even investigated, Harvard’s responses focused only on what was in the indictment and who was criminally charged. They wouldn’t say whether anyone else was held accountable for failing to supervise Cedric.","Both of Cedric's bosses are still still appear to be working there. I actually saw one of them, Tracey Fay, pop up on a zoom in as an attendee in a webinar a few months ago. The session’s title? “The Way Forward: Operating an Ethical Body Donor Program in the 21st Century.”","\u003cstrong\u003eHarvard voicemail:\u003c/strong\u003e You have reached the anatomical gift program at Harvard Medical School.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e After a five-month pause last year, Harvard’s taking donor bodies again.","\u003cstrong\u003eHarvard voicemail:\u003c/strong\u003e If you are calling to report the death of a registered donor during business hours, please leave a message with your name and telephone number, and we will return your call as soon as possible.","\u003cstrong\u003eAlly Jarmanning:\u003c/strong\u003e They had been turning away registered donors and referring them to Tufts Medical School, but no longer.","And it looks like they’re filling Cedric’s old job. In February, Harvard advertised a position that sounds a lot like Cedric’s. The title isn’t “morgue manager,” it’s \"research assistant III.\" The job reports to the managing director of the anatomical gift program And — get this — the person will work under quote “minimal direction.”","The duties are what I'd expect: assisting with embalming the donor bodies, preparing them for cremation, keeping the morgue clean and neat.","The last item on the list of responsibilities for the position stood out. \"Upholds highest standards of care to ensure the utmost respect of all human body donors.\""],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"id":256165,"url":"https://www.wbur.org/tag/harvard-morgue-scandal","prefix":"WBUR's ongoing coverage:","title":"Harvard morgue case","index":1}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"full","itunesEpNum":"5","itunesSeason":"4","itunesTitle":"Postmortem, Ep. 5: A reckoning","itunesSummary":"In Episode 5 of \u003cem\u003ePostmortem: The Stolen Bodies of Harvard\u003c/em\u003e, reporter Ally Jarmanning digs deeper into the \"legitimate\" realm of body-parts collecting ⁠— museums ⁠— and asks the burning question: How different is this from the world of Jeremy Pauley in his basement or Cedric Lodge seizing a financial opportunity at Harvard's morgue.\r\n\r\nAt the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, she takes us through displays of skeletons and sometimes-troubling human specimens.

And the other... on the run.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eGeorge Correia: Sister fighting against brother, trying to lie, to set up your own brother, what kind of feelings you have, lady?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd despite the fact that this event happened more than 20 years ago, it's never been resolved.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Oh wow.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n… a murder.\r\n\r\nI’m Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair.\r\n\r\nChapter one: Boxes\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the younger brother receiving voicemail threats from his family. Shane Correia. He’s the reason \u003cem\u003eI’m\u003c/em\u003e here…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Hi, Shane. I'm Amory. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: So nice to meet you Amory. Welcome. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI first met Shane back in 2017. I’d gone to his New York City apartment to interview him for \u003cem\u003eanother\u003c/em\u003e podcast I make called Endless Thread. It was for an episode about his experience with homelessness. Shane spent a period of time in his teens sleeping on the subway. No where else to go.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I was angry and pissed and sad. I only had until morning when, when school started for like some normalcy.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBack then, I didn’t know much about the murder that affected Shane’s life.  But the way I see it now, Shane doesn’t end up sleeping on the subway WITHOUT \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e dark chapter.\r\n\r\nShane was born in the Bronx. The youngest of four siblings — three boys and a girl with parents who were never \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e fighting. Name-calling, violence, an ugly divorce… it was a BAD scene. So by his preteen years, Shane and his mom and sister had moved across the country to Washington state. They were all devout Jehovah’s Witnesses.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: First Corinthians 1533. Do not be misled. Bad association spoils useful habits. Still know my verse. Couldn't shake that part. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e a Jehovah’s Witness anymore. In large part because of something he was realizing about \u003cem\u003ehimself\u003c/em\u003e around this time.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I remember the night that I, I came out to my mom. She was in her room, and I like roll in the chair from my room and like put it in the doorway and I’m like, so mom, I, I have something that I want to tell you, and I'm like trying to couch it as much as possible. And I tell her I'm attracted to men. And she looked at me and she, she said, why is it my children become my worst fears?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane’s mom mostly stopped talking to him. She’d leave food outside his bedroom door, as if he were in solitary or something. And then, right around this same time… came THIS…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Arrests Made in Woman’s Killing. Daughter-in-law Accused in Woman’s Killing.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe “daughter-in-law” accused… is Shane’s sister.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Woman Pleads Not Guilty to Murdering Her Mother-in-Law. Slaying Suspect Has Bail Tripled. Woman’s Murder Charge Upgraded.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis murder was a big deal in a small, Washington town. And word started spreading, from newspaper headlines to gossiping teenagers at Shane’s school.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I remember like going into the lunchroom and like this group of kids is like coming toward me. And like the kid that I don't like is like, so is it true that your sister killed someone?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eHonestly, after that I just kind of stopped going to school. I had always been a really good student up to that point, and then I just kind of shut down.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nGoing to school felt impossible, being at home with a mom who would barely talk to him felt impossible. So Shane flew back across the country by HIMSELF to the only other place he knew… New York\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: So I slept on the train. Um,  Went to school, went to work, still gotta earn that paycheck hourly.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane finished high school like this — unhoused. He worked part-time jobs to get by.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: And like going to work, um, in a rumpled suit because you have no place to put it. Like that was when I actually started to feel homeless.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane eventually pieced together enough of an income to rent a room in an apartment. He put himself through college. Then law school. By the time I spoke to Shane for Endless Thread, he was working in the Bronx District Attorney’s office.\r\n\r\nThe criminal justice system, to Shane, is something that’s brought ORDER to a chaotic life. It’s dealt with things in a way HE hasn’t been able to\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\nIncluding his sister being accused of murdering her mother-in-law. Even when asked point-blank back in 2017: do you think she did it?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Uh… I don’t know. Everyone's got a different story and, and this is where I just kind of surrender to the justice system.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s where we’d left things back then, as far as the murder was concerned. But the experience of hearing his larger story told by an outsider was pretty cathartic, Shane told me. He wrote to me after that episode came out, saying, “I feel a bit more unleashed from some stuff I didn't fully know was holding me back.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was it. I THOUGHT. Time passed. Shane changed legal jobs. Adopted a dog.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Tango, up! Good boy.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd then, about three years later, in the spring of 2021, I got an email from Shane out-of-the-blue. There was someone \u003cem\u003eelse\u003c/em\u003e looking to be “unleashed” from something holding HER back.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Look, I don't really know her story.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSOMETHING that’s been boxed up, and — for Shane, at least — untouched for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: So I think that my sister is capable of committing such a brutal crime?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane was reaching out to say that that question might finally get answered. Because the person who could settle it for him, once and for all? She wanted to talk.\r\n\r\nAnd she wanted to talk… to me.\r\n\r\nComing up, Shane’s sister.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Check, check. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt’s a couple weeks after Shane emailed me saying his sister wanted to, quote, “speak openly about something that has caused a lot of pain in our collective lives.”\r\n\r\nThe murder of her mother-in-law. I’d seen pictures of Shane’s sister in newspaper clippings from the early 2000s. Handcuffed, wearing the stereotypical bright orange jail get-up. No make-up. Her expression ranging from self-assured to resigned. I didn’t know what to expect 20 years later. And the last I’d heard about it from Shane…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Uhhhhhh…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n…didn’t put me at ease. And yet…when she appeared on my screen… I felt surprisingly calm.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Hi. Good morning. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: How are you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I'm okay. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Sophia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: A little nervous. I won't lie.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Yeah. Well, we’re embarking on something new.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI say that as if I knew WHAT we were embarking on. But listening back to this, I wanna warn my past self: 'Girl, you have NO idea what’s coming.' Sophia didn't either.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: well, let's just see where it goes. Why not? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia showed up to our first video call looking nothing like the woman I’d seen in the newspapers — her long, jet-black hair shiny and neat, her face impeccably made up: winged eyeliner, red lipstick, meticulously shaped eyebrows, and an almost airbrushed appearance that defied everything I knew about her life at that point.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I wake up, I have usually several cups of coffee and I’m watching the news\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShe sounded so… normal. Sweet, even.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I do a little bit of gardening, I listen to music.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShe was talking to me from \u003cstrong\u003e[BLEEP]\u003c/strong\u003e. Yeahhhhh, I can’t say where she is. I can’t say why I can’t say either. Yet.\r\n\r\nI can say… that, contrary to her appearance, Sophia feels anything but put-together inside.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: The only thing I can do, because I'm at my bottom, is stand up for myself because I have zero expectations that anyone else can do it for me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShe feels held back from the life she had imagined for herself. A life that was really just starting 22  years ago… with a new husband of 4 months… new in-laws with whom she’d quickly become close.\r\n\r\nThen came January 10th, 2002. Sophia’s mother-in-law, Marlyne, was supposed to come over to her house for lunch that day. She didn’t show… and when Sophia and her husband went over to Marlyne’s house to check on her, they found her… lying on the basement floor.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDispatcher: 911, how can I help you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Hi, I have an emergency.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne Johnson had been bludgeoned to death.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDispatcher: Do you know what happened to your mom? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: She was murdered. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDispatcher: Okay. Who murdered your mom? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I have no idea. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDispatcher: What makes you think she was murdered? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: The hammer imprint on her forehead where there was teeth and eyeballs.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Is there something that you typically do on this day?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: This is a day I wish never existed.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt’s now January 10th, 20\u003cem\u003e22\u003c/em\u003e — twenty years to the DAY that Sophia’s mother-in-law was murdered. Sophia is in her mid-40s at this point, but every year, on this day… she says she's transported back.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I'm 23 years old in my head and this is 2002. And you know what I thought? I thought it's January 10th, and whoever did this to her, do they know that it's January 10th? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDo they know? They’re out there. Somewhere. Then again, there are a lot of people who would say… that the person who killed Marlyne… is talking to me right now.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I wanna say, and be very honest with you, that if I did Marlyne's murder, they wouldn't have to worry about finding me. I would turn myself in.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia has always held fast that she DID NOT kill her mother-in-law. But she also says… there’s a LOT to this story that she’s never told ANYONE until now. This is how she \u003cem\u003ethinks \u003c/em\u003eabout her life.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: It is a house that has lots of boxes. And lots of different rooms that need to be unpacked and not necessarily sure where to start.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Okay. It's Monday, April 26, 2021, and I got a box today. [00:00:14]\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe day I started unpacking metaphorical boxes with Sophia, a physical one showed up at my office.\r\n\r\nInside this box… were VHS tapes.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Sophia says that she's never watched them. She told me today that she does not want to watch them and. // she said that she's worried that, like, it'll put someone else's version of the story back in her head. And right now she just wants to focus on what she knows to be true about what happened\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e      \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n13 tapes in black and gold cardboard cases.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Oh, this is a lot. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt was like a time capsule, this box. Those white stickers along the long edges, handwriting labeling each one in blue and black pen.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Alright, let’s see. So these tapes on the side, oh my god, it says State v. Johnson, Sophia. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge Woolard: We're ready for the jury?  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Yes, your honor. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese LaVallee: Yes, your honor. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge Woolard: Thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThese tapes are the video footage of Sophia’s murder trial. And they were really just the beginning. I didn’t know what was in all of Sophia’s boxes. I know now… there’s abuse. Disownment. Financial crimes. Deportation. To start.\r\n\r\nThe boxes of my OWN life… look nothing like Sophia’s. And yet, the more of HERS I’ve opened, the more I’ve realized that they hold a lot of my greatest fears: being betrayed by someone who’s supposed to be on my side; never being truly believed; loving something more than anything in the world, only to have it taken away.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: My son turned 19 years old yesterday, never met him. Don't know anything really about him. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHer SON. \u003cem\u003eWhen\u003c/em\u003e Sophia was accused of bludgeoning her mother-in-law to death, she was SIX MONTHS PREGNANT. She gave birth to her only child while incarcerated, and hasn’t seen him since.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I do not want another one of his birthdays to go by without at least having an image of me and hearing the truth about what I'm sure he's read and heard about his entire life.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s when I realized… that Sophia is really trying to clear her name in the eyes of ONE person.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: The only thing he will ever know is that I was accused, his grandmother is dead. This is my legacy. This is forever my legacy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut maybe… it doesn’t have to be. Sophia can’t start over, but she might still have time to CHANGE that legacy. Pretty early into reporting this story, someone told me that Sophia's life just seems so... FUBAR. I wasn't familiar with this term, but it's a military acronym. 'Fucked up beyond all repair.' BEYOND ALL REPAIR. That idea has stayed with me. Not as a statement... but a QUESTION. Is Sophia’s life beyond all repair? And if she is, in fact, innocent of murder, will telling her story help change some people’s minds about her?  Starting, perhaps, with Shane…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Do I believe what she's saying, that she believes she's innocent. Like I can believe that. But belief is very different from fact, you know, like someone still died. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: if he believes, if anybody believes that I am that person, then I just don't know what that says. That means that I'm not explaining it right or he doesn't know enough. And I never want my son to ever think that: “Mom, I love you anyway.” That is not the right answer. That's not the right answer.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe right answer, to ME… is just the truth. I’ve been up-front with Sophia about this from the very beginning.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I can't root for people in this story, but I can root for the truth. And if the people are aligned with the truth, then I'm rooting for the people, you know? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I agree with that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt’s been almost 3 years since my first conversation with Sophia. I’ve spoken to dozens of people connected to this story. I have thousands of pages of case files and court records. I have in-for-ma-tion. And now…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: What the f***? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003eShane\u003c/em\u003e does, too.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Oh, this hurts. This hurts. I can't read it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n20 years after this murder uprooted his life, Shane’s decided he’s not going to surrender to the justice system anymore. Because, according to the justice system, this murder is technically a cold case.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: This is not right. I don't care who it is. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNext time, Shane digs into his sister’s case file.\r\n\r\nAnd \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e dig into Sophia’s trial… and the key witness who testified against her.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: the person kinda took...it was like a stocking off their face. And it turned out to be… my sister. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia’s OTHER brother.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I’m gonna fight you guys. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBeyond All Repair is a production of WBUR, Boston’s NPR, and ZSP Media.\r\n\r\nIt’s written and reported by me, Amory Sivertson, and produced by Sofie Kodner.\r\n\r\nMix, sound design and original scoring by Paul Vaitkus, production manager of WBUR Podcasts.\r\n\r\nTheme music by me.\r\n\r\nOur managing producers are Samata Joshi for WBUR and Liz Stiles of ZSP.

Just kidding. But I am offering him information on Sophia’s case as it comes in. And he has been offering me his thoughts on ALL of it… in the form of voice memos.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia:  I'm just trying to understand like what was going through her head.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe’re several months into revisiting the murder at this point. It had become a sort of obsessive side project for both of us. I was reading documents and talking to Sophia regularly, usually in the early morning hours before my regular work day started.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Hi, good morning. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Hi, good morning. How you doing? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Did you get the stuff I sent ya? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I did, I did\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane is more of a night owl. Recording himself while he’s unwinding from his day at work…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: For the record, that's wine.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd pouring over his sister’s case file…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: First installment. Lots of pages.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTHOUSANDS of pages… witness interviews, call records, crime scene photos…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: This looks like it's an evidence form.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane is Sophia’s brother, obviously, but he’s also a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Hmm. Entry number 23. Paper bag with blood flakes\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd if he’s ever going to believe — REALLY believe — that his sister did not kill her mother-in-law…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: How many entries are there? Oh, there's a lotttttttttt of entries. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHe’s going to have to go through EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Even if she committed murder, I know that I love my sister... But she needs to be held accountable if she committed murder.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI’m Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair.\r\n\r\nChapter two: The Case\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the jury. The evidence in this case will show that on January 10th of 2002, Marlyne Johnson was brutally bludgeoned to death in her home.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI’ve fired up the footage of Sophia’s trial. That box of VHS tapes I got in the mail. On screen: a drab courtroom, grainy faces, outfits from 20 years ago, and… the prosecutor, delivering his opening statements.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: The evidence will show that she was bludgeoned to death by her own daughter-in-law, the defendant in this case, Sophia Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: All right. So, Clark County Sheriff's Office Enforcement Intelligence Information. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Shane is reading through Sophia’s case file…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: January 12th, 2002. This is two days after the murder.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd we each arrive at someone… VERY important.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: There's Rick Buckner…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDuffy: spell your last name for the record, please.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Bu-c-k-n-e-r.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRick Buckner. Detective Rick Buckner… whose decisions in the days following Marlyne’s murder solidified Sophia as the primary suspect.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I've been the lead investigator on probably anywhere from 45 to 50 homicide cases. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat was Rick on the stand in Sophia's trial in 2003. But this is him talking to ME.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Do you have a reputation in the field? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I'm a total asshole. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRick is big. And broad. Bald with a mustache. I’m sitting across from him in a small conference room in downtown Vancouver, Washington, which is near Portland, Oregon in Clark County.\r\n\r\nRick is cordial, but guarded. A little intimidating, if I'm being honest. Part of that may have to do with the polygraph machine I saw in his office next door. That's what he's been up to since retiring from the sheriff’s office -- he runs a private polygraph business. Which feels on brand. Because the thing I'D heard about Rick... is that he was the guy who could get suspects to TALK.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I've had people say they don't wanna talk to their attorney, they wanna talk to me. So that's pretty good. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nPeople like Keith Jesperson… AKA, the \"Happy Face Killer,\" who killed at least 8 women in the 90s and drew smiley faces on letters to police and the media.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: He wouldn't talk to us. And I said, come on Keith, I'll buy you dinner. Come on. But eventually he called me and says, yeah, I killed her. I've probably gotten more confessions than anybody else. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Rick NEVER got one… out of Sophia. He remembers her well… all these years later...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckber: So, is her position that she didn't do anything, that she didn't have any involvement in the death of, uh, Marlyne Johnson, or?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: It is, it is, and I know that, that you probably have a different perspective. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I do.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that Rick’s notes from this 20 year-old murder case are long gone, and it’s clearly one of MANY that he’s worked on, it's stayed with him.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I've seen a lot of crimes in my, you know, years as a detective. But to see this one where, I mean, this woman was just beaten, you know, beyond recognition, with, we determined later fireplace tongs. You know, and it was a vicious, vicious assault. Somebody wanted to make sure she was dead.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBuckner and his team started mapping out Marlyne’s movements the day of the murder. She’d gotten home a little before quarter-to-1 on that Thursday in January.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I think she came back from a yoga class that day. Yep. Went out grocery shopping. We had the grocery receipts in the bag so we could pretty much pinpoint the time that she actually would've arrived home. And by all, you know, indications, she just parked her car in the garage, came in from the garage into the house carrying groceries and somebody just viciously attacked her. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne hadn’t even set the bag in her arms down when she was struck by someone wielding fireplace tongs. She fell to the floor, groceries strewn around her. Marks and swelling on her hands and arms indicated that she'd tried to defend herself. The state’s forensic expert estimated she had been struck at least 9 times.\r\n\r\nMarlyne was beaten so forcefully that a piece of the fireplace tongs had broken off in the attack and was found next to her body. The cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull. The time, going by when Marlyne’s watch was broken and stopped, was 12:42pm. She was 58 years old.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: What steps did you then take, uh, with regard to, shall I say, managing the investigation at that time? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Well, first off, as a lead investigator, it's my responsibility to direct and guide the investigation to evaluate the information that comes in. I'm also responsible for the, the crucial interviews. So obviously we wanted to contact the family.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: Marlyne and I had a very, very tight bond. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Roylene. Marlyne’s sister.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: In fact, we made a pledge that we would never leave the state, we would never be long distance from each other ever. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Can you just tell me a little bit about your sister, who she was as a person, what things that she loved? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: Very, very trusting, which was something that I was, I'm very untrusting. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: The great love for family and nature would be definitely her. I mean, she fed the squirrels, she fed the deer, she fed the birds, she fed everything. Bags of peanuts and bags of bird seed and stuff for the deer. And it's like, oh my gosh. So, um, yes, very, um, loving person. No, not no mean bones in her body. I got 'em all.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRoylene is 15 years YOUNGER than Marlyne, but she often found herself feeling like she needed to look out for her loving, trusting, generous older sister.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: She'd go for long walks, love to walk, love to hike, I stressed about it all the time. I told her always to take protection. She said, there's nothing out there. I said, there's men and wild animals.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: She'd go by herself? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRoylene Hamilton: Yes. Go by herself with a little Yorkshire terrier. Like that's gonna protect anything. I had to protect her from so many people because if you said, geez, I wished I had a dollar. She'd give you 10. I was very, very protective of my sister because she was so kind and thought there was something good in everybody. And to me, I'm the opposite. You have to prove to me that there's something good in you. Otherwise, I don't think you’re good at all. And her, she thinks everybody's good. You have to prove to her that you're not.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSomeone did prove that to Marlyne. Likely, someone she knew. But WHO... that was Detective Buckner's job.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: And did you conduct a series of interviews over the next day or so? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Yes, I did. I interviewed Brad, Sophia Johnson, Richard Johnson. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad, Sophia's husband, Marlyne's son. And Richard, Marlyne's husband. Now widower.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: So we asked everybody, you know, what was your day like, what did you do, who were you talking to? Those kind of things. Do you know of anybody that could have done something like this? Anybody that would've wanted to hurt Marlyne. I mean, she was a housewife. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Do you remember any kind of first reactions from those first conversations that you had with Richard and Brad and Sophia?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: All of them were very distraught. Brad Johnson was beside himself in the fact that he had just discovered his mother. Brad had gone in through the back door, I think it was cause he couldn't get in through the garage door and found his mother laying there bludgeoned to death.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEarly interviews with family members filled out the events of the day, but they weren't all that illuminating in terms of the WHY of it all.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: So then we were pretty much at square one. You know, who would've done this? I mean, what are we looking at? Is it some kind of a robbery gone bad? Is it a burglary in the house?  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSometimes in an investigation, you have to seek out all of the leads. And sometimes, as Buckner told the jury, a lead… comes to you.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner:  9-1-1 had received an anonymous phone call from a payphone and the person refused to give their name or anything. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut they did eventually give a name the detectives could work with... Sean Correia. Not Shane. SEAN. The middle brother of the Correia children. 4 years younger than Sophia, 6 years older than Shane.\r\n\r\nSean, this anonymous caller said… he knew… SOMETHING about Marlyne's murder. Or maybe DID something?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: How did your investigation proceed based upon what you were told? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Based on what we were told, our investigation focused on Sean Correia at that time and Sophia Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean AND Sophia... because, as Detective Buckner told me.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: There is no connection between Marlyne Johnson and Sean Correia. The only connection is Sophia Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd Sean had a story for the detectives that was about to fully connect the dots FOR them.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Eventually he said that he didn't actually do it, but he was there when it happened and that his sister is the one that actually bludgeoned Marlyne Johnson to death.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMore in a minute.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12th, 2002, two days after Marlyne Johnson, Sophia's mother-in-law, was found bludgeoned to death with fireplace tongs in her own home, Sean Correia was in custody. But he didn’t murder Marlyne, he said. His sister did, and he was willing to cooperate with detective Rick Buckner.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: After Sean was arrested, we decided to go ahead and see if he could skip a call into his sister Sophia and get her to admit something on the telephone. We structured it a little bit.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nStructured it a little bit... or as he would tell the jury...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: We had scripted what we thought Sophia Johnson would believed, and we wrote out what we wanted Sean to say.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd that call, of course, was recorded.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Hello? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: Hey Sophia. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Hi. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: How you doing? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Doing good. How are you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I'm doing great. Um, hey, uh, like I need to talk to you. Can, like, is it possible for me to talk to you where nobody’s at? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Yeah. You wanna come over? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: No, I can't really come over right now.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt was the day of Marlyne's funeral. Sophia and Brad had close family over at their house when this call from Sean came in. And he was, seemingly, falling apart.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Sophia, I'm tripping out. Okay. I don't want these people to think that I did anything, man. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Sean, why would anybody think that you did anything? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: These, these people are asking me questions. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Sean, everybody's being asked questions.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe recording’s a little hard to understand in places, but Sean tells Sophia he doesn’t want anyone to think he did anything, he’s being asked questions... Sophia tells him, EVERYONE’s being questioned right now.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: What am I supposed to do, Sophia? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Sean? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Yes? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Calm down. Calm down. Okay.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI've tried to picture what it must have been like being on all sides of this call. Sean with a script and a phone hooked up to some sort of recording device... sweating, maybe. 19 years old, definitely in \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e kind of trouble, surrounded by detectives on the edge of their seats. Detectives who have \u003cem\u003enothing\u003c/em\u003e on Sophia at this point, EXCEPT… Sean’s word. This call \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e be their big break. And Sophia, 23 years old, maybe holding her 6-month pregnant belly, tucked away in a corner of her house, with her husband, father-in-law, and the rest of the Marlyne's nearest and dearest grieving close by. Listening to her brother say increasingly troubling things…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I don't want to be a part of this, Sophia. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to be a part of this, Sophia,” Sean says.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnon: Sean, what are you saying? You are really scaring me, stop it. Relax. Stop it right now. Okay? You are worrying me and you were scaring me because I'm not understanding what you're saying. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Sean doesn't stop. He dances around WHATever, exactly, was done by WHOever for about 4 minutes. Until... finally... he says this.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: If these people find out that we had anything to do with this. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Excuse me?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“If these people find out that we had anything to do with this…”\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: What? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: If these people find out that we had anything to do with this, we’re gonna go to jail. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Sean, what are you saying? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I'm telling you, I think they know.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd then, Sophia asks…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Sophia, I'm tripping out. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Do you need me to get you an attorney? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“Do you need me to get you an attorney?”\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Man, I don't know. I just need some help, man. Look, Sophia, I don't wanna go down for something I didn't do, man. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“I don’t wanna go down for something I didn’t do,” Sean says.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Okay. I'm tripping out. Sophia, what am I supposed to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe'll be coming back to this call. Just like the attorneys in this case would keep coming back to this call. In part because of what happened next. Sophia placed a call of her own. To detective Rick Buckner.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: She said it was, I just received a phone, a strange phone call from my brother, you know, I don't know what's going on. And she kind of downplayed the whole thing.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Well did you do anything? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Wait a minute, do you think he’s involved in the death of Marlyne Johnson? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: You know, I don’t. I really don’t think he’s capable of something like that. I don’t know what his motive would be. He never really knew her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: She didn't come right out and say, my brother killed Marlyne Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut she \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e say she'd head down to the police station to share more of what she'd heard. Or, at least, that's all she THOUGHT she’d be doing…\r\n\r\nSophia and Brad went down to the sheriff’s office together. They thought they’d be questioned together… as they had been the day of the murder. But this time, Detective Buckner told them he and his team wanted to talk to Sophia… alone.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I am not in there for very long when this thing takes an awful turn. They said, you know, when we're doing these types of investigations, we look into everybody, right? And I said, yes, I do know. And they said, including you? And I said, yeah. And then they started asking me a series of other questions. I would answer, and they would say, well, of course, that's very self-serving. And then when I didn't know the answer, they would say that that's an excellent answer. The perfect answer in a murder investigation is, I don't know. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWhen Sophia says \"they,\" she mostly means Rick Buckner. Who took the lead in this interview.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Phony, if you will. It sounded phony. The whole thing sounded phony\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia JohnsinL I felt like I was being attacked. I felt confused. I was afraid.   The interrogation lasted for probably about four hours. And then they said that they were charging me with murder and Rick Buckner looked at me like, I know you did it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia was fingerprinted and booked into Clark County Jail.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: This female officer said, I booked your brother in. And he said, you did it. And I thought, what? She said, yeah, he's the one saying you did it. Don't you know this information? He's telling everybody you did it, girl.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTrial footage: Ready for the next witness? Yes. The state calls Sean Correia.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt's now April of 2003. Sophia has been in jail for the last 15 months. She's given birth to a baby boy nearly a year prior, and hasn't seen him since. Sean has been in jail, too, but he's just gotten out on a deal: His freedom in exchange for his testimony, against his sister… who's on trial for first degree murder.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTrial footage: Come forward please \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nA jury of 9 women and 3 men are about to hear what happened the day of Marlyne Johnson's murder\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTrial footage: Raise your right hand \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nfrom the brother who says he witnessed it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTrial footage: Do you swear to tell the truth in today's proceedings?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Yes, I do. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean is on the stand for three and a half hours... so I’ll summarize his version of events. You’re gonna want to listen closely...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Do you recall what time of day you left your residence to go over to Sophia's?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean says he had gone to Sophia's house early that morning with his girlfriend, Susie. He was technically married to ANOTHER woman at the time, and Sophia had agreed to help him file for divorce.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: She told me she would help me fill out the paperwork and she would give me the money to file the papers\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMoney that Sophia suddenly realizes… she doesn’t have on her. She tells Sean that the money is in the pocket of a coat she'd left at her in-laws' house the day before.\r\n\r\nSean says that Susie then drives the three of them over to Marlyne's house to go get the coat.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did you know the way out there? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: No. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Who was directing the route to be taken? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Sophia. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSusie testifies to that as well, by the way. No one was home at the Johnsons’. Sophia’s father-in-law was at work, Marlyne was at yoga, then the grocery store. Sophia has a key, but after about 10 minutes in the house, she comes out WITHOUT the coat. She can’t find it. So Seans says that he and Susie start driving Sophia back to her house — before he had to go work at Wendy's and Susie had to babysit — when Sophia says...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Wait a minute, can you pull over so I can think for a second?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia proposes a new plan, according to Sean. Sean, I'll give you more money LATER if you call out of work, come BACK to my in-laws' house with me, and help me clean their carpets.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I thought about it for a minute. I didn't miss no work before and, you know, I figured I can get the money, go file for my divorce and have it all taken care of in a day. So I said, okay. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis… is kind of a weird plot point, right? Skipping work to clean carpets... at your sister’s in-laws’ house? It’s a fishy story that either Sophia cooked up for Sean, or that Sean cooked up for detectives. And was NOW feeding to a jury.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did you then in fact, go back to the Johnson residence?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Yes, we did.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAgain, no one was home. Pretty soon after they get there, Seans says, Sophia admits: there are no carpets to clean. I made it up. And she starts looking around for something. Her coat, with the money in the pocket, Sean assumes. But then...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: She said that Marlyne had $10,000 stashed in some, uh, place in her house.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTen thousand dollars. Sean was sitting on the steps between the main level of the house and the upper level, where he says Sophia was looking around for this hidden stash of cash. But her search was cut short... by the sound of the garage door opening. Marlyne was home.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: Sophia was on the upper level and she hustled by me and she told me, wait right here.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean says he did as he was told while Sophia went somewhere downstairs. About 5 minutes went by, and THEN Sean says… he heard a weird noise.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: It was kind of like a low screech in a sense, \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did you hear any words that you understood? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Corria: Uh, no. I just got a little curious.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSo Sean got up and went downstairs, to the ground level of the house where he thought the low screech must have come from. And that, Sean says, is when things really took a turn.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: As I got to the bottom of the stairs, I felt something wet drop on me. I wasn't sure what it was. I wiped my face and I just kind of wiped it on my shirt. And as I was looking and as I turned to the left, I seen someone laying on the floor and there was blood all over the place. And there was someone standing over them. The person had, um, something in their hand, a long object. And as I looked, I seen the person standing over the body on the floor. Uh, strike it one time. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Striking the body on the floor? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: Yes.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean says he didn't recognize the person standing over Marlyne's body at first. But as he ran towards a sliding door to get away, he heard the person yell his name.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: And when I turned around, I saw the person that was standing over the body coming toward me. And then the person kind of took, it was like stalking off their face and it turned out to be my sister.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis day in court, Sophia told me, was the first time she was hearing Sean tell this story.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: And I looked at the jury and I could see that they were listening to what he was saying. But I couldn't move, I couldn't cry, I couldn't scream. I was paralyzed.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd THIS…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRecording: It turned out to be… my sister.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTHIS was the first time Shane was hearing his brother’s testimony… on my laptop in his apartment, during that particular visit that left him restless.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Are there any initial kind of gut reactions one way or the other? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Um, I mean, really? This person is so unrecognizable that you see their outline committing a brutal crime, and you're like, who is that? Like that's, that's odd, right? Like it doesn't seem to pass the smell test.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe kept watching…\r\n\r\nFrom there, Sean says Sophia told him to get into the passenger's seat of Marlyne's van and keep his head down.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: I was really scared. I, she told me just to stay quiet and not say anything, and I, you know, I was crying. I didn't know what else to do.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia drove them back to her house, Sean says. She could see blood on his undershirt and pants. So Sophia took the shirt and gave Sean a pair of her husband Brad's pants to change into. Then Sean says, she instructed him to drive the van to a particular parking lot where he'd be able to catch a bus home.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: She also let me know that my daughter lived not too far from where she was. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did you take that as an implied threat? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: You know, I wasn't sure how to take that. I didn't know what to do at this point. I just figured I better just listen.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I wanted to tear his head off his body. Just the blatant lies with me in the courtroom with him. He could say such awful things about me. I don't know when it was over.  But I knew my life was over. I knew they made him out to be this weak, sweet Boy Scout. And I was Satan's sister. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Sean, did you kill Marlyne Johnson? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: No. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Thank you. No further questions at this time. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Anything about the way that he's speaking that jumps out at you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: He sounds coached, which makes sense. You have to prepare for trial. So that's just good work. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane told me… that hearing his brother’s version of events, finally… left him MORE confused.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: There are a lot of details. To me, the story doesn't make a ton of sense.  It sounds like something you would see on TV for someone who's coming up with a story.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean’s audience in the courtroom that day… didn’t get much insight into WHO the Correia siblings were…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: The way Sean was presented to a jury, it was as if he had never been in trouble.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nOr, who they were to EACH OTHER, and how they got that way.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I don't know if I'm just, because I'm so close to them that I would be shocked, but— \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBUT… that’s where I’m going. And I’m taking you with me. To places the jury didn’t get to go. To people they never heard from.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia Molina: I have no doubt in my mind that he killed that woman. I have no doubt because he almost did it to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat's next time.\r\n\r\nBeyond All Repair is a production of WBUR, Boston’s NPR, and ZSP Media.\r\n\r\nIt’s written and reported by me, Amory Sivertson, and produced by Sofie Kodner.\r\n\r\nMix, sound design and original scoring by Paul Vaitkus, production manager of WBUR Podcasts.\r\n\r\nTheme and credits music by me.\r\n\r\nOur managing producers are Samata Joshi for WBUR and Liz Stiles of ZSP.

She doesn’t show, leading Sophia and Brad to check on her, and, ultimately, to her lifeless, nearly unrecognizable body.\r\n\r\nSophia denies murdering Marlyne, but suspects Sean’s involvement.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about the case, the real people at the center of this story, or anything else about this series, we want to hear them.

But to see this one where this woman was just beaten beyond recognition…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: And it turned out to be my sister.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I wanted to tear his head off his body. Just the blatant lies.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Even if my sister committed murder, I know that I still love her. But she also needs to be held accountable if she committed murder. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I never want my son to think that, ‘Mom, I love you anyway.’ That is not the right answer. That's not the right answer.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: This is Shane. I am just getting ready to read the psychology report.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane Correia is, once again, recording a voice memo for me. He’s the lawyer in New York City, remember… and like you’d hope a lawyer would be, Shane is or-ga-NIZED. He’s been a thorough record-keeper for pretty much his whole life. It’s kept him safe, he says. Like a fortress against gaslighting, helping him believe a life full of unbelievable family events. And Shane has in front of him right now… a document that I’m not sure anyone in his family even knows still exists...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I've read this so many times over the past I guess almost two and a half decades. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane is about to re-read a court-ordered psychological evaluation of the Correia family. HIS family. It was done in 1997… 5 years before Marlyne Johnson was murdered. Shane was 9 years old at the time of this report. Sophia was 18. Twice his age. Sean, his brother, was 14. So, in the middle, more or less. None of the Correias were in Washington state, where the murder occurred, yet. They were all still living in the Bronx, but they were not all living TOGETHER. This psych eval… explains a LOT.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: All right, so I'll just read the reason for referral. This is in the matter of Correia v. Correia. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane’s parents — referred to as Mr. and Ms. Correia throughout the report — were getting a divorce. They had already been separated for a few years. The kids were separated, too.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: The couple's only daughter, Sophia, lives with her mother and Shane. Mr. Correia expressed hostility toward the two women.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHostility that, like father like son, Ms. Correia says was passed down to Sean.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Ms. Correia blames Mr. Correia for Sean's delinquent behavior. She and Sean got into a battle and Sean called the police who sided with the mother. At that time, Sean went to live with the father and stopped going to school. According to Ms. Correia, Sean was dealing with drugs. In relating the story about her son, there was an icy cold quality, particularly when she stated that Sean cannot come back to her, that he steals from her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean steals, his mother says. But also, that he’s gotten physical.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Eventually, Sean struck her, so she filed for a PINS petition. A PINS petition, by the way, is in the state of New York, a person in need of supervision. It's if law enforcement hasn't come to intercept your kids, then you try to go to family court and get the court's help.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat PINS petition… didn’t go anywhere, Shane says. Sean went to go live with his dad. But Shane, the youngest? He was staying with their mom. And she was there, talking to a psychologist for the state of New York, to make SURE of it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: George Correia, the father of Shane Correia, me, is petitioning for visitation rights. He states that the mother is pressuring the boy not to visit with him.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis pressure — if that is, in fact, the right word here — seems clearly out of concern. Because as Sophia told this psychologist…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: She believes that the father is responsible for Sean's antisocial behavior and that, given Shane, the father would accomplish the same. Thank you, Sophia!\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe gratitude Shane feels… is because, in Correia vs. Correia 1997, Mr. Correia wasn’t granted visitation rights. Shane credits Sophia and his mom for that. For protecting him from his dad… Because, as he himself told the psychologist,\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: He stated that he's afraid that he would become like his brother Sean.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWho is the Sean that Sophia was afraid of Shane becoming? That Shane was afraid of becoming? So much so that the Correia family remains divided TODAY. Physically… emotionally… intentionally. How do Sean and Sophia, siblings at odds since childhood, end up accusing each other of murder? I was starting to get an idea…\r\n\r\nI'm Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair.\r\n\r\nChapter Three: Bad Blood.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: Ms. Lavallee. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Thank you, your Honor. I stand here on behalf of Sophia Johnson to deliver this opening statement. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nYou know, at least in part, how this sibling he-said-she-said turned out. With Sophia on trial in 2003, a year after her mother-in-law’s brutal murder. In her opening statement, Sophia’s lawyer, Therese Lavallee, made the point that Sean and Sophia had been estranged up until just one week before Marlyne Johnson was killed.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Sophia and Sean had not spoken to one another. For months. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Just because we have the same two parents Does not mean we like each other. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThose same two parents… who didn’t like each other \u003cem\u003eeither\u003c/em\u003e. And who also had a history of he-said-she-saids, according to the family psych evaluation.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Regarding visitation, Mr. Correia stated that he sees both Sophia and Shane regularly while the mother, Sophia and Shane insists that there have been no visitation for more than three years. Thus, there are many indications of contradictory data.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe case against Sophia rested on Sean's word… that he saw his sister standing over Marlyne with fireplace tongs.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: This is a story that was concocted by Correia to save himself from the charge of murder in the first degree.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: He would do anything to save his own skin, so I definitely don’t trust his testimony at all. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAccording to Shane, AND Sophia… if you wanna understand WHY Sean said what did on the stand, you need to know who he was to them … growing up.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: There's a reason this little son of a bitch who I happen to be related to is up here lying. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIn some ways, Sophia and Sean have been through a lot together. They were both born in Guyana. It’s the only South American country where English is the official language — sandwiched between Venezuela and Suriname. The Correias have a rich ethnic background, as many Guyanese people do. There’s Chinese heritage, Indian, Portuguese. You’d never be able to visually pinpoint the Correia siblings to a particular nationality, but you’d connect ‘em to each other, alright. Light brown skin, dark brown eyes, jet black hair. An attractive bunch with a deeply complicated history… and maybe an even MORE complicated present? Little teaser for ya: Sean ran for president of Guyana at one point… and he’s contemplating another run right now. He’s made his presence known down there. And on YouTube. Buuuut I’m getting ahead of myself.\r\n\r\nThe Correia family came to the U.S. from Guyana when Sophia and Sean were pretty young. 6 and 2 years old maybe?, Sophia thinks. They eventually settled into a brownstone in the South Bronx with other relatives.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: There was constant screaming in the house\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Sophia in our very first conversation back in 2021. Remember her analogy for her life up to this point? A house full of boxes. Not knowing where to start unpacking. How about your parents, I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eThey, um, they created the two of them, a very toxic environment for all of us. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBoth Sophia and Shane attribute much of this toxicity to their\u003cem\u003e father\u003c/em\u003e, specifically. 9 year-old Shane described violence in the home to the psychologist conducting the family evaluation in 1997.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eHe also stated that the last time he saw his father, Mr. Correia slapped his sister and called his mother a whore.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia and Shane have separately told me many of the same stories about their father’s aggression. Thrown fists. Thrown plates. Shane told me about a time his dad threatened him with a knife, which his dad DENIES, but Shane DID call the police on him at the time… and he’s kept that report, too. Still… it’s clear the emotional scars of the Correia kids’ collective childhood run deeper. There was name-calling by their dad, Sophia and Shane say. Often of a misogynistic or denigrating nature. Once Shane came out to his dad…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I was cocksucker or faggot. Like that was my name from 13 to 18. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And that really, that really does something to a child. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe Correia parents worked long hours, so Sophia took on the role of guardian. Not legally, but literally. Mostly to Shane. As for \u003cem\u003eSean\u003c/em\u003e…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Sean is dad's kid, like 100% \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIf Sophia was the protector, Shane says Sean was the instigator.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: He was, selfish, advantageous, and didn't give a shit about the impacts\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd, as their mother claimed in the psychological evaluation, Sean could get physical, like his dad. Shane told me about a time that he went after Sophia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I remember him picking up a bat, and he took it to my sister, to the point where my sister is screaming. Shane, call the police and I run downstairs. Call nine one one. They're like, what's your address?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane was young enough at the time that he didn’t actually KNOW their address.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: and I'm screaming to Sophia while she's like, fighting off Sean with a baseball bat. Sophia, what's our address? I, I called the cops before I knew where I lived because of Sean.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: When I was growing up, my sister raised me. My sister made sure to get me to school. She took me an hour out of her way to take me to my special school so that I didn't miss it and I could keep going. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Sophia couldn’t do it alone. And when help came literally knocking… Jehovah’s Witnesses going door to door… she answered.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And so I made the decision. I made the decision to go to the Kingdom Hall with them three times a week, which is what their meetings are, and take Shane with me so that we would be safe while my mother was at work. It was peaceful. It was safe, and at times boring as hell. But, it taught me to be a little bit more confident.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEventually, Sophia met her first husband through the religion. This guy… wasn't the love of her life, Sophia says, but marriage was an opportunity to get out of the Bronx and further from her father and Sean. MUCH further. Her husband’s family was from Washington state. And she agreed to move there…IF… her mom and Shane could come with them.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And we made this agreement and moved across the country. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt was 1998. A year after that family psych evaluation was done. Sophia was now 19 years old and newly married, and she, Shane, and her mom felt like they’d been given a fresh start. Things seemed hopeful for the first time in a LONG time. But within 6 months, one of their problems would follow them to Washington.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: So it was my grandmother who called and she said, you guys are so far away and Sean really needs help. Can you please help your brother? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean was getting into a lot of trouble in New York, Sophia says. And he had either dropped out of school or gotten kicked out. He needed a chance at a fresh start too, their grandmother pleaded.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I know that if he just got away from his father and all of this stuff in New York, the influence that maybe he can have a shot at a life. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAs much as Sophia disliked Sean, she \u003cem\u003eloved\u003c/em\u003e her grandmother, her dad’s mom. She lived with them when they were all in the Bronx brownstone. It was for her \u003cem\u003egrandmother\u003c/em\u003e that Sophia says she got Sean enrolled in high school out in Washington and convinced her mother to take him in. Give him a second chance. It was for grandmother that she brought Sean to the Kingdom Hall with her to try to give him more of a community and moral foundation. And Sophia \u003cem\u003ethought\u003c/em\u003e it was working… until one day, Sean came to her in the middle of a school day… and he wasn’t alone.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And he said, this is my girlfriend, Cynthia. We're in trouble. And I'm like, okay, what is it? He said, um, I think she's pregnant.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: I was like, head over heels for this boy at 16.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Cynthia\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: he would walk me to class. He would carry my books and he used to say that he used to sing, so he started singing something. Don't ask me what it was cuz I did not understand it. And I was like, oh, he sang to me. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s how Cynthia remembers Sean in the beginning of their young love. THIS is how she talks about him today.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: He's somebody that's manipulative, um, a pathological liar. Somebody that, uh, it's abusive. Uh, somebody that doesn't take no for an answer.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt took starry-eyed Cynthia a little while to see what her parents seemed to pick up on right away about Sean.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: My family did not accept Sean whatsoever. Um, My family basically disowned me because of him for, you know, a while. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEven \u003cem\u003eSean's\u003c/em\u003e mom took Cynthia's parents’ side.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: She told me, she goes, your mom's right, your mom's right not to like Sean. He's not doing anything good with his life.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nOne example of this? Pretty soon after moving out to Washington state when he was 16, Sean was found guilty of a hit-and-run, which he’d gotten into using his mom’s car, taken without permission, and without a driver’s license. So yeah, a bad boy… in a long, black leather jacket, talking smoothe to Cynthia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: There was times where he kind of spoke in like a, a different accent and half the time I was like, I don't know what you're saying, but it sounds so good. You know, just because–\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: What kind of an accent? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: Kind of like the people that sing reggae. That type of accent. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThere’s this one picture of Cynthia and Sean from around this time that may as well be captioned: Rebels in romance. They both have these satisfied, closed-mouth smiles. Sean has one arm around her, the other clasped in her hand. The epitome of teenage toughness… except for one little dimple that gives Cynthia away.\r\n\r\nBut she really did get disowned by her parents when she got pregnant, Cynthia says. Or at least, kicked out of their house. The young couple hopped around. They stayed with some of Cynthia’s friends, who sent ‘em packing when they suspected Sean was stealing from them, she says. They spent some time in a shelter. Sean had trouble holding down a job, Still, they got married. Cynthia says Sophia let her wear her wedding dress and planned a baby shower for her.\r\n\r\nBut things got even worse between Sean and Cynthia after their daughter was born. Cynthia says he would force himself on her sexually. Punch holes in walls. When she’d confront him, Sean would have a seizure in the heat of the argument, Cynthia says. One time, it seemed like he’d hit the ground hard.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: And one of the paramedics actually pulled me aside and he goes, you, I need to tell you this, but he's faking it. And that's the first moment where I was just like, what?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAccording to Sophia, Sean’s own mother has claimed that he would FAKE seizures, by the way. But real or not, Cynthia was starting to worry about safety. Sophia took her and her infant daughter in for a period of time.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: She treated me like a sister. She never, ever like looked down on me. I, I do remember when I first met her, she said, why are you with my brother? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWhen Sean found out Cynthia was staying with Sophia, he was livid. Sophia says he’d call her house, accusing her of trying to keep him from his daughter. It got to the point where Sophia ended up changing her home phone number. It was the beginning of a months-long estrangement in a sibling relationship that had been strained practically their whole lives.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the end for Cynthia and Sean… and she says his aggression escalated.\r\n\r\nOne incident in particular led her to try to get a restraining order. She dates it in her petition for an order of protection to July 29, 2001. Their daughter was 10 months old. Cynthia says she was holding her when an argument with Sean turned violent.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: He picked me up, he pulled me up by the hair and then he slams me to the wall and he picked me up by the neck and slammed me over and over with my daughter and arms.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nCynthia says she feared for her life in that moment. She details another incident a couple months earlier when she says Sean punched her and threatened to kill her, saying he was going to take their daughter.\r\n\r\nCynthia’s restraining order was denied. “Insufficient evidence of imminent danger of physical harm,” the report concludes. It was another he-said-she-said. But she was DONE.\r\n\r\nFast-forward 6 months… to January of 2002. Cynthia and Sean are separated, but still technically married. Sean is eager to get a divorce because he has a girlfriend, Susie… who’s 5 months pregnant. He doesn’t have the money for the divorce, though. Sean is 19 at this point, he’s making minimum wage at Wendy’s, he’s living with Susie in her mom’s apartment, he’s soon to become a father of two… AND he’s upwards of $40,000 in debt from unpaid medical bills. Seizure-related… he claims.\r\n\r\nCynthia says she gets a call from a friend one day around this time… who tells her to sit down and turn on the news.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eNews Clip: Clark County Sheriff's deputies believe Sophia Johnson and her brother, Sean Correa, murdered a brush prairie woman. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: And my first reaction was like, wow. Like, he almost killed me. And then I have to like face my parents to be like, you were right. He… I could have been his first victim. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nCynthia went to her parents, but that’s about it, she says. She’s really only talking to me now because her daughter’s an adult.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: I've never told her everything, never told her that her dad raped me time and time again, which at the time I thought it was my duty cause that was his wife. I never told her that he hurt me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean has DENIED this allegation. And others of a similar nature. And you WILL get to hear from him in his own words down the line…\r\n\r\nBut you know who else never heard about the Sean Cynthia says she knew? The JURY in Sophia’s trial. Despite Sophia pleading with her attorney, she says, to put Cynthia on the stand.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: I don't know why Cynthia did not testify, why she was never called by the defense.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI do. Or… I at least have an idea. Sophia’s lawyer, Therese Lavallee, hasn’t wanted to talk on the record. But I have a window into her strategy with regards to Sean: Sophia’s trial footage. Which includes the pre-trial hearings, where decisions were made about what evidence and testimony the judge would, and would NOT, allow the jury to hear.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Your Honor, to reiterate, our argument is that this all goes to his motive to lie and to commit this crime. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s Therese in a particular hearing that her opponent, the prosecutor, referred to as a “character impeachment” of Sean.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: It's an attempt by the defense to besmirch and portray Sean Correia as this bad character. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSean, remember was the key witness testifying AGAINST Sophia. The prosecution needed him to appear \u003cem\u003ecredible\u003c/em\u003e. Reliable. A victim in this whole mess. But Therese, AKA the defense…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: The evidence we can show directly contradicts that.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSHE had information suggesting that Sean was none of those things leading up to Marlyne Johnson’s murder. She’d heard the stories of impulsive violence, she knew about accusations \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e recent charges against him for theft. About the debt hanging over Sean’s head. About the bad blood between the siblings turned \u003cem\u003eworse\u003c/em\u003e,\r\n\r\nAND… Therese had \u003cem\u003espoken\u003c/em\u003e to Cynthia \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e her \u003cem\u003emother\u003c/em\u003e, who’d told her about a time when Sean tried to extort her for $50,000, saying…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: If you write me a check for that amount of money, I'll divorce your daughter and not ever fight for custody of the child.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese was ready to share the many shades of Sean with the jury — all of which she said potentially \u003cem\u003emotivated\u003c/em\u003e him to burglarize the Johnsons’ home, made him \u003cem\u003ecapable\u003c/em\u003e of killing Marlyne, AND… \u003cem\u003eblaming\u003c/em\u003e it on the sister who’d betrayed him by taking in the wife who’d fled him in fear. And Therese WANTED Cynthia to be able to share her experience with Sean on the witness stand. An opportunity that, Cynthia says, she would have taken. \u003cem\u003eEspecially\u003c/em\u003e given whose character \u003cem\u003eSean\u003c/em\u003e was about to impeach at trial.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eCynthia: There's no way. There's no way Sophia was a part of that.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut the prosecutor argued… that all of this… was PREJUDICIAL.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Our courts have defined unfair prejudice as quote, ‘more likely to arouse an emotional response than a rational decision by a jury. ‘\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: I should be entitled to explore Sean Correia’s motivation, his own personal motivations for committing this crime. Because if I'm not allowed to do that, then essentially what we're dealing with is a kid who says, I was just tagging along with my sister. You see, your Honor, and once he gets caught, once he gets caught, then he starts pointing the finger at my client. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nUltimately, her Honor… sided with the prosecutor. Sean’s history? Irrelevant. He wasn’t on trial for murder. His sister was.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: Granted he's not necessarily a very nice person, But what does that have to do with the particular facts of this case other than his admissions to the behaviors and the crimes that he's committed?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Then my client is being denied a fair trial.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis story, in large part, is about which of these two siblings you believe. And after learning more about Sean’s backstory, I did find myself questioning his version of events. But the jury… wouldn’t know any of it. They'd just hear Sean telling his side of the story. They wouldn’t get that… for Sophia. Not in her words, anyway. But you will. In a minute.\r\n\r\nCynthia, who says Sean was her high school dreamboat-turned-husband-turned-nightmare… wasn’t the only one exiting a relationship in the early aughts. Sophia’s “arrangement” with \u003cem\u003eher\u003c/em\u003e husband in the Jehovah’s Witness community was starting to feel… about as exciting to her as any relationship you might refer to as an “arrangement.” Sophia was getting attention from a guy she’d met through work. His name was Brad Johnson. She was 21 at the time. He was 33.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I'd never experienced that level of attraction in my life. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia fell hard and fast. She filed for divorce from her husband, not realizing how much she’d end up divorced from. Because adultery in the eyes of her Kingdom Hall was grounds for expulsion from the religion. Disfellowshipment it’s called. And it meant that other Jehovah’s Witnesses weren’t allowed to maintain contact with her. Even the two people who, up to that point, Sophia had been closest to.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: First Corinthians 1533: Do not be misled. Bad associations spoils useful habits.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: My mom and Shane, I couldn't understand that one. because we're still family. And yet I gave them the space because I knew that they were doing what they were being told was the right thing to do and didn't hate them for it. I was just really hurt by it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a really isolating period in Sophia’s life. Amid all the hostility and volatility of her upbringing, she’d always, ALWAYS, had her mom and Shane. So now, Sophia looked to a new, chosen family.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Marlyne was my best friend.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne Johnson, Brad’s mom.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I started to not just love Brad, but I really loved his family.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHis mom and I started playing dress up and she totally got into it. She had all these wigs with all these styles and I was like, oh, this is so great. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad was an only child, which meant Sophia was like the daughter Marlyne never had. And Marlyne was… not \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e mother Sophia never had, but \u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e mother she never had. One who didn’t work all day. Who let her do her make-up. Who watched movies with her and gossipped. Who let her feel just… like a DAUGHTER after so many years of being a motherlike figure to her kid brother. And, Marlyne was the mother who was actually \u003cem\u003etalking\u003c/em\u003e to her, which she desperately needed as a young woman in arrested development – playing dress-up by day with her future mother-in-law and diving deeper by night into her relationship with her older, irresistibly attractive future husband.\r\n\r\nThe not-too-distant future, either. Within months of separating from her first husband…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: We were newlyweds and then I was pregnant.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nFlip it and reverse it, but yeah. Marlyne was going to become a grandmother the following Spring.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: She was so excited about her first grandchild.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s an understatement, from what I’ve heard from some of Marlyne’s friends. And this mother and daughter-in-law were about to go into business together. An event planning business… called Best Friends. For real. It was like Sophia had been given another chance to start over. She didn’t have her mom and Shane with her this time, but she had the Johnsons…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: All of them were incredible to me. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShe was just about ready to put that other life — and maybe, that family? — behind her… when she got a call. From her grandmother. Again. Saying her brother Sean needed her help. Again. This time with his divorce paperwork. He also wanted to start over. And Sophia, her grandmother suggested, just might need \u003cem\u003ehim\u003c/em\u003e, too.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Your mother isn't speaking to you, Shane isn't speaking to you. You have only this new man's family. Why don't you try to cultivate something with your brother who's so willing and his girl is pregnant and maybe you guys can form a relationship. You need to have a support system.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut the last time Sophia had heard from Sean, she says, he was spewing vitriol by phone for taking Cynthia and his daughter in. She and Brad had, in fact. Why should she help him out now, after 6 months of Sean-free living? The same reason she did last time, Sophia says. Grandma Correia mind tricks.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And so I did, despite my best judgment. And if there's one thing I could change in my life right now, where I know I made the wrong choice, it was that. That decision altered the course of my life.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, 2002 was a pretty typical Thursday. Brad went to work, like usual, Sophia says. She stayed home, like usual. But unlike usual, Sean and his pregnant girlfriend were expected at her house at 8:30 in the morning to go over his divorce paperwork. So the siblings’ stories match, so far. Including the part about Sophia agreeing to give Sean the money to file his divorce papers, and realizing… she didn’t have it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I thought, oh, shoot, okay, well I'll have to give this to you tomorrow because I left my, I was over at Marlyne's last night and I left, I must have left my coat there because I couldn't find it anywhere at my house. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, as someone who has experienced Washington state in winter, it’s a litttttle hard to imagine how you forget your coat in January. But Sophia says… there was a reason for this.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I know exactly. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Oh, really? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia had spent the day before at Marlyne’s house. This was pretty common. She was waiting for a ride home from Brad when her in-laws… started arguing. \u003cem\u003eAlso\u003c/em\u003e pretty common, Sophia says.\r\n\r\nMarlyne suspected that her husband had started drinking again. Sophia says things got heated between Marlyne and her father-in-law. And when Brad arrived to pick her up from his parents house…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I'm like, we gotta get outta here. This is not good. We gotta get outta here. They're fighting. And uh, he's like, oh, great. Okay. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd so, Sophia says, in trying to get out the door quickly… her coat didn’t make it with her.\r\n\r\nNo big deal. Marlyne is coming over for lunch that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And in fact, I called Marlyne And she informed me that she was going to do a yoga class and that she'd come home and shower, get ready, and she'd make a note to bring my coat.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Sean can’t wait around for the cash coat. He has to go to work, his girlfriend has to babysit. And THIS is where the siblings’ stories diverge. Remember, Sean says this is when his girlfriend drives him and Sophia TO her in-laws' house to get the coat. SOPHIA says, Sean and his girlfriend just… leave. But not totally empty-handed. Sophia says there are bags of clothing by her door.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I mentioned to Sean, ‘Hey, you know, these are going out for donations. They're good stuff. It's just that it cannot fit us, or we know we won't ever need it or use it. Maybe you guys can use some of it.’ He took a few things, I cannot remember what, and left. And that was it.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSide note: This is an interesting detail for Sophia to remember. Think back to Sean’s version of events for a minute. Sean told the jury that, after the murder, Sophia gave him a pair of Brad’s pants to change into. Which were submitted as evidence.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: They didn’t fit me. I think the legs were too short. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut here, Sophia is saying that Sean took some of Brad’s clothes from a giveaway bag before he left her house that morning. So could THAT be how Sean ended up with a pair of Brad’s pants? Ok, back to Sophia’s version.\r\n\r\nIt’s now late morning, and Sean and his girlfriend have just left her Sophia’s house. Sophia says she’s blasting 80s love ballads on her living room stereo, and rockin’ out… while rockin’ out.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I was in the nursery in the rocking chair.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe nursery for baby boy Johnson, who’s due in just a few months. She’d just recently finished setting it up with Marlyne, who’s due at her house for lunch pretty soon.\r\n\r\nThe music is so loud, apparently, that Sophia doesn’t hear a knock on her door… sometime after 1 o’clock. But she knows it happened, she says … because the door-\u003cem\u003eknocker\u003c/em\u003e comes back a little later. And it isn’t her mother-in-law… It’s…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: My mother. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia’s mother… whom she hasn’t seen much of since being disfellowshipped from their Kingdom Hall about a year earlier. But her mom is having a problem with her bank account. And Sophia is still listed on her account… so she needs her daughter to go to the bank with her and get it sorted out.\r\n\r\nBut Marlyne is going to be at her house any minute, so Sophia leaves a message on her cell… saying she’ll be back soon, she’s left the door unlocked, Marlyne can just go right in.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: That was the last call I made to her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia and her mom get back from the bank sometime after 2 o’clock, she says. And as they pull onto her street, Sophia notices something immediately.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: There's no car in my driveway and Marlyne's car should be there. So I said to my mom, I don't understand. She's not here cause she was always on time.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia calls Brad. He hasn’t heard anything from his mom. Her father-in-law? Nothing. Someone needs to check on Marlyne.\r\n\r\nIt’s about 3:30 now, and Brad and Sophia are pulling up the long driveway from a dead-end street to her in-laws’ house in Brush Prairie, Washington, about 20 minutes from their own house. It’s an A-frame, made of beautiful dark wood with a big deck. It’s surrounded by evergreens with enviable floor-to-ceiling windows. And through those windows, Sophia sees something… kinda frustrating actually.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: All of the lights are on in the house.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia is like, “Wait a minute, she’s home?!”\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: What in the world, you've been here this whole time, you couldn't answer your phone, you couldn't let me know you're okay. You couldn't just say, I'm not coming, I'm gonna be late. Nothing? You say nothing?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia says her irritation quickly subsides as they get further up the driveway. The garage door is open, but Marlyne’s van… is gone. Brad gets out of their car.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I said, ‘Wait, let's call the police. Where are you going? Something's wrong. Something's wrong.’ He's like, ‘Oh no.’ I was afraid that there was someone in the house and that he could get hurt. I didn't know what we were walking into.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad heads for the door leading from the garage into the basement of the house and tries to open it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: But the door is stuck and he pushes his weight against this door \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne is just on the other side of that door, on the floor. Her son has only gotten a glimpse of the situation.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And he started screaming that his mom was on the ground and she was hurt. I called 9 1 1 immediately. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Sophia says she doesn’t know what’s actually happened.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: She’s lying on the floor and I don’t know what’s wrong. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“She’slying on the floor, and I don’t know what’s wrong,” Sophia tells the dispatcher.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDispatcher: Ok, Take a breath. Deep, deep breath. Ok?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia eventually hands the phone over to Brad, who has now gotten a better look at the body on the basement floor. He knows it’s his mom, despite the fact that she’s virtually unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I throw up. I remember just throwing up. I was sick.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: It was in a state of crying and disbelief and shock and is this real? Did this really happen? Wait, what happened today? And, and I, I felt like we kept checking ourselves to make sure we didn't lose our minds. And that's how the night was spent.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking back to the version of events we heard Sean tell on the stand in the last episode and thinking… WHAT. THE. HELL. I’m right there with you. Sitting in the Johnsons’ house while Sophia looks for money, hearing a scream of some sort, nervously descending the steps to see his sister, standing over Marlyne with a stocking over her face, holding fireplace tongs. Aside from the divorce paperwork and the abandoned coat, the siblings’ stories diverge so drastically it’s like they moved through January 10th in parallel universes. And when they returned to reality, one of them was discounted by detectives. The other, believed. Or at least, believed \u003cem\u003eenough\u003c/em\u003e, according to the lead detective, Rick Buckner.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Was he actually believable? I have no idea. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Because this just feels like such a he-said, she said.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: And that's all we have.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut that wasn’t all they had. The physical evidence in this case was thin. Frustratingly so. But it wasn’t ABSENT. And despite all the things Sophia’s lawyer, Therese, COULDN’T tell the jury about the person accusing her client of murder, she could absolutely tell them this…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: The only physical evidence that you will be presented with in the course of this trial points to Sean Correia.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAfter Sean started cooperating with law enforcement, and telling them his version of January 10, 2002, they made a discovery… that was inconvenient for their leading theory of the case. Marlyne's blood was found on one of Sean's boots.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: The good men and women of the law enforcement team that investigated this case made a mistake and their mistake was is that they fell into the arms and embraced the story of Sean Correia on January 13th before the physical evidence have been analyzed. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEventually, all the evidence would be analyzed, of course. So I asked Detective Buckner…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Was there any physical evidence connecting Sophia to the crime scene, the way that there was the drop of blood on Sean's boot? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Physical evidence? No.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTo this day, 22 years later, the only person physically PROVEN to be at the scene of Marlyne’s murder… is Sean.

And an aroma coming from a room to the left.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I smell some incense, maybe? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Uh, I made, uh, pumpkin spice muffins this morning. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Oh, that could be it.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis hugging, muffin-maker is Lyn Page. And the room to the left... is basically the EVERYTHING room. There's a music space with a synthesizer from the 70s, an office zone with a desk and a computer, an art-making area with a table and various fabrics and fibers.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: And there's always a work in progress, so it's always a mess. Now let me show you this. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLyn walks me over a couple steps to a particularly impressive work in progress.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Oh my gosh. This is a huge macrame. What is that? Two feet? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Yeah, it's 23 inches. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: 23 inches, plus extra string. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: And I'm not done with it cause I'm putting fringe on it now. The tree is done. This is what I'm making for Dick and Jean for Christmas.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDick and Jean — a couple Lyn is friends with. Dick... is short for Richard. Johnson. The widower of Marlyne Johnson. Lyn has known Richard since junior high... and she's only become better friends with him since then. 23-inch handmade macrame kind of friends. But Lyn was also a confidante of Marlyne's when she was alive. And her closeness with both of the Johnsons offers a window into a marriage and a family that not many who know about Marlyne's murder have even gotten to peer into before.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: We didn't know whether or not they were gonna separate. And that's where that $10,000 stash comes in. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI'm Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair.\r\n\r\nChapter four: The Husband.\r\n\r\n10 months before stepping foot in Lyn’s museum of an apartment, she left me a voicemail.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Hi there. My name is Lyn Page and I understand that you've been in conversation with Brad and Richard Johnson recently. And they suggested that I give you a call.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe irony of Richard leading me to Lyn, is that… later in this episode… \u003cem\u003eLyn \u003c/em\u003ewill lead me BACK to Richard Johnson… who you WILL get to hear from. But when I first reached out to him, he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk to me. In fact, I'd say he was pretty sure he DIDN'T want to. Or at least, didn’t want to be \u003cem\u003erecorded\u003c/em\u003e. But Richard told me about a couple people who \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e want to talk to me. Friends of the family. One of whom attended every single day of Sophia's trial in 2003 and had taken detailed notes.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: You can return my call if you're interested in talking about this, uh, the A-frame murder, which is the name of my book. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nA book? The A-Frame Murder? HELL YES I was interested in talking to Lyn.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: And frankly, I think you should read it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHELL YES I wanted to read it. Lyn emailed me a PDF of her unpublished opus, “The A-Frame Murder.” It's fiction, technically. Lyn changed all the names. Marlyne is Maureen. Sophia is Sonia. Sean is, wait for it... Shane, confusingly enough. Which I'm sure ACTUAL Shane will cringe at hearing. Lyn added some other embellishments and signature flourishes. “Like a gust of cold air through a warm room, his extended sigh blew across our silent attention.” But the details of the trial itself are based off of pages and pages of shorthand transcriptions of witness testimony and notes. Pages that Lyn had typed up and filed away. Until 2020. When it occurred to her... that Sophia and Brad's son — the one Sophia had given birth to in jail — had just turned 18. The time felt right to finally do something with those notes.\r\n\r\nSo she wrote the book. I read all 239 pages of it, and hopped back on the phone with Lyn about a month later.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Why did you decide to attend the trial? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Well, because Marlyne was my friend, and because I was the only one who was gonna do it, who would be able to attend every single day.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLyn was a self-employed massage therapist at the time. She gave Richard massages at his house every other week.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: I'm kinda like his sister that he never had, who calls it like it is and tells him what he needs to hear. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWith Marlyne, Lyn had more of a spiritual sisterhood.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: My time with her was mostly in the teepee and we'd just chat about, you know, any old thing going on.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe teepee. Lyn says she has Cherokee ancestry, and she's had several teepees over the years, including a 22-foot tall one that Marlyne and Richard let her set up on their property. You've heard of a man cave... Well THIS... was a lady lodge. Where Lyn says she and Marlyne drummed and chanted, and where Marlyne would open up about problems in her marriage to Richard.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: As a couple, he was, in those days, he was different than he is now.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLyn says the Johnsons were on the verge of divorce more than once. At a certain point, Marlyne started putting money aside.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: She had done what we friends of hers counseled her to do in case there was a breakup of the marriage. She needed to be able to take care of herself. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLyn was pretty open about the \u003cem\u003eexistence\u003c/em\u003e of tension in Marlyne and Richard’s marriage generally. But when it came to Richard and the \u003cem\u003esource\u003c/em\u003e of the tension…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: I would, uh, she worried about his drinking and his gambling. Now more than that. I, you know, it's hard for me to say much about that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard’s drinking and gambling. There was clearly more to the story here, and I was hesitant to press further during this first phone call. But, as I told Lyn, I had another call to make. To someone named Lin-DA... whom Richard had also suggested I talk to.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: She is a talker, so if you get her on the phone, she'll dump everything. Oh God, I love her. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd I... love a talker.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Mostly what I remember about her were the birds. She loved the birds so much. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Linda Dillard, who says Marlyne spoiled the birds both outside her house AND inside. She had one particularly memorable pet bird.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Bee-dee-pee. That's what the bird said all the time. Bee-dee-pee. She loved that bird. And that bird would rip your nose off, but not hers.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLinda was the Johnsons’ house cleaner. She’d come every other week, and Marlyne was usually home at the time.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: I was there four or five hours, and we talked about everything you can imagine. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI could imagine a fair bit after talking to Lyn, but I was hoping to hear more about Marlyne and Richard's marriage. Linda also knew about the money Marlyne had set aside.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: That was in case things got weird and she wanted to leave.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Does that have to do with Richard's gambling and drinking problem?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Yeah. I also was in a battered relationship for several years…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I'm so sorry to hear that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Well, I got out. I got out. But, we used to talk about that kind of stuff. Because we had things in common like that, and we could just tell each other anything. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: When you say you had things in common, was Marlyne being abused? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Oh, God. I, physically, I don't believe so, but they would have some pretty rough arguments. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Marlyne and Richard?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Yeah.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis all had an eerie feeling to it… Big arguments. A marriage on the rocks. A stash of money set aside by a woman who ends up getting killed in her own home with no obvious sign of a break-in. Linda’s felt this, too.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: When it all came down, you know, people always think the husband did it. And that thought came across my mind a few times just because you're wondering and wondering.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt seemed like Linda and Lyn might be holding back. I didn't blame them. I was a stranger on the phone on therr other side of the country. Until…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: What's in the hummus? This is great. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: It really is. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI wasn’t … and Linda, Lyn and I were eating salad and bean dip together, knee-to-knee around a small table in the “everything room” in Lyn's apartment\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: I went easy on the garlic because I didn't want you to have to worry about breathing on people…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe waited to dig into the topic at hand until after we'd dug in to lunch. And then, we started... just talking about their friend, Marlyne. Their very \u003cem\u003egenerous\u003c/em\u003e friend.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: The chair you're sitting in came from her. That credenza with all my cookbooks in it came from her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSome of the handwoven rugs I'd unceremoniously stepped on coming into Lyn's place, those came from Marlyne, too. And Linda has a big yellow bread bowl in her house that used to be hers.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: And I used to tease her all the time about it. I’d say, when you die, I get that bowl \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: And she gave it to you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: Well, Dick ended up giving it to me. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nA smaller, but maybe more poignant gesture, are the feathers Marlyne would give each of them, left behind by skybound visitors to her yard.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Just good. She was good, and crappy things kept happening to her. And then ultimately the worst thing happened to her. And you, when you, if you knew her, you just can't imagine that anybody could do that to her. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: When you said bad things kept happening to Marlyne, Linda, what were you referring to? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: Just stuff in life that, just, just the regular, are you having a good day or are you having a bad day? Those kind of little things. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Except Dick's drinking and gambling. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: I wasn't gonna, I wasn't gonna go there. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: But I already, I've already breached that dam. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: I wasn't gonna go there.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut THERE we were… breaching that dam together.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dillard: It caused her great anguish. I told her many times. You just get rid of him. No, she stood by her man. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: But she did listen to those of us who were encouraging her to get her own credit cards. Bank account. Establish herself. That was what she was supposed to be saving for her possible exit from that marriage.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne’s separate bank account had come up in one of my unrecorded phone calls with Richard. He’d told me that Marlyne was just saving up for a new heat pump for their house.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Was that the agreed upon narrative? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: I don't know that story.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Dick did not know about her bank account that was hers. And whatever she told him, if he found out was—\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBullshit... Lyn's expression suggested. And there are secrets that Linda has kept well beyond Marlyne's grave, and will likely take to her own.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: See, even now, I wouldn't talk about it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, Linda and Lyn have nothing nice to say about Sophia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: She played the whole damn family.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThey told me she came across as bratty and materialistic. That they heard stories from Marlyne about Sophia getting caught in lies, being unkind to animals, and having a temper.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: She was just a bitch.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut these friends also want to know what Sophia has told me. About her backstory. About Marlyne. And about the murder.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: What she said to me is, as long as they think I've done this, then they're not looking for who actually did this. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Which is very true. And that's what makes it a cold case. It's listed in Vancouver as a cold case.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliar: Is it? Shit. If somebody got away with this horrendous thing, they're very clever, whoever that might be. So you are gonna have to be really good at trying to figure out who's telling the truth and who's not telling the truth. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWould Richard Johnson tell me the truth, starting with his relationship with Marlyne, as Lyn and Linda remember it? I was about to find out.\r\n\r\nMore in a minute.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Hi Jean. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJean: Hi, Amory. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: See, she got your name right? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLyn and I have pulled up to a therapist's office on a residential street in Vancouver, not far from her house. Jean, Richard Johnson's girlfriend, is outside waiting for us. This is where Jean and Richard suggested we meet. Which makes sense. I don't expect everyone to invite me into their museum of a home and feed me garlicky bean dip. Certainly not when I'm about to ask them uncomfortable things. Therapists' offices were built for such conversations.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I'm Amory. I'm sorry for the cold.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI offer Richard a cold hand, but he greets me warmly in his reserved, soft-spoken way. He's narrower than the Richard I saw in trial footage from 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: State your name and spell your last name for the record, please. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: My name is Richard Johnson. J-o-h-n-s-o-n \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard’s in his late 70s when I make this visit. He slurs his words a bit, he warns me.\r\n\r\nSlurred words were the least of my concerns. I was predicting this interview to be... unpredictable. Lyn had told me that Richard can go on and on about his wife being murdered, but also that he wants this to all go away. The vibe in the room feels a little like an intervention. Like Richard probbbably doesn't want to be there and is only talking to me as a favor to Lyn or Jean or both. But I'd waited a full year for Richard to feel ready to go on the record with me. I'd flown across the country. It’s now or never to talk to him about Marlyne.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Siverson: How did you meet her?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I met her over at Jimmy's house one time. It was, Jim’s a friend, and I said, man, that's a good looking woman. And then I saw her another time and…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: She had the most wonderful dimples. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Siverson: Oh yeah, yeah, I can see that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s Lyn chiming in, helping Richard along. I had asked him to bring any photos of Marlyne that he might want me to see. He brought 4 or 5 of her old drivers' licenses. An interesting choice... but Marlyne... didn't take a license photo the way most people -- or at least the way I -- take a license photo. She looks casually perfect in all of them. Cheery, youthful. Fair skin with black curly hair that's in pigtails in one of the photos. Matching dark eyes, and the sweetest smile. As if she had been genuinely happy to be at the DMV. And yep, the most wonderful dimples.\r\n\r\nThe second time Richard saw Marlyne was on Christmas day, again at his friend Jim's house. They were in their early 20s at the time.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Marlyne showed up with Brad, a one-year-old baby. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard Johnson might be dad to Brad, but he's not his \u003cem\u003ebiological\u003c/em\u003e father.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: She was estranged from her husband. He was a bum. You know, he was in the Navy and he was screwing around and which that seems to be common for Navy guys. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe third time he ran into Marlyne, she did not have a 1-year in her arms.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I was out at the Longhorn prowling for a, you know, it was a tavern.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMarlyne was there with a friend, whom Richard also knew.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: And I'm pretty shy person if I'm, you know, I don't just talk very easily to people I don't know, but I knew them. And so I sat down and talked and we proceeded to talk until they closed the place and then we had Chinese dinner at four in the morning. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: That's how all the best memories are made. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Yeah. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI thumbed through Marlyne's driver's licenses again, looking at them through a slightly different lens now. A young mother who'd already been through a broken heart and marriage, finding new love and a new iteration of family. I studied her eyes from picture to picture, looking for signs of hope or pain or premonition. A stretch, I know. And certainly not something I was going to say out loud. But it's hard to look at a photo of a person who doesn't know they're going to die an unimaginably brutal death and not want to whisper some warning into their two-dimensional ear. What came out of my mouth in the moment was...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: She has really kind eyes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: She's beautiful. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Siverston: Yeah, absolutely. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: And she aged really well. At least up until 58 years old. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard walked me through the day of Marlyne's murder and the immediate aftermath.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I was at the office at, uh, midday or so, and then I, um, at that point in my life, sometimes I took a long lunch and went up to La Center and gambled. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLa Center, Washington, about 20 minutes from Vancouver, where there's a cluster of casinos. I wasn't expecting Richard to be the first to bring up his gambling. I was glad he did... although I ALSO wasn't expecting him to talk about it in the present tense.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Everybody's wondering why I don't just throw all my money away gambling, but actually I have luck occasionally, more than occasionally. Sometimes I win 4 or $5,000 in one hand. So it's part of my life and I keep it under control. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI had heard that Richard had gone to the casino the day Marlyne died. He may have been mid-card-game when the attack was happening, in fact. Detective Rick Buckner had surveillance footage.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I believe we had Richard at one of the casinos gambling. But again, was it his twin brother? We don't know. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nPAUSE. Richard has a twin brother. Identical. Who also lived in the area. And who also gambles. So was the person they saw on the casino's surveillance footage at the time of the murder... RICHARD Johnson? Or was it the nearly indistinguishable DAVID Johnson?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I mean, there was little things in the, in the investigation that we could never really pin down. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard says he went to the casino for an hour or two around lunchtime that day, and then back to his office. And then, in the late afternoon....\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: All of a sudden a phone call came in and my secretary starts going nuts and just says, you gotta go home. And so I drove home, and as I got near the house before I rounded the bend where you could see the house, I just, I just started crying. I knew something was bad, you know, I just knew it was… and sure enough. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThere were a few moments like this during my conversation with Richard. Where the emotion overflowed so suddenly it was almost startling. He told me he suffers from PTSD.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: It was shock. You know, I mean, you come up there and the sheriff's there and they got a chaplain to talk to you and you can't even step foot on the property. All they wanted to do was find out if I was involved in it. For a couple weeks, that's where they were at. And, you know, that's about as frustrating as you can, you know, imagine because they're wasting their energy, instead of finding the person that might have killed my wife, they're looking at me. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: We were looking at everybody at that point. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I mean, the police are pretty hard. There's not a lot of compassion there.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut… as Linda said earlier… people often do suspect the husband when a spouse is murdered. Especially if there’s a history of problems in the marriage… which Richard was also open with me about. And about, supposedly, trying to fix them.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Probably the most significant counseling that I had was for alcohol abuse. The first, you know, and I voluntarily did that and was sober for five years, otherwise I would've lost my marriage.I was having some issues with alcohol and stress. Lawyering is a stressful job.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRichard's a real estate attorney. WAS a real estate attorney. He stopped practicing law -- or even really BELIEVING in it as a result of how he feels the legal system has FAILED him time and again… Beginning with failing Marlyne. Richard refutes the idea that her murder is a cold case.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: No, it's a botched case. That's all it is. I was so full of anger that I knew I was unfit to practice law, and so I just surrendered my license.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Siverston: You stepped away from law because you lost a sort of faith?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I have nothing but contempt for the law, at this time in my life, nothing but contempt for the law and the people that earn their living off of it. And then of course they put me up on the stand and have me testify. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: And sir, when you were gambling on Tuesday, January 8th, isn't it true that you drank some black Russians at the New Phoenix? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: If that's what I told the detectives, that's what I told them. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: So is that the truth? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I told the detectives the truth. I have no reason to lie. You know, their lawyer was very effective at goading me, and I'm sure my temper came out, which has been exploited more than once. Didn't you know I was convicted of domestic violence for raising my voice? And so if they had any evidence at all that I was involved, that my temper would've, uh, led 'em to that. But obviously I wasn't, I was out playing cards in La Center at the time, and I had no motive, you know, but I have a temper. We don't need to get into that sad chapter of, uh, alleged domestic violence, which that law is so flawed. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Don't go there, dick. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: All right. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJean: You're on the record here.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: It's over and done with now, finally. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI'm not going to go there either in this series... other than to acknowledge that Richard did have a domestic violence-related charge brought against him 6 years ago. It was in the relationship he was in before Jean.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another relationship Richard spoke openly about. The one with his son, Brad. Which has been complicated, at times. Richard raised Brad. They love each other, but I couldn't help but detect some degree of bitterness... maybe even distrust. Because... Brad brought Sophia into the Johnson family.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: And, as far as I'm concerned, she is the person who committed, who murdered my wife, and nobody's ever gonna convince me otherwise. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, I don't think Richard blames Brad for Marlyne's murder. But he does hold him accountable for things he didn't tell him and Marlyne about Sophia. Like the fact that she had been married once already. To be fair, Brad had too. So had Marlyne! But it was the deception that Richard told me he's still angry about today.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: Not only her lying, but convincing Brad to lie. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAfter Marlyne's murder, Richard had an interesting conversation with a legal partner of his. This guy told Richard… that he’d run into Brad and Sophia at the courthouse about a month before they got married.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: And he says, what are you doing here? And then, well, Sophia's here to get her divorce finalized. “Well, don't tell dad!” That's the kinda lie I'm talking about. I didn't talk to Brad for about two years.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI get why Richard would be unsettled by the secret-keeping here. But I also don't think that's something you cut contact off with your son for years over unless there's a deeper, unspoken sense of betrayal simmering below. Or maybe the therapist's office was having an effect on me.\r\n\r\nI had this conversation with Richard Johnson in December of 2022. Almost exactly a year later, he died… suddenly… days before his 80th birthday. He’ll never hear this, but it’s still important to me to say… I don't think Richard Johnson killed Marlyne. He may have had a temper, he had a history of addiction, and as much as he laid into Brad and Sophia for lies they told, it's quite possible he lied to Marlyne at times about his gambling and alcohol use during their marriage. I don't know. I do know... that I had the sense talking to Richard that I was in the presence of a man who's was as scarred as he was flawed. Who lost his wife of 32 years in the most nightmarish way and was never the same.\r\n\r\nI also think… there’s a chance Richard was wrong about Sophia being the person who murdered Marlyne. Linda and Lyn at least seem open to another explanation.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBecause I still don't know for sure. None of us know for sure.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd as such, they left me with words of warning.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eBe careful. You're digging in a place that's been very peaceful for a while, and if Sophia didn't do it, then you might dig up something that nobody wants you to dig up. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLyn Page: Do it, anyway. Do it, anyway. Dig.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: And then I wanna know.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMoments after Linda left Lyn’s apartment that day, she came hurrying back in with something in her hand: a large brown and white feather that she’d found on the hood of her car. “Marlyne was here,” she said. A sign, Linda thought, that she’d been watching over our conversation. A sign of approval? I wish I knew.\r\n\r\nBut I have kept digging. And the next spot to tell you about… is one where most people didn't think to look.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Siverston: Hey Brad, how's it going? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Oh, not bad. Another peachy day. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Another peachy day?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: If anything were to happen to Richard or to Marlyne, who inherits it? Brad Johnson. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNext time, the motive. And the secret that Sophia and Brad may have been keeping TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Who's married to Brad? Sophia Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: So the embezzlement started in… what year did I marry Brad? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRichard Johnson: I don't remember talking to Brad much about it, saying, you know, it's your problem. I don't know a thing about it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: There's no erasing him from those pictures depositing the checks. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBeyond All Repair is a production of WBUR, Boston’s NPR, and ZSP Media.\r\n\r\nIt’s written and reported by me, Amory Sivertson, and produced by Sofie Kodner.\r\n\r\nMix, sound design and original scoring by Paul Vaitkus, production manager of WBUR Podcasts.\r\n\r\nTheme and credits music by me.\r\n\r\nOur managing producers are Samata Joshi for WBUR and Liz Stiles of ZSP Media.

Is it some kind of a robbery gone bad? Is it a burglary in the house? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinda Dilliard: And that's where that $10,000 stash comes in.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKelli Osler: What we are asking the court to consider this evidence for is motive in the hom– homicide.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt’s February of 2003 — one year after Marlyne’s murder, and roughly one month BEFORE the trial of her alleged murderer would begin.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Your Honor, I'd like to address the very last thing that Ms. Osler said to start my argument…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe’re hearing… a hearing. Another one of those pre-trial hearings, where the prosecution and defense are legally duking it out over what evidence should and should not be allowed to be presented to the jury. Sophia’s defense attorney, Therese Lavallee, has a few things she definitely wants to keep OUT.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: I wanna keep this jury focused on the murder. This whole trial is about the murder. It is not about Sophia Johnson's past bad acts. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBad. Acts. Remember that metaphor for Sophia’s life — all those boxes that need to be unpacked? We’ve got a big one in this episode…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: if you allow the state to parade in what they want to do, it's going to change the whole focus of the jury from the murder. Onto her bad acts. They're gonna be trying a case within a case, and it's mud-slinging.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese is arguing that Sophia’s “bad acts” or previous misdeeds are unrelated to the murder. It would be wrong to equate them. But if the jury knows about these bad acts, they won’t be able to UN-know about them, and it’ll color their perspective of Sophia in a way that’ll make her trial… less fair. The prosecution sees it differently.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKelli Osler: The defense is arguing that this is very prejudicial and that we are attempting to heap on a mini fraud trial on the defendant in the middle of her murder trial. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is the \u003cem\u003edeputy\u003c/em\u003e prosecuting attorney for the case, Kelli Osler. And what the defense is calling mud-slinging, Osler might call… a connecting of the dots.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKelli Osler:  The jury should be allowed to hear the amount of the debt in order to get a full picture of exactly how desperate she was and how willing she was to kill in order to get that money she was looking for.  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n“In order to get that money she was looking for.” Money, the prosecution says, is why Sophia killed Marlyne Johnson. In the months and years leading up to the murder, Sophia was in undeniably serious financial trouble.\r\n\r\nAt least some of which was caused by bad — and maybe \u003cem\u003edesperate\u003c/em\u003e — acts.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: There are a hundred different choices I could have made differently. I wish I had made better choices. I wish I can go back to my young self and say, please put it back. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut was Sophia desperate enough to commit murder?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Don't do it. It's not worth it. The far-reaching consequences will not be worth this now\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI'm Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair.\r\n\r\nChapter Five: The Motive.\r\n\r\nWe’re gonna unpack the “Bad Acts” box TOGETHER… and try to understand how Sophia ended up in a desperate enough state of debt that some people believe she may have killed to get out of it.\r\n\r\nI wanna start in the Fall of 2000. Sophia had been in Vancouver, Washington for a couple years at this point. She was married to a fellow Jehovah’s Witness — and she had a job as the office manager for a telecommunications company, County Communications. She liked talking to the people who came into the store. One person in particular…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Brad came in one day and I commented to my boss, the owner, I said, gosh, he is such an attractive man. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad Johnson. With his brown eyes, almost-fluffy hair, square chin and cool confidence.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: He seemed very playful and very funny, and I really liked that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia’s boss happened to be good friends with Brad. But he was also a Jehovah’s Witness and knew she was married. So Sophia and Brad struck up an over-the-counter, under-the-radar flirtation. And then, one afternoon, he called her.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Brad said, um, I was just wondering, I'm going out tonight with some friends, I wanted to know if you'd like to join me. And I jokingly said, you know, you're one of my favorite people, but I'm still gonna have to say no. And he said, why, do you have to wash your hair ? And I started laughing . I'm like, yep, that's it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia was like, “Haven’t you seen my wedding ring?”\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: He said, yeah, but sometimes girls wear that just to keep creeps away. And I said, yeah, not in this case. I said, so it's not really a rain check, it's, I can't do this. And then I called him two days later to say, I can't stop thinking about you. How about that date? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat first date was in September of 2000. The timing will become important. But for now, the still-married Sophia is swoonin’ for Brad.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I felt so giddy by the fact that this guy was interested in me, that this guy who I thought was so hot, was interested in me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nJust a few months later, Brad invited Sophia to spend Christmas with him and his parents, Marlyne and Richard Johnson. This was Sophia’s first time meeting them.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And they have a really nice house and it's on a good piece of property and it's an A-frame house that has glass all around it. It's all windows on that main level. And it's really beautiful. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow how’d Sophia get away with celebrating arguably the biggest holiday with another man’s family? Well, Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t celebrate holidays… or birthdays. So a holiday celebrating Jesus’ birthday? No THANK you!\r\n\r\nStill, it was complicated…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And the dad opens the door, super nice, I'm thinking to myself, God, are my wedding rings in my pocket or is like, do I have them on? I felt like a creep. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSo who \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e this guy that Sophia was willing to feel like a creep to be with?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003e Amory Sivertson: Hey Brad, how's it going? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Oh, not bad. Another peachy day. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Another peachy day? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Yep.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad, like his dad, didn’t want to go on the record when I first reached out to him. But a full year and a half later, he finally agreed.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Uhhhh… yeah. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad and I talked for more than THREE HOURS that night. I’ll share some of what I’ve learned — both from him, and from the case file.\r\n\r\nBrad was 33 when he met Sophia, and 12 years her senior.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I loved Sophia. I admit it. I, I, I found her very attractive. And, you know, I was fat and happy at that time. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAh, the fat-and-happy early days of a relationship. Indulging in each other. But also, just getting to know one another. Sophia learned that Brad was divorced. And that he also worked for a telecommunications company — a competitor of the one she worked for, the one his good friend owned… and they sold a lot of the same equipment: flip phones, palm pilots. You know, early 2000s stuff. But sometime before that, Brad worked for the FBI.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: We did some bugging and wiretapping. I have relationships with all of the sheriff's departments and I did camera work, alarm systems. I did telephones, I did their 911 dispatch consoles. So a lot of places will have me put up covert cameras, you know, like a camera that looks like a pencil sharpener, or a camera that looks like a clock. And then you can't see the camera unless you know what you're looking for.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSometimes, you can’t see the thing that’s right in front of you, unless you know what you’re looking for. There’s a lot Brad says he didn’t see about Sophia. But there also might be something that no one saw about BOTH of them.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: The embezzlement started in, and I hate to ask you this, what year did I marry Brad? Was it 2001? It was, right?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nRIGHT. Sophia and Brad got married in September of 2001 – almost a year to the day from their first date. But the embezzlement Sophia is referencing started just a couple months after that first date. And it started with a bad act against HER, Sophia says.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: So I worked in the office, like I told you at County Communications. I did their office manager work, but then I started moving mostly into sales because I really liked it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSales was where the money was. The commission on a single cell phone was more than 5 times Sophia’s hourly office manager rate, she says. And one day, she sold one of those cell phones to a guy who was opening a branch of his business in the area and would need a lot more phones and two-way radios and the like. Oh, we got you, Sophia told him. County Communications can get you all set up! Cha-CHING. The sale was made, Sophia’s boss did all the paperwork, and she… was looking forward to a hefty commission payout.\r\n\r\nBut when Sophia went to log the sale in the company’s computer system the next day, she didn’t see her name credited on the paperwork…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: All of it showed Jim as the person collecting all of the commission.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nJim O’Donohue. Her boss.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I thought, what the hell? Bullshit. No way. You never would've gotten this guy without me. He came in here, he came to our store because I told him about you. There's no way. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAccording to Sophia, Jim was basically like, “I made the sale.” And she was like, buuuuut the sale never would have HAPPENED without me!\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: He refused to give me the commission on that. He disagreed entirely. And we're talking thousands of dollars. So I started taking money. And I know this is wrong. I make no excuses for it. But instead of pursuing this fight with Jim, I started stealing money from the company that would equal that money from the commissions\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAt first, Sophia says she was pocketing cash from customer sales rather than putting it in the register. But she didn’t stop with the money she missed out on from that one deal.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I went on a rampage. I felt wronged, I felt cheated, and it felt slimy. And of course I went ahead and in turn did the exact same thing. I was wrong. I cheated him and I became slimy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWeeks went by, and no one seemed to notice the missing money... so Sophia kept going. She started writing checks, and forging the co-owner of County Communications’ signature.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Like I was out of control. I made a bad situation a hundred times worse. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt would be \u003cem\u003eNINE MONTHS\u003c/em\u003e before her boss, Jim, realized what was going on. He confronted Sophia, but he also spoke to his good friend, Brad, who was now Sophia’s \u003cem\u003efiance\u003c/em\u003e.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: We sat down in the middle of this driveway and we were talking for probably a good hour, and basically he says, I believe Sophia is stealing from me. I don't think you should marry her. And he was very plain, and at that point I had gotten Sophia pregnant. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad was supposed to marry Sophia — the now-mother of his unborn child — a \u003cem\u003emonth\u003c/em\u003e from when this conversation with Jim happened. He didn’t \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to believe what his friend was telling him, but also Jim didn’t make it easy to believe him, Brad says.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Do you remember what amount he told you at the time?  \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I think it's an obscene amount, for the size of his business, I think it's an obscene amount. $400,000. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n$400,000… is a LOT of money for Sophia to have potentially stolen from County Communications. But investigators weren’t able to PROVE that much had been taken… or even close to it. \u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\nIn the end, the amount of money that was documented to have been stolen by Sophia? $71,283. And 82 cents.\r\n\r\nBy the time Marlyne Johnson was murdered in January of 2002, about six months after Sophia’s boss confronted her, the embezzlement investigation was still ongoing.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: We had gotten information from the Washougal Police Department that they were doing an investigation into County Communications in which Sophia had embezzled a large amount of money. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDetective Rick Buckner didn’t know about the embezzlement when he was first questioning Sophia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: And they did call and say, you know, just FYI, Sophia Johnson's a suspect in one of our cases too. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis… was intriguing intel, considering Rick was investigating the murder of Sophia’s mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: We're looking at, you know, who would've, you know, benefited from this? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHe was asking himself that simple question that lacked a simple answer: WHY would anyone kill Marlyne?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: The only evidence that we had was that Sophia Johnson had mentioned to somebody that she was looking for a stash of money that her mother Marlyne had\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat SOMEBODY, of course, was Sophia’s brother… Sean.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: She said that Marlyne had $10,000 stashed in some, uh, place in her house.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Sean, do you recall Sophia ever discussing in your presence what would happen if Marlyne and Richard Johnson died? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSea Correia: Uh, yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: What did she say in that regard? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: That her and Brad would get a house.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe detectives knew from early interviews with Sean that Marlyne may have had money in the house. But now, with knowledge of a separate investigation into Sophia for stealing someone else’s money, and  a LOT of it, Sean’s story… was starting to sound more believable. Motive-worthy, maybe.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: She was looking for money. That was her big motivation right there. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut let’s think this through.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the murder, Sophia knows she’s in serious financial trouble. Her former boss has gone to the police about the embezzlement. It’s unclear what the full consequences of that will be. Meanwhile, there miiiiight be a stash of cash at her mother-in-law’s house. Maybe $10,000, as Sean said? Well that’s a fraction of what Sophia owed her employer. Hardly an amount to kill someone over… though NO amount is, obviously. So… say it’s a robbery-gone-wrong. If, as Sean said, he and Sophia were in the house when Marlyne came home, couldn’t they have just snuck out another door when they heard the garage opening? Or heck, even just stayed \u003cem\u003eput\u003c/em\u003e. Sophia went over to Marlyne’s house all the time. She and Brad had a key to their house! Even if she had rounded a corner of the house and run smack dab into Marlyne, couldn’t she have just said, “Oh my god, I’m so sorry. My brother just really needed the money from the coat I left here, but we couldn’t find it, so we were JUST on our way out!”...?\r\n\r\nOr, let’s say Sophia was after an \u003cem\u003einheritance\u003c/em\u003e, as Detective Buckner posited to me in a follow-up phone call.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: If anything were to happen to Richard or to Marlyne, who inherits it? Brad Johnson. Who's married to Brad? Sophia Johnson.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMaybe, like Sean said on the stand, Sophia wanted a house from her in-laws.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And they have a really nice house and it's on a good piece of property…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nOr maybe she was hoping for some life insurance money? Which she would only get through her marriage to Brad… but heck, if Sophia owes her boss tens of thousands of dollars… couldn’t Brad, her husband, have been feeling the weight of that too? And on THAT note… is it really possible that Brad didn’t know Sophia was bringing home thousands of dollars of stolen money at the time?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Did Sophia ever, you know, admit to you that she had taken money from County Communications in any amount? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Nope. Never admitted it.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: He knew that I was taking money. He knew cuz he was cashing it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMore… in a minute.\r\n\r\nIt’s January 14, 2002 — four days after Brad Johnson’s mother was found bludgeoned to death, and \u003cem\u003ehours\u003c/em\u003e after his wife was arrested for her murder. The detectives on the case are fleshing out their money-themed motive after learning about tens of thousands of dollars Sophia had stolen from her employer the year before, mostly by forging checks. But there’s an eyebrow-raising detail: Some of those stolen checks… were made out to BRAD JOHNSON. About a dozen of them, according to Brad \u003cem\u003ehimself\u003c/em\u003e… who told detectives they ranged from several hundred to several thousand dollars each.\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: When he took the first check, he never asked why this check was made out to him. And when the second check and the third check came, there was no question. It was, okay, I'll put this in the bank. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad may have never asked why his name was on the checks, according to Sophia. But the detectives sure did. His response? He… didn’t… know.\r\n\r\n“It’s goofy the way that the money is getting to your account,” one of the detectives said.\r\n\r\nBut goofy enough to make him a suspect in his own mother’s murder investigation?\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDetective Buckner again.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Do you feel like Brad told you the whole story? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: No. Nobody ever tells me the whole story. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad wasn’t a suspect for long. Because… while Buckner may have never gotten the whole story from him, Brad didn’t factor AT ALL into the story he DID have for the day of the murder. The one Sean told him… which focused solely on Sophia. So the inconclusiveness around Brad’s involvement in the embezzlement? You can file that under that casually haunting statement we heard from Buckner in the last episode…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: I mean, there was little things in the investigation that we could never really pin down. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003eI’m \u003c/em\u003enot sure I got the full story from Brad either, if this response regarding Sophia’s County Communications checks is any indication.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I'm going to plead dumbness because I don't remember her, I don't remember her ever bringing home a paycheck and I don't remember her ever not bringing home a paycheck.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nOr maybe Brad really \u003cem\u003edidn’t\u003c/em\u003e see the thing that was right in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I was in the middle of the storm and I didn't pick up on it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Isn't his name on these accounts too?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane, Sophia’s youngest brother… the lawyer… he doesn’t buy it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: He's just saying, hey officer, I know all of these specifics. I didn't stop it and it was her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAfter reading through the case file and wrapping his head around the timelines for both Sophia and Brad’s relationship AND the embezzlement, a couple things stand out to Shane.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShe doesn't start embezzling until after she meets Brad. The fact that he still marries her after like it's comes out that she's, uh, embezzling. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is true, as far as we know. Sophia and Brad start dating in September of 2000. The embezzlement isn’t documented to have started until November of that year. Maybe Brad put Sophia up to it? He did know the business… and Sophia’s boss… REALLY well.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there’s this: months after Sophia supposedly stopped stealing from County Communications, she continued to write large checks. BAD checks, in fact, between various bank accounts of hers and Brad’s. Including one for $20,000. Brad claimed not to know about this, BUT…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: There's no erasing him from those pictures, depositing the checks.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIn the case file are bank surveillance photos… of Brad in his car at a drive-up ATM… And there’s a letter from a bank teller confirming that they have a check for $20,000 AND video footage of Brad and Sophia. The teller also wrote that Brad, quote, “seemed suspicious,” and says the bank took down his license plate number and a description of his car. What Shane sees in all of this… is a lack of accountability when it comes to Brad.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: And you, the five foot, four, six month pregnant woman. Two people who are committing this financial crime. You're the one we're gonna take down for this brutal murder.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLet’s go back to that \u003cem\u003epre\u003c/em\u003e-trial hearing we were… hearing… earlier. The one in which Sophia’s lawyer said THIS about including Sophia’s bad-act-induced-debt in her murder trial…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: It’s mud-slinging!\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd the deputy prosecuting attorney argued, “No, no, it’s CONTEXT”...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKelli Osler: The jury should be allowed to hear the amount of the debt.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWell the \u003cem\u003ejudge\u003c/em\u003e said…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: I think that a pattern of living beyond your financial means is a pattern that is part of, probably part of the motive in this case. As the desperation increases, then so do the desperate acts.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd so, come the start of the \u003cem\u003eactual\u003c/em\u003e trial, the State of Washington vs. Sophia Johnson, the\u003cem\u003e lead\u003c/em\u003e prosecutor Tom Duffy…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the jury…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nHe was able to survey up a BUFFET of financial issues Sophia was staring down at the time of the murder… that, collectively, he claimed… explained \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e she killed Marlyne.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: The motive for this act was greed. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, \u003cem\u003edesperate\u003c/em\u003e acts, as the judge said, and \u003cem\u003egreedy\u003c/em\u003e ones… are NOT the same thing. And it might not be one or the other in this case. But if \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e were a prosecutor trying to convince a jury that someone was wicked enough to commit murder, I know which narrative \u003cem\u003eI’m\u003c/em\u003e going with.\r\n\r\nOne of these greedy acts, Duffy said, involved two of the most significant people in Sophia’s life.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: State would call Michael Schoepflin. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMichael Schoepflin is Sophia’s first husband, the Jehovah’s Witness she had moved across the country with, and then divorced a few years later. On the day of Marlyne’s murder, Michael gave Sophia a call around 8am.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: And what was the purpose of your contact with Sophia that morning?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Schoepflin: I had some problems with some bills and I needed to get, um, a certain bank situation corrected as soon as possible.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe audio is… NOT terrific. VHS tapes, man. But stick with him. Because what Michael would go on to say… is that his ex-wife Sophia’s name… was still on his bank account. And for a reason unknown to him, the account had been suddenly overdrawn.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: And when you spoke to Sophia that morning, what did she indicate was her intention?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Schoepflin: I talked to her for just a few seconds and then she said that she would, she assured me that she would call me right back. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did she call you back? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Schoepflin: No, sir.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMichael wasn’t the only one trying to get a hold of Sophia that day. Enter VIP number two: Sophia’s mother Grace, who said she had stopped by her house around 1 o’clock. MINUTES after Marlyne is believed to have been killed. Sophia’s lawyer asked Grace about this visit when she was on the stand.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: What did you do when you got to your daughter's house? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eGrace Correia: I knocked on the door. I knocked lightly on the door and I stayed there. A couple of seconds and then I went away. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nGrace knocks. Lightly. No answer. Remember, Sophia says she was at home at this time, listening to music. Loudly.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Was it a pleasant reason for which you were trying to contact your daughter, or was it a matter that was of somewhat serious concern? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eGrace Correia: It was a serious concern. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: And it had to do with your bank account, correct? Grace Correia: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nDespite being divorced from Michael and estranged from her mother, Sophia’s name was still on BOTH of their bank accounts. Which meant that if Michael’s account was overdrawn, the bank could just pull funds from \u003cem\u003eGrace’s\u003c/em\u003e account to cover the deficit. And it DID. Grace’s balance… was zero. So on \u003cem\u003ethis \u003c/em\u003eday of all days… Sophia’s mother and her ex-husband were both trying to reach her with urgent money problems that \u003cem\u003eSophia\u003c/em\u003e, the prosecution asserted, had created. Buffet dish #1? Done.\r\n\r\nDish #2: A few days later, at Marlyne’s funeral, money was, supposedly, still on Sophia’s mind.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTom Duffy: Did you have any conversations with the defendant after the funeral that you have a distinct memory of? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDean Cole: Well, after the formal funeral arrangements were finished and everybody adjourned and filed into the lobby.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is Dean Cole, Marlyne’s brother. Another witness for the prosecution.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDean Cole: Sophia was there and came up to me at some point in the lobby there and said, uh, well, you know, uh, tomorrow we're gonna get to go down and read the will. Marlyne's will is gonna be read tomorrow. And it, it just, uh, struck me as, you know, uh, entirely inappropriate at a funeral to be talking about somebody's will. But that was the comment that was made to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSo there was the embezzlement. The overdrawn bank accounts. The alleged inappropriate inquiry into Marlyne’s will. And, for a final dish, documents discovered at Sophia and Brad’s house…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: …which indicated that Sophia had obtained credit cards in the name of Brad Johnson. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShane is reading an affidavit by Detective Rick Buckner, describing a police search a few days after the murder. Buckner and his team found a number of credit card statements under various names, all of which showed past-due balances… AND, this summary said, all of which were linked to Sophia. But Shane… once again, has questions. And more theories.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: That’s weird. What documents would indicate that a credit card that was obtained in Brad Johnson's name, which was found in the house of Brad Johnson, was obtained by Sophia? Because\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003emaybe Brad was in financial trouble prior to meeting Sophia. Maybe that's what actually was the motivation for inducing this 22 year old girl into embezzling from her employer.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad has denied any participation in the embezzlement. Any\u003cem\u003e witting\u003c/em\u003e participation, at least. And Shane, of course, will forever be Sophia’s brother FIRST. The one who credits her for raising and PROTECTING him. Giving him a foundation that would help him persevere through his own period of desperation, all the way to a law degree. So it’s clearly hard for him to square \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e sister with the one who, at best, stole tens of thousands of dollars, and at worst, committed murder. And it’s NOT hard for him to be skeptical of Brad when he denies any knowledge of the severity of the couple’s financial troubles.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: One of the things that I found out after the murder is that my wife had not been paying the bills like she was saying. So she was hiding things. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: She was in charge of the bills in the house?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Yes, she was. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: That is simply not accurate. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia… has told me \u003cem\u003eBrad \u003c/em\u003emanaged their money. Or \u003cem\u003emis\u003c/em\u003emanaged it, she would say.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: The credit cards and all the other debt that Brad and I had, Brad had before I even met Brad.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia says she had complained to her mother-in-law about Brad’s \u003cem\u003espending habits\u003c/em\u003e in particular.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Because I was heartsick over it. He was out spending money hand over fist.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSo Brad is either a dishonest super-spender, or he’s the guy in his mid thirties who handed over his finances to a new love in her early 20s, only to have her TANK them and commit a serious financial crime while he… was none the wiser? Shane, who himself is in his mid thirties now… doesn’t buy it. AGAIN. And doesn’t understand why more wasn’t made of this point during Sophia’s trial.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: 22-year-old girl approached by a 35-year-old man, competitor of a business, sees an emotional anger, exploits it, not saying that that's what happened, but that's what it looks like to me.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNo matter who was actually in-the-know in Sophia and Brad’s marriage, there was one more rude awakening with regards to the couple’s finances. Here’s Shane, reading from Detective Buckner’s affidavit again.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: I also noticed that the city of Vancouver had sent Sophia and Brad a disconnect notice for their water due to the bill being past due. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIn the days leading up to Marlyne’s murder, Brad and Sophia were tens of thousands of dollars in debt. They had the embezzlement hanging over them. They had a baby due in just a few months. And now, their water was about to be shut off.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: What is happening here?\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: The tornado just kept getting bigger and bigger.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Yeah. This is the walls closing in, man. Like you start messing with people's food, water, shelter, and a person who's desperate. That's reality hitting. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nA reality that \u003cem\u003elooks…\u003c/em\u003e increasingly desperate.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: My primary concern was making sure this money was paid back and that this baby that I'm pregnant with would be okay.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWhether the “bad acts” we’ve learned about were motivated by revenge, greed, desperation, or some combination… embezzlement? Alleged credit card fraud? — these crimes cannot be equated with murder. But still… I was unsettled. Maybe you are, too. Sophia is someone capable of deceit. But deceit \u003cem\u003eturned…\u003c/em\u003e deadly? And were these acts committed by Sophia alone? Sophia with Brad’s knowledge? Sophia AND Brad? In the end, it didn’t matter.  Only \u003cem\u003eSophia\u003c/em\u003e was on trial for Marlyne Johnson’s murder. And the jury… now had a LOT more to consider in making its decision.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: I have been handed the verdict forms by, uh, the jury. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s next time.\r\n\r\nBeyond All Repair is a production of WBUR, Boston’s NPR, and ZSP Media.\r\n\r\nIt’s written and reported by me, and this episode was co-written with producer extraordinaire, Sofie Kodner.\r\n\r\nMix and sound design by Matt Reed and production manager of WBUR Podcasts, Paul Vaitkus.

This show contains descriptions of violence and strong language.\r\n\r\nLast time on Beyond All Repair…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: Basically he says, I believe Sophia is stealing from me. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I went on a rampage. I felt wronged, I felt cheated, and it felt slimy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: I don't think you should marry her.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And of course, I went ahead and in turn did the exact same thing. I was wrong. I cheated him and I became slimy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eRick Buckner: You know, she was looking for money. That was her big motivation right there. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrad Johnson: The tornado just kept getting bigger and bigger.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Yeah. This is the walls closing in, man. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: my primary concern was making sure this money was paid back and that this baby that I'm pregnant with would be okay.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I have been handed the verdict forms by the jury in the matter of State versus Sophia Johnson…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt's April 9th, 2003. Over the last two weeks, 12 people have heard from  detectives and forensic analysts. They've heard from heartbroken family members of Marlyne Johnson. And they've heard from supposedly the only witness to her murder.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSean Correia: It turned out to be… my sister. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, after dozens of hours in the deliberation room, these dozen people have reached a decision as to whether or not Sophia Johnson... beyond a reasonable doubt... bludgeoned Marlyne to death.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I already felt like I was doing a death walk. It was so weird because I had walked these hallways now so many times.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia remembers being escorted down a dimly lit hallway, down three flights of stairs, down another hallway, to an elevator.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And when you get out, it's the courthouse. It felt like it was a full house. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt was. People shifting nervously, looking around, whispering to each other. I've watched this footage many times, thanks to those VHS tapes of the trial Sophia sent me. What do THEY think, I wonder, as I try to make out the grainy faces in the gallery. Is that Grace, Sophia's mom, sitting next to the woman in the yellow jacket? Is the woman in bright pink with the notebook Lyn Page, Richard Johnson's friend? And where’s Brad?\r\n\r\nSophia's chosen a black blazer for decision day. Her lawyer Therese Lavallee, is in a tan, pleated jacket that reminds you -- IF you had forgotten for a moment -- that this was 20-plus years ago. But it still feels fresh for Sophia.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Therese looked over at me and she said, let's not kid ourselves. This is not gonna be good. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese is furiously taking notes. She looks PISSED. A lot has already gone down that day in court. I'll get there. But right now, the verdict.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: We the jury find the defendant Sophia S. Johnson guilty of the crime of felony murder in the first degree…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: They said guilty. And I just, I cried. I couldn't even help it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe camera stays on the judge. But Sophia says she bowed her head. She thinks Therese may have squeezed her shoulders. And then, they listened to those 12 jurors reiterate their decision, one by one.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJuge: Ms. Moore, was this your verdict in the verdict of the jury….\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia was taken back to the elevator, back down the hallway, UP the three lights of stairs, down the other hallway... back to jail. She says one of the officers escorting her tried to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And he said, you know, Johnson, juries get it wrong all the time. They just do. Ask your attorney to get you an appellate attorney. And I said, why bother? He said, because as long as you're alive, there's hope. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI'm Amory Sivertson. From WBUR and ZSP Media, this is Beyond All Repair. Or... is it?\r\n\r\nChapter 6: Hope.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDanielle  (ACTOR): I have known the Johnson family for over thirteen years, when they say Marlyne was the glue that held this family together, that is no exaggeration.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nA couple months after the verdict was read, Sophia was called back to court for sentencing.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And they had something called victim impact statements. I'd never heard of that before. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is when the people most affected by a crime get to speak to the judge, and -- if they want -- directly to the decidedly guilty person.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: To add insult to injury, it was Danielle that read it on behalf of the family. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDanielle (ACTOR): I have seen them shed more tears than any one person should have to shed in a lifetime. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe reading of these statements wasn't included in the trial footage Sophia sent to me, but I do have written copies from the court records. So you're hearing a colleague read the words of a woman named Danielle Ruestig -- described at the top of her statement as a friend of the Johnson family. But in recent months, she’d become MORE than a friend… to Brad Johnson… Sophia’s husband.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: You gotta know, I loved that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBrad filed for divorce from Sophia just weeks after his mother was killed. But by this point, more than a year later, the divorce STILL hadn't been finalized.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I'd still loved my husband at that time.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nYou may remember... that Sophia was 6 months pregnant when Marlyne Johnson was killed in January of 2002. Her son was born that April. \u003cem\u003eDanielle\u003c/em\u003e, Brad's girlfriend, quickly became part of the baby boy's life. And a year or so later in court, she’d signal to Sophia that her victim impact statement was on behalf of \u003cem\u003ehim\u003c/em\u003e too.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eDanielle (ACTOR): The day that Marlyne’s son has to tell his now one-year-old son that it was his mom who killed his grandmother? That is when the tragedy will be lived all over again.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: She had my husband, she had my son. She had the life that was supposed to be mine…I cannot believe it is your 19th birthday today. I am happy and I am sad all at the same time.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEvery year, Sophia makes a video like this for her son… Eathen.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson:I hope that, wherever you are, that you know just how much you're loved. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEathen has never seen these videos. Sophia’s never sent them. Wouldn’t even know WHERE to send them. It’s possible Eathen will NEVER see them…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: It is hard to have a conversation with a person that you've never met that you love so much.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd it's possible Sophia will keep having these one-sided conversations -- monologues, really -- for years to come. But there's something she has for Eathen that no one else does.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I cannot help but go back to the day that you were born. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe story of his ACTUAL birth-day.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: It's the only real memory of you that I have.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003eI \u003c/em\u003eknow this story. Not the version she hopes to tell \u003cem\u003eEathen\u003c/em\u003e someday: the one that starts in a hospital. The version I heard, starts in a jail cell.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Being pregnant with him while incarcerated truly saved my life when this happened. It was too big. It was too overwhelming. I just, truly, I wanted to disappear. So the only thing I could focus on was keeping this baby safe and healthy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia says she was taken to the hospital the night before Eathen was born, after 3 days of contractions in the jail's medical ward. Two male correctional officers brought her there, and stayed in her hospital room the whole time, while an armed guard stood just outside the door.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: One of the officers, he was just a douchebag. He, uh, made a real scene of saying that he thought I was faking my labor contractions, that he'd never heard of someone being in labor for or having contractions for that long.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nEventually, Sophia says, a nurse came in and let her take a shower.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I was not allowed to take a shower for three days while I was in the medical unit and really wanted to just feel clean.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAs Sophia was getting out of the stall, she says she saw something... startling. Herself. In a full-length mirror. For the first time since being arrested 3 months earlier.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I couldn't believe how, how large my stomach was, and it looked so beautiful. I'd never seen it and how scared I was that this would be the first time I would see this. And it would also be the last time.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Eathen Marly Johnson was born. Marly is a tribute to his grandmother, Marlyne.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: I heard his tears turn into a whimper and then silence followed. I checked his fingers and his toes to make sure they were all there. I never stopped talking the whole time. He was quiet and his eyes were open.  He was looking at me and listened to the sound of my voice. I stroked his belly, his face, and his back. I held his hand and ran my finger over his little tiny feet. He was perfect by far the most beautiful baby I had ever seen. My heart was full of love. Making him and bringing him into the world safely was the greatest thing I had ever done. It will remain that way until I die. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis is an excerpt of an essay Sophia wrote when Eathen was about 4 or 5 months old, she tells me. She wrote it in jail, but she \u003cem\u003erecorded\u003c/em\u003e it within the last few years. I didn't know this essay or recording existed. Shane, Sophia's youngest brother, told me about it. Initially, Sophia didn't want anyone other than EATHEN hearing it. But Shane convinced her to send it to me, with THIS voice note…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eShane Correia: Sophia. The other thing here is that this podcast may honestly be the only thing you ever get to say to Ethan, so I think it's important for you to share that. And this might be your only opportunity to.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe question of what EATHEN thinks... looms large -- what he grew up hearing about Sophia, how he's made sense of it all for himself.\r\n\r\nEathen will be 22 years old this April. The same age Sophia was when she got pregnant with him. Of those 22 years, Sophia says she's spent 40 minutes with him. Total. The FIRST 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Which, if the jail had known, the doctors and the nurses would've gotten in trouble because they didn't want me to even hold him. They said, take him immediately.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nOne of the doctors offered to take a few pictures, which Sophia has sent to me. They're the only pictures Sophia has of her and Eathen together. In one of them, she beams down at the little red-faced peanut resting on her shoulder. Sophia looks proud. At ease. And, for a moment, totally unaware of what was coming. Here's more from that essay.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: When the midwife touched the top of my shoulders, I looked up. We have to take him now, Sophia.  Why? I asked. Brad is here, she said. He's waiting to see his son. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt wasn't just Brad there, Sophia told me. It was Brad and his new girlfriend, Danielle, whom he had started dating sometime in the 3 months since Sophia's arrest.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: They were at the hospital already waiting for him at the nursery. And every time they'd come in my room, they would ask, is there anything they could do? I would always say, just go kiss my son.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Sophia and Eathen both left the hospital. Eathen went home with Brad and Danielle. Sophia went back to jail.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: This is not goodbye, Eathen. This is, I'll see you later.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI will never forget what it was like hearing Sophia tell me about the birth of her son. And as much as I’ve tried to set this story aside when considering everything else -- her brother Sean's testimony, the Johnsons’ anecdotes about her, the embezzlement -- it is hard to understand how a woman who loves THIS much, could take another person's life.  It doesn’t mean she didn’t.\r\n\r\nDanielle (ACTOR): No sentence would be strong enough for Sophia, but we hope that justice will prevail in this matter.\r\n\r\nOne year later, Danielle… the woman who would go on to marry Sophia’s soon-to-be-EX-husband and raise her son was delivering a statement in court. Trying to ensure, on behalf of the Johnsons, that Sophia wouldn't be seeing that son... for a good long time.\r\n\r\nAnd Therese, Sophia's lawyer, tried to brace her.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: She said, the sentencing recommendation, Sophia, is really high and this judge is gonna give you every single day of it. I said, well, what is it she said?  517 months. 517 months. What is that? She said, 43 years.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n43 years. Sophia wouldn't just be missing Eathen's childhood. He'd be middle-aged by the time she got out of prison. As the judge announced the decision, she added: \"She never needs to be on the streets again.\"\r\n\r\n\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia was sent to a prison in western Washington. Really, she was sent BACK there. By the time her murder trial began in 2003, Sophia had already started serving a 3-year sentence for the EMBEZZLEMENT I mentioned in the last episode. She had essentially pleaded guilty to stealing the 70-ish-thousand-dollars she was proven to have taken from her former employer, County Communications. It's actually much more complicated than that, but on paper, her plea was as good as guilty in terms of what it would mean for her going forward. And it would come back to bite her.\r\n\r\nBut right now, she was hearing Detective Rick Buckner's voice in her head...and a warning he'd given her when she was first arrested for Marlyne's murder.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: What he said is, I hope for your sake you didn't do this. ‘Cause you're not gonna like prison. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAfter her sentencing for the murder, Sophia was moved from the medium security part of the prison... to MAXIMUM. And the level of competition there, she says, was FIERCE.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: They were doing three-legged races. They were doing egg toss. And it was officer and inmate playing on the same team.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nShortly after getting back to prison, the facility was having… a field day of sorts, Sophia says. There she was, standing across from a sergeant. In prison. About to do an egg toss.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And he is like, okay, what's your name? Johnson. Okay Johnson. I like to win. Do you like to win? Because if not, you're gonna need to switch with your neighbor.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nPrison wasn't all one big egg toss, Sophia says, but I was honestly shocked at the way she described it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson:Great job, great roommate. I'm in classes that I love. I have a life.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia worked in the kitchen, which was perfect because this woman LOVES to cook. She says she took a ceramics class, she was in the chess club...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: They had Toastmasters and I did that and loved it. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt's a speech club, basically. Women at this prison were also allowed to wear make-up and plain clothes. No more head-to-toe monochrome. They'd have picture days in the prison's gymnasium. Sophia's shown me a few pictures from her time there. In one of them, she's sitting on a stool in front of a backdrop of pink and white hearts… wearing a fitted white t-shirt, khakis, her characteristic red lipstick, and a confident smile. She sent this one to her mom, with whom she had only occasional contact at this time.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And she said, I swear to God, I hate to say this, but you look like the poster child for prison. I'm like, what does that even mean? She's like, I don't know, but it just… how are you doing so good? And I didn't know how to answer her because I, I am doing good, I'm doing great, but probably because I've accepted my role, I've accepted my world.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt was a world without Eathen, her son, but it was also the best she could probably hope for, given that she'd be spending the next 43 years of her life  there.\r\n\r\nBut then, about a year and a half into her sentence... Sophia got a phone call in prison.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And I picked up the phone and Therese was excited. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese Lavallee, Sophia’s lawyer.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: And she said, Sophia, are you sitting down? And I said, I won, didn't I? She said, you won.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nSophia had WON… a new trial. More in a minute.\r\n\r\nIt's late January, 2005. Sophia is feeling more at peace in prison than anyone could have expected, and more than the people who believe she's a murderer would have ever WANTED… when her lawyer Therese calls… saying… that her murder conviction had been THROWN OUT.\r\n\r\nWHAAAAT. Yes. It goes back to the day Sophia’s verdict was delivered… in April of 2003. Remember I said that a lot had already gone down in court that day? What had gone down... was THIS.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: I am also here to, again, request that this court direct a mistrial at this time\u003c/strong\u003e.\r\n\r\nA MISTRIAL. As in, Therese was asking the judge to START OVER. Because, the day before the verdict was reached, the judge had dismissed one of the 12 original jurors and replaced her with an alternate.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: I believe that what occurred yesterday, uh, is an interference with Ms. Johnson's right to a fair trial. It essentially amounted to reconstituting the original 12 jurors because we had a juror who, uh, was out of the same mindset of the majority of the rest of the jurors. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese is alleging that this juror was dismissed because she was preventing the jury from reaching a verdict. They were deadlocked, in other words, which… would normally… lead to a mistrial. The foreperson, or lead juror, said the dismissed juror was being difficult, emotional, uncooperative. The dismissed juror HERSELF told Therese...\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: She indicated under no certain, uncertain terms that that was an absolute lie, that that never occurred, that anything that occurred within the jury room was simply the product of their deliberation.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThis juror was IMPROPERLY dismissed, Therese claimed. The JUDGE'S response:\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: I refuse to stop the jury deliberations. I don't see this as being extraordinary and striking circumstances that would indicate a substantial injustice at this point.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAt this point. But at a DIFFERENT point, nearly two years later, a different JUDGE... would find otherwise. That judge would also rule... that the BAILIFF in Sophia's 2003 trial had had improper communications with the foreperson of her jury. An injustice HAD occurred, this ruling indicated.\r\n\r\nSophia, amazingly, was getting a second chance. And her lawyer, Therese, would get a second chance at DEFENDING her. To a new jury. A new judge. In a whole new trial.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge:  Mr. Kinnie, would you give an opening? Yes, sir. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nIt's now November of 2005. Sophia is back in the Clark County courthouse, facing a new prosecutor, too. Mike Kinnie. His prosecutorial presence isn't as… \u003cem\u003ecommanding\u003c/em\u003e as his physical one. He's soft-spoken, measured. The judge often has to ask him to speak up, for the recording.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMike Kinnie: On January 10, 2002, sometime a little after 12:20 in the afternoon, Marlyne Johnson had completed her shopping…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Therese Lavallee, planting the same seed she hoped would take root in 2003.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: This entire case hinges on Sean Correia’s credibility.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe illegitimacy of Sean, Sophia's brother's, testimony.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Sean Correia’s name permeates this trial. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut Therese had a couple other tricks up her sleeve this time. Witnesses she didn't have in 2003. Including a forensic expert named Kay Sweeney.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: And he won't tell you who committed this murder, but he will tell you who didn't…Sir, were you asked to review evidence relating to the death of Marlyne Johnson? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Yes, I was. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nTherese hired Kay Sweeney to give the evidence in the case a once-over, basically. See if he found anything that other forensic analysts HADN’T up to that point. Kay’s worked in forensics since the 60s. First, for the Seattle police department.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: So I was doing chemical analysis, I was doing trace evidence, I was doing blood analysis, I was doing firearms work…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nKay then worked for the state of Washington’s crime lab before going out on his own in the 90s, and on one of my reporting trips out West, Kay showed me around his crime lab.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Wow, look at this. Oh man, office and lab all in one. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nBut \u003cem\u003ejust\u003c/em\u003e the downstairs. The upstairs... is Kay's crime scene reconstruction zone... where he literally rebuilds crime scenes to the exact dimensions and angles to try to figure out how a crime played out. It's Kay's specialty, as Therese tried to highlight during his testimony.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: How many homicide reconstructions have you participated in? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: I've participated in roughly 750. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nKay Sweeney didn't have much time -- or EVIDENCE -- to work with in Sophia's Johnson's case. But he did have a piece of the wall next to where Marlyne's body was found and the fireplace tongs used in the attack. And after analyzing those two pieces… Kay had an interesting discovery to share with the jury. Something that hadn't come up at all in Sophia's first trial.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Were you able to render a conclusion as to the likely or the probability of the hand used by the perpetrator to inflict these injuries? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: And what was your conclusion? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: I see evidence of left-handed use of the weapon on the scene.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nLeft-handed use of the weapon. This is based on two things, Sweeney says. The first is what are called \"skip marks\" -- marks left on the wall by the fireplace tongs as they were swung, grazing -- or, in some cases -- impacting it. Marlyne's body was found in a corner between two walls, just on the other side of the door from the garage leading into the basement. Kay showed me pictures of this corner, and lo and behold…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: The skip marks are on the left wall. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Right. On the left wall \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nGiven the position of Marlyne's body -- essentially parallel to the left wall with her head closest to the corner --  and the direction of the skip marks, which appear to go from left-to-right and up-to-down, Kay's assessment is that the assailant had to be left-handed.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: You see the angle? It's like that. It's not like this for a right hander. It's like that for a left hander. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Huh. And do we know if her brother Sean was left handed? Were you able to find that out? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Um, I didn't, I wasn't told, but apparently he was ambidextrous. He did things both ways. But she is not. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nI can confirm, having watched Sophia take notes in many a video call with me, that she is NOT left-handed. I CANNOT confirm that Sean is ambidextrous. Though that is what his ex-wife Cynthia told me. But Kay had more to show me. And it was hard to look at.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: So here's the layout and…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nWe're looking at a photo of the crime scene. Marlyne's body had been removed by the time this picture was taken, but the trace of her is very much still there. There's a large bloodstain on the carpet near the corner where her head was. And curving up the wall -- the left wall, mostly -- from that area on the floor... is a lot of blood.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: The crime laboratory was saying all this stuff is cast off. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThe \u003cem\u003estate's\u003c/em\u003e crime laboratory, Kay means. As in, the PROSECUTION’S forensic analysis.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: It's not cast off, that's blood spatter. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: What do they mean, cast off? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Cast off is when you swing a weapon and you cause an injury to a person, then you get blood transferred to the weapon. Right? So when you swing it again, the blood comes off and is deposited on the wall or whatever furniture in the region. Not this kind of things, which are arcing. It's arcing this way, arcing this way. That's not the pattern of a swing of a weapon. It comes from down here, up. So that's impact spatter. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nImpact spatter: blood that traveled directly from Marlyne's body upon impact... to the wall. This spatter also arcs up to the left on the wall next to Marlyne, like the skip marks created by the tongs.\r\n\r\nThose skip marks offered Kay another important clue, he told me.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: So a skip mark gives you the maximum height of that person's ability to strike the wall. Okay, for Sophia, she's a lot shorter than the guy. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: Right, her brother, who is what I've found about 5'11 and Sophia is about 5'3 5'4. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nKay points to a particular skip mark in the crime scene photo that's about three-quarters of the way up the wall, to my very UN-scientific eye.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: I can calculate how far that skip mark is above the floor, and there's one right there. That's way too high for her to have created.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: Were you able to render a conclusion as to the probable height of the perpetrator? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eTherese Lavallee: What was that conclusion? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: I could determine that someone my height around five 11 could do that. A person in the range of five feet, four inches tall, uh, probably not likely, they could do that. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nNow, not everyone was buying Kay’s forensic analysis… and how certain he seemed about evidence that, often, is considered less so.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eAmory Sivertson: I have heard that blood splatter evidence is, can be dicey, can be tricky, can be unreliable.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Well, it's not unreliable. The evidence is not unreliable. It's the interpretations that can be unreliable.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: When I was in the Crime Laboratory, working as a forensic scientist, the prosecutors were my friend because they wanted, they wanted my work. They wanted to use my work. Now, when I find something wrong or something different, they come unglued. And so I have a lot of, I guess, professional enemies within the prosecutorial group.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nKay’s been accused in the past of mishandling evidence… altering it, even. He says… this is all smear by bitter opponents. And he stressed to me… it's never mattered to him WHICH side he was working for on a particular case.That he's beholden ONLY to something money can’t buy or tamper with: the truth.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Many times, I find something that's spectacular and I report it to the defense and they say, well that's no help, you're not going to testify in my case. I said, oh, okay.  The defense, the defense has hired me to find things. I don't think that way. I'm focused on the evidence. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of Sophia Johnson, Kay says, the evidence was clear.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: A person her height couldn't have done that.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nMostly…\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eKay Sweeney: Obviously, it doesn't mean she wasn't involved, I mean…\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nKay Sweeney’s forensic analysis in this second trial suggested a very different version of events than the one Sean had given in Sophia’s first trial. A story told by evidence, he said, of a 5-foot-11, left-handed or ambidextrous assailant. NOT a 5-foot-4, six-month-pregnant one. BUT WAS. SOPHIA. INVOLVED?\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of everyone, and the dismay of her attorney, she was about to answer that question… for herself. \u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eJudge: Please be seated.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nComing up, SOPHIA takes the stand. But the story she tells the jury… is different than the one she’s told me.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMike Kinnie: You lied to the police a lot, don't you? \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eSophia Johnson: Yes. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eMorgen: What the hell? I don’t know, I feel like I got punched in the face. \u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eI knew that my life was in my own hands, but I didn't know what the truth was anymore.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n\r\nThat’s next time…\r\n\r\nBeyond All Repair is a production of WBUR, Boston’s NPR, and ZSP Media.\r\n\r\nIt’s written and reported by me, Amory Sivertson.

It’s a reliable Mother’s Day fallback plan, but if you really want to take time to smell the flowers, beat the rush and visit the week before.","\u003ca href=\"https://www.bostonharborislands.org/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBoston Harbor Island ferry service resumes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e — mid-to-late May\u003c/strong\u003e","Ferries, they’re not only for commuting.

It also acquired, by questionable colonialist means, a large collection of antiquities from countries in Africa and Asia.

As the Seaport exploded with high rises, the ICA established itself as the trendiest of the area’s large art institutions, a destination for not only visual art, but also cutting-edge music and performance arts. It continues to build its permanent collection, with a focus on 20th- and 21st-century art by American women. In 2018, the museum opened a space in East Boston called the Watershed, which presents one large-scale exhibition every summer.","You may have heard of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gardnermuseum.org/\"\u003eIsabella Stewart Gardner Museum\u003c/a\u003e because of an \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/podcasts/lastseen/last-seen-season-one\"\u003einfamous night\u003c/a\u003e in 1990 when robbers broke in, tied up the security guards and made off with 13 works of art.

The museum was the passion project of Isabella Stewart Gardner, a wealthy Bostonian who amassed a vast and varied art collection and designed a stunning building in the Fenway to house it — and herself. (She lived in private quarters on the museum’s top floor.) Gardner bequeathed the museum to the city after her death in 1924, stipulating the collection remain exactly as she arranged it. A visit to the Gardner is a bit like a trip back in time and into its creator’s personal world and aesthetic obsessions. The museum keeps up Gardner’s legacy of hosting performing artists and musicians, and in 2012, a new wing for contemporary exhibitions was completed.","\u003ch3\u003eGalleries and smaller museums\u003c/h3\u003e","Outside the “Big Three,” the Greater Boston area — and broader Massachusetts — boasts a plethora of worthwhile museums and galleries.","\u003cul class=\"spaced\"\u003e \t\u003cli\u003eThe (free) \u003ca href=\"https://www.brandeis.edu/rose/\"\u003eRose Art Museum\u003c/a\u003e at Brandeis University in Waltham is one of my favorites, both for its innovative exhibitions and its deep collection.

After suffering through the most puritanical stretch of American cinema since the Hays Code — thanks in no small part to Hollywood studios trying to curry favor with the censorship boards of oppressive regimes by making blockbusters as chaste and inoffensive as possible — it feels like folks are finally fooling around again on the big screen. From the “furious jumping” of “Poor Things” to the pumped iron of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/03/14/love-lies-bleeding-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eLove Lies Bleeding\u003c/a\u003e,” along with bawdy comedies like “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/08/31/queer-teen-comedy-bottoms-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eBottoms\u003c/a\u003e,” “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/07/06/new-film-joy-ride-is-a-gleeful-exuberantly-filthy-celebration-of-misadventure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eJoy Ride\u003c/a\u003e” and “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/02/22/ethan-coen-drive-away-dolls-film-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eDrive-Away Dolls\u003c/a\u003e,” it’s a happier, hornier era at the multiplex these days. You can add Luca Guadagnino’s “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/salp/challengers#challengersTickets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eChallengers\u003c/a\u003e” to the list of movies you might not want to go see with your grandmother.","This wickedly entertaining soap opera about a love triangle of tennis pros has been engineered as a vehicle for zeitgeist superstar Zendaya, who also produced the picture alongside former Sony studio head Amy Pascal. It’s one of those cinematic coming out parties where an actress famous for playing teenagers is finally allowed to strut her stuff as an adult, deliberately raising eyebrows with racy material while establishing she’s capable of more than just being a girlfriend to Spider-Man and \u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/02/29/denis-villeneuve-dune-part-two-film-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003espace messiahs\u003c/a\u003e. The time-jumping “Challengers” skips around over 15 years or so, following our three main characters from high school into their early 30s. And if it’s not always easy to believe that Zendaya is whichever age the movie says she’s supposed to be at the moment, she makes you want to, which is more important.","The former Disney kid stars as Tashi Duncan, a tennis prodigy on her way to Stanford who already signed an endorsement deal with Adidas in her teens. (Think one of the Williams sisters if they’d been allowed to go outside.) At a tournament, she catches the eye of “Fire and Ice,” two waggish hotshots and childhood best friends played by Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor. Faist’s Art Donaldson is the sensible one, a percentage player aiming to use his skills to secure a good education. O’Connor’s Patrick Zweig is more gifted, more reckless and an irresistible lout. Unlike the serious young strivers around him, Patrick’s got a devil-may-care attitude that can only come from family money. The three get up to some steamy shenanigans on the first night they meet, with Zendaya’s Tashi teasing the bi-curious boys into competing for her phone number.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","But that was all a long time ago. In the present day, Art is a successful professional player in the midst of a career skid. His wife/manager Tashi — who we notice has a nasty-looking scar on her knee — has enrolled him in a low-stakes challenger tournament sponsored by a tire dealership in nowhere New Rochelle, trying to get the poor guy’s confidence back up so he can take one last run at the U.S. Open. But as luck (or the movie gods) might have it, Art has to play against Patrick. The former up-and-comer is now down and out, sleeping in his car and angling for a way back into Tashi’s heart, even if that means crushing her husband on the court.","The hugely energetic picture volleys back and forth through time, showing us the entanglements that got the trio from there to here. It’s structured similarly to a tennis match in which we keep score via the rising and falling fortunes of our main players. This kind of years-spanning story is usually stretched out into a streaming miniseries these days, and it’s easy to imagine checking out somewhere around the fourth or fifth episode. Luckily for us, “Challengers” has been conceived as a movie, so it \u003cem\u003emoves\u003c/em\u003e.","As previously seen in his “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/12/22/new-movies-holidays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eCall Me by Your Name\u003c/a\u003e” and “A Bigger Splash,” Guadagnino is maker of shamelessly sensual cinematic experiences, here reveling in the beauty and athleticism of his actors. Every shot of Zendaya appears explicitly designed to show off that she’s got the longest legs in show business. And if you like slow-motion close-ups of sweaty, muscular men’s thighs, have I got a picture for you. Forget about franchises and worldbuilding, “Challengers” is a return to the simpler, more primal pleasure of watching ridiculously hot people fall for each other on a giant screen.","It’s a treat to see a Hollywood movie this devoted to drinking in the sex appeal of its stars. Zendaya so naturally commands the camera, it couldn’t have been easy finding two dudes capable of holding the screen alongside her. Faist made such a malevolent Riff in Steven Spielberg’s misguided “West Side Story” remake that they had to have someone else sing “Gee, Officer Krupke” because he was too damn scary for the song. So it’s a surprise to see how kind and tender the actor can be as Art, the sort of fellow who’s become okay with the idea that he’s always been his wife’s second choice. (It mostly doesn’t bother him anymore. Mostly.) But the biggest shocker here is O’Connor, who I’m told played Prince Charles on Netflix’s “The Crown” but I can’t imagine how somebody so brashly charming was cast as one of history’s goofiest simps. He’s got the same raggedy allure Elliott Gould had in the 1970s, unkempt and irreverent in ways entirely at odds with our contemporary, corporate-friendly culture. It’s scandalously funny to watch him using Tinder like an Airbnb when he can’t afford a motel. Part of you roots for Patrick even when he’s being completely rotten. This is a star-making performance.","\u003cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","“Challengers” was filmed in Boston during the summer of 2022, which is why you might remember sightings of Zendaya and her boyfriend Tom Holland at Tatte. Cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom flattens out the blankest concrete alleys downtown to pass for the screenplay’s purgatorial New Rochelle. (Eagle-eyed viewers will spot that Tashi and Art are staying at The Ritz-Carlton on Avery Street, and yes, that’s Kenny the doorman playing himself.) The tennis scenes were shot at Wheaton College, where Guadagnino and Mukdeeprom went wild with cockamamie camera tricks and racket-POV shots to make an incredibly boring sport (sorry, fans) visually thrilling. This is a very sexy movie with no actual onscreen fornication. Everything’s foreplay for the tennis matches, so it’s appropriate that they’re filmed in such orgiastic fashion.","The sometimes wobbly pacing is powered along by the best score in ages from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, all throbbing techno beats and dirty sighs that Guadagnino mixes distractingly high during the dialogue scenes, making these nondescript hotel rooms feel like nightclubs. (It’s a welcome return to form for the composers, whose aural wallpaper for recent prestige slop like “Mank” and “Empire of Light” had me quipping to a friend that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become Thomas Newman.)","“Challengers” may not be anyone’s idea of a great film, but it’s the kind I wish we saw more of: unabashedly lusty even if that means being a bit ridiculous sometimes. One floridly melodramatic encounter between Tashi and Patrick in an alley behind the Ritz is punctuated by squalls of litter and stray newspapers whipping through the air, as if a twister had been stirred up by their roiling passions.","Maybe the biggest relief is that the script never resorts to any labored tennis metaphors about love meaning nothing, etc. (Were this only true for some of the early reviews. Oy.) Screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes is the husband of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/06/09/past-lives-celine-song-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ePast Lives\u003c/a\u003e” writer-director Celine Song. I understand that fiction is fiction and nobody likes an armchair therapist but still, the contrast between the films they’ve made about married women meeting up with their old boyfriends is kind of hilarious.","\u003chr /\u003e","\u003cem\u003e“Challengers” is now \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/salp/challengers#challengersTickets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ein

We'd just like to see it get done. The community needs it. We need it.”","Town officials said Norwood taxpayers are spending millions of dollars on additional costs including new ambulances — which run about $450,000 per truck — as well as vehicle maintenance, fuel and overtime.","\u003cspan data-index=\"5\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Hospital used to see around 40,000 patients in the emergency department annually, and admitted roughly 10,000, according to data the state Center for Health Information and Analysis compiled for WBUR. The hospital was profitable, according to CHIA data.","The hospital was also an economic driver for the town. It stood in the community for a century, until the rainstorm in June 2020 that sent water gushing into the building and forced the evacuation of patients.","“It was surreal,” said Joan Ballantyne, who worked as an intensive care nurse in Norwood. She recalled going to the building weeks after the flood to pick up her belongings — a spare pair of clogs, extra scrubs, a couple of books. “They went in the bin,” she said. “They all got soaked and had to be thrown out.”","The hospital’s closure displaced more than 1,000 jobs, including Ballantyne’s. She moved to a different Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, and plans to retire in the coming months.","“I certainly would have gone back [to Norwood],” she said. “I really enjoyed working there. But now, it’s too late.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"6\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Norwood Hospital was small compared to the sprawling medical centers of Boston. But emergency department nurse Kathy Reardon said it had the staff and equipment to treat heart patients who needed cardiac catheterization, something not every hospital can do.","“We had it down to a science: One, two, three, and off to the cath lab they went,” she said.","Reardon, who worked at Norwood Hospital for 32 years and now works at Steward’s Morton Hospital in Taunton, said nurses noticed that something wasn’t right with Steward’s finances several years ago. She said she had trouble ordering supplies, including paper for the electrocardiogram device that charts patients' heartbeats, and tubing needed to administer certain medications.","\u003cspan data-index=\"7\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Reardon worries about how the financial crisis at Steward will affect patients and health care workers across the state. Already, many hospitals are so crowded patients routinely receive care in emergency department hallways. Norwood’s closure only exacerbated crowding at other nearby hospitals.","The Steward hospitals “need to stay afloat,” Reardon said. “If this system crashes, it would be an absolute catastrophe for this state.”","Steward declined to comment for this story. Its landlord, Alabama-based Medical Properties Trust, or MPT, which controls the Norwood property, did not respond to a request for comment.","Gov. Maura Healey has said she wants Steward to transfer its hospitals to new owners and leave Massachusetts. Administration officials declined to comment specifically on Norwood.","In documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Steward officials laid out plans for selling their hospitals at auction over the next several weeks. But the plans didn't mention Norwood Hospital, which is currently a construction site, not a functioning medical facility.","\u003cspan data-index=\"8\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The old hospital was demolished after the flooding in 2020, and construction of a $325 million new building eventually began. But the work, led by the construction firm Suffolk, slowed down and came to a stop over the past several months as workers stopped getting paid, according to public officials.","Norwood Hospital’s website \u003ca href=\"https://www.norwood-hospital.org/OurNewHospital\"\u003estill promises\u003c/a\u003e a new building, with 130 private patient rooms, will be ready “soon.” But the construction site sits mostly empty. On a recent visit, only a few people were visible working there. The hulking steel skeleton of a building peeked through unfinished outer walls. Town officials said workers are weatherproofing the partially built structure.","“It's just such a gut-wrenching feeling to drive by that site,” said Bob Donnelly, chairman of the Norwood Board of Selectmen. “It’s a promise that has been broken.”","Years ago, Donnelly said, two of his siblings suffered cardiac arrests. Both were taken to Norwood Hospital — and recovered.","“I often wonder whether or not that would have been the case if the hospital was not there,” he said. “Even just a few minutes’ difference could have made a significant difference in their recovery.”","\u003cspan data-index=\"9\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","Still, Tony Mazzucco, general manager of the town, said he’s optimistic another health care provider will see the value in Norwood Hospital, take over the site and finish the work Steward started.","“I'm confident there's going to be a hospital there,” he said. “It's just a matter of time.”","Massachusetts needs more hospital beds, Mazzucco noted.","\"The state's out of capacity,\" he said. \"Where else are you going to be able to address that capacity issue quicker than a hospital that's already 20% built?”"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/05/07/steward-bankruptcy-hospitals-massachusetts","title":"The 3rd-largest Mass. hospital system is in bankruptcy.

I’m ready to get out there and get after it.","The Lincoln commuter rail station is a desolate brick building right across the street from a small shopping plaza — a rare commercial hub in a town primarily known for its green space.

The findings add to evidence suggesting they pose a public health risk for millions of residents in Massachusetts and other states, primarily in the Northeast and the Midwest.","The researchers looked at data from combined sewer overflows — or CSOs — along the Merrimack River, and medical records from nearby hospitals. They found a 22% increase in the risk of visiting an emergency room for gastrointestinal illness after large sewage discharges, and a 62% increase in risk after very large releases.","\"Even though you would assume that sewage in a river or a lake could lead to people being sick, there's actually relatively few studies that have looked at this link,\" said Beth Haley, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author on the study.","The researchers also found the highest risk of gastrointestinal illness, such as severe vomiting and diarrhea, occurred four days after the discharge. Haley said this may indicate that people are getting sick from viruses, such as norovirus, which have a short incubation period.","The Merrimack River, like other rivers in Massachusetts, is also a source of drinking water. Haley said she expected to find a higher risk of gastrointestinal illness in communities that draw drinking water from the Merrimack, but did not.

I love grilling seafood, vegetables, meat and poultry, and even fruit. Yes, the grill caramelizes fruit's natural sugars. Here are three extremely simple recipes for early summer meals. In fact, you could make all three and have a beautiful all-grilled meal.","The first recipe is for grilled shrimp with a green cilantro-chile-lime sauce with grilled limes.  The shrimp are lightly marinated and then grilled whole, with or without the shell. Then they're served with grilled lime halves and the slightly spicy sauce.","Next up is a vegetable that doesn’t get enough attention. Broccolini takes beautifully to a hot grill and is tossed with a simple miso butter. It’s a great side dish or the basis for a summer salad.","And finally, grilled pineapple dusted with ginger-scented sugar. These juicy, sweet slices of pineapple work in a variety of ways, both sweet and savory. Think of grilled pineapple paired with ice cream or butter cookies. Or served alongside grilled shrimp or fish, poultry or meat. You could even use it as the basis of a grilled pineapple salsa.","None of these recipes takes any significant amount of time.

And it is the first where such a law has been declared unconstitutional.","“This is an important win for educators and students in New Hampshire and sends a clear message across the country that bans on inclusive education are unconstitutional and will not stand,” Emerson Sykes, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a press release. (The ACLU’s affiliate in New Hampshire represented plaintiffs in the case.)","The New Hampshire Department of Education declined to comment on the ruling, pointing NHPR to the Attorney General’s office. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office said state officials are “currently reviewing the court’s order and will consider next steps including whether to appeal.” If the ruling is appealed, it would head to the U.S. Circuit of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston.","Here’s more details on what the ruling means, and what we know about how the law was working in practice.","\u003ch3\u003eWhat law was just declared unconstitutional?\u003c/h3\u003e","The law, called the “Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education,” was passed in 2021. Supporters for the law said it was needed to curb schools’ increased focus on training, curriculum and conversations regarding diversity, race, gender and racism.","The law prohibited educators from teaching that anyone is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, even if unconsciously. It also prohibited them from teaching that people “cannot and should not attempt to treat others without regard” to any protected legal category, such as sexual orientation, race, or mental or physical disability. Though vague in what lessons it prohibited, the stakes of the law were high: a teacher found to have violated it could lose their license.","The law mirrored policies introduced by Republicans across the country, including former President Donald Trump, who used this language in an executive order restricting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.","\u003ch3\u003eHas any teacher been charged with violating the law since it took effect?\u003c/h3\u003e","No. The New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights is responsible for investigating alleged violations of the law, and so far, it has docketed one complaint against a teacher. As of press time, this has not led to any formal violation.","The New Hampshire Department of Education also fields concerns from staff and parents that teachers might be violating the law, and in some cases the agency has conducted less official investigations into those teachers. Attorneys for the ACLU-NH argued that these inquiries, while less formal, also contributed to a chilling effect on teachers.","\u003ch3\u003eWhat was the lawsuit about?\u003c/h3\u003e","Soon after the law passed, a coalition that included teachers’ unions, LGBTQ and disability rights advocates and the ACLU-NH \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2021-12-20/nh-nea-lawsuit-aclu-divisive-concepts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003esued the state\u003c/a\u003e. They alleged that the law was so unclear that educators couldn’t understand how to comply with it. They also argued that it invited arbitrary enforcement, violating teachers’ 14th amendment protections.","In court, lawyers for that coalition argued that the law was having a chilling effect on classrooms, noting that some teachers were forgoing certain books and discussions out of fear these might run afoul of the law. This included Patrick Keefe, a high school English teacher at Campbell High School in Litchfield, who testified that he was worried he would get in trouble for lessons connecting Toni Morrison’s \"Beloved\" to contemporary issues, and Alison O’Brien, whose \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/education/2023-08-24/new-hampshire-schools-divisive-concepts-law-teacher-complaints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003elessons on the Harlem Renaissance\u003c/a\u003e unexpectedly prompted an inquiry from the education department’s misconduct investigator.","State attorneys argued that the language of the law itself, in addition to written guidance issued by the New Hampshire Attorney General, provided sufficient information on how to comply.","The judge was unconvinced by the state’s arguments, writing that while the language “may appear straightforward at first glance, their ambiguity comes to light when put into practice.”","He wrote that the resulting ambiguity puts teachers “in the untenable position of having to wager their careers on a guess or else refrain from discussing matters that implicate the banned concepts altogether.”","“This lack of clarity renders the statute unconstitutionally vague,” he added.","\u003ch3\u003eNew Hampshire Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut is one of the defendants named in the lawsuit. How did the judge interpret his role?\u003c/h3\u003e","Edelblut’s support and interpretation of the law got significant attention in the lawsuit. In his ruling, the judge pointed to op-eds that Edelblut wrote in support of the law to support his finding that it was being applied arbitrarily.","“The record demonstrates that those charged with enforcing the law have relied on Commissioner Edelblut’s personal opinions on what is appropriate instruction, as expressed in his op-ed articles, to guide their efforts,” Barbadoro wrote.","A recent investigation by NHPR and APM reports \u003ca class=\"Link\" href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/education/2024-04-22/education-commissioner-frank-edelblut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cms-ai=\"0\"\u003efound a similar pattern\u003c/a\u003e at the Department of Education, in which the education commissioner used his oversight powers to amplify complaints against teachers related to topics of race, racism, and LGBTQ identity.","\u003cem\u003eThis story is a production of the New England News Collaborative.

It just makes you want to 'Ah!'","\u003cem\u003eRYAN HOLIDAY: There's a great quote from Flaubert that I think about. He says, there was this moment, he says, between Cicero and Marcus Aurelius, he said, when the gods had died out, but Christ had not yet come, he said that man stood alone in the universe.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: This is Ryan Holiday. He says that time of humanism healing a loss of faith, neatly bookended by the ancient Greeks and Romans, is captured by one thing. The practice of stoicism.","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY: To me, the essence of Stoic philosophy, what I feel like I can't repeat enough times, is this idea that we don't control what happens, we control how we respond to what happens.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd the idea is that the Stoic responds always with courage, self discipline, justice, and wisdom. So that's what we're doing. And that's what I find myself saying in all these different mediums. And what you find when you pick up Marcus Aurelius, or Seneca, or Epictetus, or Cleanthes, or Zeno, or any of the ancients who wrote about this stuff, is some version of that repeated over and over again in all the different ways and contexts that a person can encounter it.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Holiday is a best-selling author and podcaster, whose millions of adherents follow his interpretations of Stoic philosophy.","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY [ONLINE VIDEO]: Your opinions are your problem. Epictetus says, look, when you're offended, you have to realize that it takes two to tango. He says, we are complicit in the taking of offense. You don't have to have an opinion about this.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eYou don't have to take it personally. You can think the best of it. You can ignore it.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY: So I was in college and I got introduced to Marcus Aurelius's meditations. Someone recommended that I read the Stoics and I was sitting at the table in my college apartment, and it's just this magical book. You're reading the private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world, who's talking to himself about how to be a better person, how to manage his temper, how to think about his habits, what his obligations as a human being are.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: That's quite a remarkable revelation for a young person. The mighty Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, a man who controlled a sizable portion of the known human world at the time. Even he needed a guiding philosophy to allow sane passage through the world, a Caligula he was not.","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY: What I was interested in is the same reason that a lot of young men and young women, but professionals and ambitious people are attracted to stoicism.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAt first, it's about what it can do for you, how to help you manage your emotions, good habits, good practices. How to exist in a world of frustrating, obnoxious, annoying people. \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eQuestions to ask yourself every single day from the Stoics. What is the worst case scenario? That's the exercise of premeditatio malorum, planning in advance for adversity.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd then Seneca also says, you should ask yourself at the end of each day, where did I fall short? Where did I improve? And where can I do better?\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Now, stoicism, today, does find some of its biggest fans amongst the Silicon Valley set, or Broicism, as Holiday jokes. But if it were just that, just tech bros trying to optimize their emotional regulation for maximum efficiency, then stoicism's modern resurgent really wouldn't be worth note.","But millions of people, from all walks of life, in fact, are turning to stoicism. Men and women, white collar and blue, people of all ages, seeking something to help find direction and peace.","HOLIDAY: We've seen a collapse in trust in so many different institutions, schools don't teach the humanities the way they once did, and people have turned away from the church.","And so philosophy as a guide to the good life, how to be a good person and how to flourish as a person. I think takes on a new residence and a new urgency in a world of similar sort of decline. And then also, as you said, turbulence and dysfunction.","CHAKRABARTI: But in the grand tradition of American self-reliance and self regard. It can seem like the modern day practice of stoicism is pretty self-absorbed. All about me, all about what the ancient Greeks and Romans can do for me and my inability to cope. But holiday says no. That's not what it's about at all. He says, in fact, what people don't realize when they pick up his books, podcasts, or online posts, is that stoicism makes people better for themselves.","And for the societies they live in.","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY: And so I think this idea of stoicism opening you up and making you better, as opposed to hardening you and making you more disinterested, is a sort of a secret part of the stoic trajectory that a lot of people who maybe are reacting against how popular it is online or the sort of quotification of it, are missing.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eThat's the point. What draws you in is all these things it can do for you, but if you're doing it right, it opens you up and it gives you a sort of a moral compass with which to judge your own behavior and to operate in a world where many people are not. But it's working on you as you are working with those ideas and hopefully making you better as you go.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eHOLIDAY [ONLINE POST]: You're going to die. You could die tomorrow, you could die the day after tomorrow, but it is a certainty you are going to die. You could leave life right now. Marcus Aurelius says, let that determine what you do and say and think. \u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI:\u003cem\u003e That last bit there was from one of Ryan Holiday's online posts. Holiday is a best selling author of books such as The Daily Stoic, The Obstacle is the Way, Discipline is Destiny, Courage is Calling, and The Lives of the Stoics.\u003c/em\u003e","So what is it about this ancient Greco-Roman practice that is finding so many followers today? I have to say, when we said we were going to do a show about stoicism, we heard from a whole heck of a lot of you. So joining me now in the studio is Margaret Graver. She's a professor of classics at Dartmouth College and author of Seneca: The Literary Philosopher, amongst other books.","Professor Graver, welcome to you.","MARGARET GRAVER: Hi.","CHAKRABARTI: Also with us today is Nancy Sherman. She's a philosophy professor at Georgetown University and author of Stoic Wisdom: Ancient Lessons from Modern Resilience, and Afterwar: Healing the Moral Wounds of Our Soldiers. Professor Sherman, welcome to you.","NANCY SHERMAN: Hi. Nice to be here, Meghna.","CHAKRABARTI: It's great to have you both with us because I have been captivated by how often I see amongst, for example, some of the YouTubers I follow, that they are quite dedicated to this idea of stoicism. And Professor Graver, let's start with a little bit of the history. Because we mentioned some names, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, et cetera.","How far back in time and where would we go to first pinpoint the rise or the flourishing of stoicism?","GRAVER: Sure, Meghna. So what we're talking about is a system of philosophy that originated in Athens in the 3rd century BCE. We speak of the Stoics rather than of any single name. Because there were really three founders of ancient stoicism.","Interestingly, none of them was an Athenian. So Zeno of Citium was from Cyprus. His pupil, Cleanthes of Assos, was from Asia Minor, what we think of as Turkey. And then the third and maybe the most brilliant of these three powerful thinkers was Chrysippus of Soli, also from Asia Minor. Then those three, although they did write voluminously, we only have snippets of their work.","Most of what we can read now of stoicism was from later authors, from the Roman, Cicero, was not a Stoic, but was very knowledgeable about stoicism, wrote a lot about it. And then especially the figures that Ryan Holiday mentioned, Seneca, a century later than Cicero, Epictetus, several generations later, and then Marcus Aurelius in the third century.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So we're going to talk about all of them more in just a moment, but let's jump back and forth here, while we learn about the ancient history. So Professor Sherman. You heard Ryan Holiday say that that he thinks the human experience now, in a certain sense, it does reflect the human experience that gave rise to stoicism in Ancient Greek and then flourishing in Ancient Rome.","What's your take on that?","SHERMAN: Certainly. Thanks very much. First of all. We certainly feel that we're in cataclysmic times with climate change, wars, partisan divides of the like that we've never seen. And, of course, the huge equity differences, income differences that create the resentments and the grievances and the sense of not getting the work you want and the like, so I think there's certainly some resonating with it. That said, a lot of the people that initially got interested didn't have those problems. That is by initially, the popular appeal, they were tech bros who felt that they had to dream big and contain their egos a bit as they dreamt big.","That's how Tim Ferriss once put it, the author of Four Day Week, that it was a way to monitor yourself a little bit. If your dreams got a bit too grandiose. And I think that still is some of it, but there's definitely the idea of wanting to have a religion that's secular. Where it doesn't require tithing, belonging to this synagogue, mosque, church, and all the buy up that comes with it.","In this case, you just tune in to your favorite podcasts, read a little bit of Seneca in the morning, or Marcus Aurelius in the morning.","\u003cstrong\u003ePart II\u003c/strong\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: As I said a little earlier, when we told you On Point listeners last week that we were going to do this show, we heard from a ton of folks.","So for example, here's Sophie Magon in Michigan.","\u003cem\u003eSOPHIE MAGON: A lot of times now the younger generation has unlimited access to news and horrifying things all the time. And so learning how to process those things in a way that doesn't affect your mental health in such a negative way, like turning on the internet and seeing all these deaths and things and just being able to process them and appreciate them and feel them, but not have it overtake your life.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eI feel like it's a really strong point of stoicism nowadays.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: So that's Sophie in Michigan, and this is Nick Forbes, who called us from Salt Lake City, Utah, and he shared with us how his parents were divorced when he was very young. He found himself struggling with his Mormon religion. After that, he fell into drugs and alcohol in college.","\u003cem\u003eNICK FORBES: And then the founding principles behind stoicism encourage self-control, and that really helped me in my journey of sobriety. And in a world where everyone is striving to be identical to each other, be different. That's the main takeaway that I got was, you know what, you are different, and that's okay.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eThat's an incredibly uplifting thing.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: That's Nick from Salt Lake City, Utah. I'm joined today by Nancy Sherman and Margaret Graver. And Professor Graver, like I said, I want to bounce back and forth between the ancients and today. And you hear in those calls, and also in how I even introduced the show, this idea that stoicism is about self-control, self-moderation.","Is that how the ancient Greeks that you had mentioned first thought about and wrote about stoicism, or was it completely different in the Greek context?","GRAVER: I wouldn't say completely different. I would say that the practices you speak of and the strategies for gaining control of your life were a part of ancient stoicism.","But it's important to realize for someone like me, that we are talking about a philosophy here. Whether these are thinkers who are deeply analytical, and the ethical orientation that we hear so much about from Ryan Holiday and others, was only one branch element of a system that also included, for starters, logic.","These are the people who invented propositional logic. Cosmology and physics, that's their terminology. We would say, perhaps natural science. So you have Greek philosophers, as many people know, who talked about atoms and void. That's not the Stoic approach. They're much more interested in energy, movement, events, which they sum up in a concept of what they call designing fire. The energy that pervades the universe and gives rise to all events. These people are also fatalists. And then that also involves a theology. The designing fire is, hello, also God, a philosophical theology here.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, I was going to say, it's a philosophical thought, it's not necessarily a religious one.","GRAVER: The comparisons to religion, they are helpful in a way but then there is this thought through as part of a philosophical system.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so actually the idea of that designing fire or being concerned with the energy that makes the universe actually seems very scientific to me. Energy being the only thing that cannot be created or destroyed, mostly, of all the factors that we know that make up the universe.","But was the development, centuries long development of stoicism, in response to something in ancient Greece or not? Was it just one of the ways in which the Greeks were thinking about and exploring the world?","GRAVER: It's probably helpful to think about stoicism in response to its not so very distant predecessors, Plato and Aristotle, but were both very important predecessors for stoicism and a tradition that goes back to Socrates of what is now called virtue ethics.","Stoics take up those strands that you find in Plato's depictions of Socrates, for instance, and make it into a tighter and more coherent and rigorous system, grounded in the idea that the human being is essentially a rational creature. Not to say that we always behave sensibly, but that our feelings and our behaviors arise from our beliefs.","Beliefs about value and beliefs about the world, and that we can self-correct. So if we are shown that we are mistaken about something, we have the impulse to correct our thinking. When we change our beliefs, we also change the way we feel about things and also the way that we act.","And that's just a design feature of the human species, so I spoke of designing fire, you have a providential deity who is designing the world, and this is how we, the kind of creature we are, is designed.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay.","GRAVER: Central fact about us.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, quick question, and then, and Professor Sherman, I promise I'll come back to you. When speaking, when focusing so much about a particular way of thinking, I sometimes find on this show that I get, I forget about the broader context. So just to place stoicism in the overall expanse of Greek thought, was it practiced by a lot of Greeks? Was it a fringe thing? How can we understand its influence on ancient Greek society?","GRAVER: To the extent that ancient Greek society did have intellectual activity, discussion, and philosophy as an important part of it, I'm not saying for everyone, but for people who could read, that portion of the population that could read, or had the luxury of doing this, would have been seen, was seen as a dominant philosophy for approximately five centuries, from the third century right through to the second century CE and beyond.","So these were the primary inheritors of the tradition of Plato and Aristotle.","CHAKRABARTI: I see. Okay. Fascinating. So Professor Sherman now let's move a little bit into the Roman period. The Romans did adopt a lot of what the Greeks created. But how do you see stoicism playing out amongst or playing out in ancient Rome?","SHERMAN: So let me just speak to that and also back up a tiny bit. They are. Very much, historics are very much practicing a philosophy that had deeper roots. As Margaret mentioned, Margaret Graver mentioned the Socratic background and Platonic background, but also Aristotle. And one of the critical pieces that Aristotle lays down is not just that we're rational animals, but our self-sufficiency is relational.","It's not alone that we survive and thrive and flourish. It's with each other in families and cities and in the greater community. And that often gets missed, even in the Roman practice, where it is very much about calming yourself, as Holiday said, at the end of the day, and it's yourself.","It's seeing how you can improve, how you can progress, yes, with virtue and virtue ethics, but very much a sort of a self-optimization, you might say. But that misses another strand that really was dominant in Aristotle, and there are strands of it even in the Roman Stoics. Marcus, who's writing his Meditations on the Battlefield, eight years of horrific, of campaigning along the Danube where he's probably sick with the Antonine Plague.","And he says, if you've ever seen a hand or a foot or a leg severed off from the rest of the trunk, that's what we make of ourselves when we cut ourselves off from each other. And they have this idea that we're in a commonwealth.","... The idea is you're a citizen of the universe, a citizen of the world, and you are connected, and so that would have been a part of Roman practice as well, but it's meshed with the idea that you are a self-critic, bring yourself, you know, before the court of opinion, in a sense, at the end of the day, Seneca says when it's quiet, his wife is asleep.","He's thinking about his failures during the day. And I often think it's very much a bit of self-flagellation or castigation. It's not very common to go through a litany of failures. But it is very much about how you improve. But there's also this sense, as I say, this strand, you see it in this quote from Marcus on the battlefield, he must have been thinking of a cadre and how we need each other to fight.","But also, Heracles, a lesser-known Roman during the Roman period, says, imagine a person at the center, and then all the concentric circles outwards. Your job is to zealously transfer the outer circle into the inner. To connect. And you can only zealously transfer if you have a sort of imagination that helps you appreciate the sense of the other in your own world.","And so I think that often gets missed in the worry about the upheavals of our personal lives.","CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Can I just jump in here?","SHERMAN: Stabilize.","CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Can I just jump in here for a quick second? Because Marcus Aurelius in particular fascinates me from the little I know about him. And in total transparency here, whenever I hear the name of that famed ancient Roman, honestly, the movie Gladiator is the first thing that comes to mind. When Russell Crowe's character of Maximus goes into the tent during one of the great wars that you were talking about, Professor Sherman, and there is Richard Harris's Marcus Aurelius just writing as this devastation is going on around him.","But as I said at the top of the show, and I'll ask both of you this, he was an emperor of Rome. If there was anyone who had power to make change in the environment around him, it was someone like that. But yet he is one of the most famed philosophers or at least writers of stoicism, which, I'm just looking at some quotes from him online.","'External things are not the problem. It's your assessment of them, which you can erase right now.' And then he says, 'Think of the life you have lived until now as over and as a dead man, see what's left as a bonus and live it according to nature.' Can you tell me a little bit more about Marcus Aurelius and his relationship or why he was Such a stoic?","SHERMAN: This would have been his philosophy. It was taught then, and he viewed Epictetus as an inspiration of sorts, an enslaved person. Epictetus, we know, was enslaved around the time of Nero. But learned philosophy and started lecturing on it and had pithy witticisms that would appeal then and appeal now to the public and Marcus presumably came across them.","There's also the sense, he's got to be able to make it in 8 years of horrific war. He is presumably very sick. The fact that he commands enormous power doesn't mean that he's not aware of the dangers of the power. And also, how he is beholden to others for his success, whether or not he thanks in the acknowledgments to his book, you might say, at the beginning of the book or the end.","We probably think it wasn't where it appears in the beginning, but he thanks his grandmother. He thanks his mother. And he thanks, my favorite is the grammarian who wasn't, who didn't get angry at his howlers, when he misspoke. So he has a sense of humility. And I think he's trying to practice humility, despite his power and the abuses of power.","And of course, the dangers of death out there, he's dying, and he's got to make it back to Rome, and his brothers died. So these are hard times. There's no doubt that he needs to toughen it up a bit.","CHAKRABARTI: Let me, the idea of the Marcus rule is needing to tough it up. It really sticks with me. But Professor Graver, I know you want to jump. You want to jump in here.","GRAVER: Just to say that anyone who has ever held a leadership position knows that things don't always go the way you want them to. Marcus, as a leader, amazing leader of a world community, is in the same position. You can try, but you're not guaranteed of success. That person needs a coping strategy, just as much as anyone else, maybe even more.","I want to go back to something that Nancy emphasized, and I would also emphasize, which is the social dimension of stoicism. I had stressed that the human being is by design and inherently and essentially a rational creature. By the same token, a social creature. Even when we're babies or very young children, love to figure things out for themselves.","That's the rational nature beginning to manifest itself. But also, even a baby smiles at their caregiver more than at some random person. That's the beginnings of community right there. So Marcus, as a leader of the community, has a responsibility grounded in that design feature of the human, to work for the beautiful community.","It's not just the good self. It's the good community or the ideal community that one is striving to achieve. That's the responsibility, and that is pursued vigorously, energetically, at the same time, recognizing that not everything we try to achieve is going to be achieved.","CHAKRABARTI: That is such a good point, because, again, to emphasize that the responsibility to community was a overt and active part of stoic practice, right?","And it just gets me thinking to what Ryan Holiday said earlier, that maybe that's not the first thing these days that pulls folks into learning about stoicism, right? It's the effect on the self. He insists though, that it can be then, to use a terrible ancient pun. That could be the Trojan horse. (LAUGHS)","I'm sorry, I couldn't resist! That then gets people to think about society a little bit more. Oh my god, they're going to take me off the air right now for terrible ancient puns. But you know what? We have to we have to take a quick break here. When we come back, I want to, again, place us firmly into how this ancient philosophy is really finding a lot of resonance with people today.","\u003cstrong\u003ePart III\u003c/strong\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: I want to just continue to reflect the resonance that Stoicism had amongst or has amongst many of our own listeners.","This is Diane Allison from Spokane, Washington.","\u003cem\u003eDIANE ALLISON: I practice the stoic principle of the fact that I have control over my mind, but not outside events. By, oh, you can control how you feel about others. You can control how you treat others. And I guess that's stoical, instead of complaining that people are all evil and unpleasant, you conclude that people are pretty nice and they do treat you pretty nice when you treat them nicely.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: And here's Christian Boyd from Waukesha, Wisconsin, who says he's a quasi-practicing Stoic. He's a Presbyterian clergy person and says despite what people think, Christianity and Stoicism can exist together.","\u003cem\u003eCHRISTIAN BOYD: And I think a lot of people may be turning to Stoicism today because it is, it doesn't have as much cultural baggage to it, especially in the American context where religion has become overwhelmingly heavy and divisive.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eSo stoicism seems to be a lot cleaner, philosophical approach to organizing your life.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so there's Christian Boyd saying Christianity and stoicism can exist together. On the other hand, Joel Karen from Salt Lake City, Utah, he grew up in the Mormon church and eventually decided to leave his faith.","\u003cem\u003eJOEL KAREN: Stoicism encourages me to be the person I had hoped to be as a Christian. But without the all-seeing eye of God threatening to punish me if I disobey his word. As a practicing Stoic, I get to be honest, kind, ethical, moral, helpful, benevolent, and all those things. Because I choose to, not because God commanded me to. \u003c/em\u003eStoicism works for me very well. I'm a much better person outside of religion as a stoic than I ever was inside religion as a believer.","CHAKRABARTI: So a couple of On Point listeners there reflecting what you Professor Sherman had said earlier about it's not just a way of being, but a system of belief that seems to be really attractive to a lot of Americans now.","With that thought in mind, I'd like to introduce you to one more. This fellow.","\u003cem\u003eRYAN MULKOWSKY: My name is Ryan Mulkowsky. I live just outside of Atlanta, Georgia. And currently I work as a hospice chaplain and bereavement coordinator, and I also work as a mental health therapist.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Back in 2021, Ryan wrote a blog post whose title was Stoicism Saved My Life, and we wanted to know more.","\u003cem\u003eMULKOWSKY: I was raised fairly religious, Christian. Very conservative evangelical for a long time, and I was actually conservative evangelical pastor for a long time and then started just moving through the world and started interacting with people. I was kept in a very in a small bubble and didn't really have a lot of friends that thought differently than me or look differently than me or anything like that.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd when I became an adult and I started exploring what did life look like outside of my little bubble? It created a lot of questions and questions created a lot of doubts for me. And for me, it was a really slow process. It wasn't like overnight, I decided, okay, I'm not going to be a Christian anymore.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Ryan had been questioning his faith for years, but he says it wasn't until about 2019 that he decided he needed to move on from Christianity.","\u003cem\u003e MULKOWSKY: Leaving that behind and everything that went with that. Was just really hard, I wasn't just leaving a job. I was leaving a community. I was leaving friends.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eMy entire academic career was built on that. So when I left that, it was, I felt completely lost. And didn't know what I was going to do with my life and I came across stoicism also, in part, because I got therapy and as my therapist was working with me, supporting me and trying to find, discover for myself, how am I going to change\u003c/em\u003e?","How am I going to move through these situations? I realized that cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a very popular form of therapy, actually has its roots in stoic philosophy.","CHAKRABARTI: And then the pandemic hit. Ryan worked in hospice and found those years to be incredibly trying. He says it was during the pandemic when he really leaned into Stoicism as a guiding philosophy for his daily life.","Now, a few years on, he says he's lucky that his parents and in laws continue to love and support him, even if not totally understanding why he left Christianity. He says he still remembers the night when he told his wife.","\u003cem\u003e MULKOWSKY: It was a hard conversation. We talked for hours that night. I still remember it to this day, sitting in the living room.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eI remember exactly where I sat, where she sat. I remember what was shared. I remember the tears in her eyes. I remember the tears in my eyes. It was a very difficult conversation. We talked for hours that night after the kids were asleep and everything. But she was so supportive. She just came up and gave me a hug and a kiss and she said, I love you no matter what.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd we'll navigate what is it like for me to have a faith and you not to have a faith? And what does that look like for our kids? We don't have to figure that out today. It was just her showing her love and devotion to me, meant the world to me.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: That's Ryan Mulkowsky. He's a hospice chaplain, bereavement coordinator, and mental health therapist just outside of Atlanta, Georgia.","And Professor Graver, we wanted to actually feature a lot of those voices because many people, when they called us, they talked about either trying to find a way for Stoicism to fit into their current system of belief, most of the voices you heard there were Christian, or as Professor Sherman said, it seemed to be a better way of being than their current organized religion.","Why do you think that might be?","GRAVER: I think I'm not eager to talk about comparisons of stoicism with religious systems. I think we might want to go back to what I see as the core of pretty much everyone you've heard from, which is the idea of having a coping strategy for difficult modern world with a lot of stuff coming at us all at once.","The idea of being able to claim the self, and in particular to gain some measure of control over our emotional responses. So this is indeed part of ancient stoicism. I stressed earlier in the show that the core of ancient stoic ethics is about the essentially rational nature of the human being, but that doesn't mean that we always behave in a sensible way, far from it.","What it does mean is that both our behaviors and our feelings arise from things that we believe and the ways that we reason and put together our beliefs. It's important that the emotional response is also very carefully analyzed in the ancient texts. Emotions, the way you feel, the boiling up of anger, the clutch of fear, these things are also behaviors.","And arise from our rational mind in the same way as our actions and beliefs do. It's true that they don't always feel like something that is under our control. Chrysippus had the wonderful analogy to a runner heading downhill. In the moment when you're running, you can't necessarily stop. But it doesn't mean that running is not something that you chose to do.","So we need to give ourselves a little time in the moment of strong emotion. But afterwards, with some discussion, some reading, some working with other people, we can rethink those beliefs that are grounding our emotions and the values in particular. And make a difference for ourselves going forward.","CHAKRABARTI: For the way both of you described what the practice of stoicism allows a person to do, in a sense I really feel for a lot of the callers who said, I was a lifelong Christian, but there wasn't, something wasn't working for me. Because, as actually one of our listeners said, it's still a religion that externalizes a powerful deity, right?","And your practice is in trying to be in line with that external deity, but I think they found much more promise in the sort of, like you said, the internal practice of changing oneself. Now, that brings me to a point which I've been dying to get to, all throughout this conversation. We're really focused on the Greeks and Romans, because we're talking about Stoicism, but every single thing both of you have described sounds like it actually has an even more ancient history to me, and I'm thinking of ancient eastern philosophies, particularly Buddhism, if you ask me.","But we did get a caller, we got a caller who pointed out exactly this. This is Zubin Billimoria from Los Angeles.","\u003cem\u003eZUBIN BILLIMORIA: When one focuses internally on oneself and one's own internal development and searching for the purpose in life, it automatically ends up that the external world surroundings around you, immediate surroundings around you, would not matter as much and you stay dissociated from the life around you.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eTaking it just as it is, watching it like a movie and saying, this is what this is, and there is nothing that I could have done that would have changed this moment. And if there was, I learned a lesson from it and move on. I don't think, honestly, there's anything new that stoicism has brought to the table, unless one could say that it was probably an idea that has now been repackaged by westerners, for the Western world. And that's what makes it suddenly seem so much more interesting.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Professor Sherman that holds a lot of sway with me. My father used to always say that one of the goals was to free yourself from attachment. And that didn't mean necessarily mean go live in a cave, but that free yourself from attachment so that you can actually operate in complete, being completely present in the world.","And that came from his Buddhist practice. What do you think about that?","SHERMAN: Oh, there's certainly overlaps, whatever the cross fertilization was in the ancient world. Stoics are certainly interested, as Margaret was saying, in retraining your emotions so that you don't have the same sticky acquisitive approach mechanisms or panicky aversion avoidance mechanism.","So you're trying to let go a little bit of the unruly passions, and train more, train calmer ones, but there are a few critical differences. I've practiced Buddhist meditation in my life, and there's a sense in which you really empty your mind and try to quiet it. And that's part of the idea of the selflessness.","And as you read the meditative practices of the ancients, they really were into, if not God punishing you, the self punishes. Seneca can be quite hard on himself. At the end of the day, you are the judge before yourself. What'd you do wrong? Did you scream at someone? Did you think you should be sitting at the dais when they put you in the back of the room at a sub table? Yeah. And I do remember this when Carl Reiner died his good friend Steve Martin, just prior to that, his good friend Steve Martin said am I, is it too late? He said, no, I'm just up here, going through my litany of failures.","It's that sort of self-examination that can be overly critical. And so there's a sense in which the self's improvement is really what the ancient world has always been about. And the idea of letting go of the ego is a much more eastern notion, even though there's definitely similarities, and permanence is a Buddhist notion.","Whereas the stoics think less about impermanence and more about, Have you done everything you can? And then it's time to let go.","CHAKRABARTI: Those are important distinctions. I see what you're talking about here. And I just want to give Professor Graver a chance to jump in.","GRAVER: I would echo some of that.","It's certainly true that there are some commonalities with Buddhist practice. The idea of self-knowledge, the idea of rethinking your desires, the idea of correcting your own attitudes, but also this Buddhist ideal of tranquility. And of having an ideal version of human existence to aspire to.","These things are also part of ancient Stoicism. Maybe not from coming from the same place, but getting to a place that for many people today will feel quite similar. And I think I would just add that for ancient Stoics, and maybe also for some modern Stoics, that this is experienced as liberation. As a kind of freedom.","SHERMAN: It is a freedom. Can I just add one thing?","CHAKRABARTI: Yes. Yeah. And then I have one last quick question. But we only have a minute now. You got 10 seconds and I'm going to give you that last question.","SHERMAN: Equanimity. Yes. But one thing that's often missing in these accounts is changing the social structure and not just your attitude to it.","And that I find really problematic, even ancient and modern. Social structure matters.","CHAKRABARTI: So I want to sneak this last one in here. We've just got under 60 seconds left. But what, one of the things that fascinates me about this is not some, is not just how many Americans these days are finding stoicism attractive, but all the principles both of you talked about are actually the opposite of what we teach young children today in school.","You're laughing because, right? It's true. Like the centrality of feeling, like being safe in all circumstances. About if you're hurt, it doesn't matter what the intention of the other person was about the facts are feelings. This is a completely different way of thinking. Professor Sherman, I'm going to give you the last 10 seconds here.","Should we be teaching stoicism in schools instead?","SHERMAN: I don't actually think so. I actually think being able to feel is critically important and not just changing how you feel and reducing the impact of others. I would say having resilience, he thought of as a social structure. And so that idea of Marcus, if you see yourself cut off from others, that's what we make of ourselves.","And we cut ourselves off from the community, having a supportive community. And the ways in which we support through understanding is really the way to strengthen. And I think that's an enlightened view of Stoicism that we need to teach our children, if through the Stoic texts or not."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101035332/why-the-ancient-stoic-philosophy-is-making-a-comeback-how-to-sit-better","title":"Why the ancient Stoic philosophy is making a comeback; How to sit better : Here \u0026 Now Anytime","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2020/08/27/906607702/the-socrates-express-takes-readers-on-a-ride-through-applied-philosophy","title":"'The Socrates Express' Takes Readers On A Ride Through Applied Philosophy","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/12/1224196441/instead-of-chasing-happiness-build-deeper-meaning-into-your-life","title":"Instead of chasing happiness, build deeper meaning into your life","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2022/09/13/1122796534/rituals-are-important-to-human-life-even-when-they-seem-meaningless","title":"Rituals are important to human life â even when they seem meaningless","prefix":""}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"full","broadcastDate":"2024-05-28 10:00:00","broadcastTime":"10:00:00","itunesEpType":"full","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesSeason":0,"itunesTitle":"Why the ancient philosophy of stoicism is having a modern revival","itunesSummary":"The Greco-Roman philosophy of stoicism is having a moment.

That's until a colleague recently sent a photo of a rare species of wild garlic to Grace Glynn, a botanist with the Fish and Wildlife Department.","\"When I opened up the photo that she had sent, there was this little weird plant in the corner of the frame. And when I zoomed in, I immediately knew that it was\u003cem\u003e Floerkea,\u003c/em\u003e that it was false mermaid-weed,\" Glynn said. \"I couldn't believe that I was finally seeing this plant.\"","Glynn said she’s been looking for the plant for years, to no avail. It hasn’t been spotted in any of the handful of areas where it had historically been identified and collected.","\u003cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","The new population spans both public and private land along a slow-moving river in Addison County — a completely separate river from where the plant had previously been recorded.","Glynn said the newly discovered population may comprise of thousands of the plants. When she went to survey the area, she found them amid stands of ostrich ferns and the rare wild garlic species that helped lead to the finding.","Because the plant is a spring ephemeral, this discovery couldn't have come at a more opportune time.","\"The thing about \u003cem\u003eFloerkea\u003c/em\u003e, or false mermaid-weed, is that it's only visible for about four to six weeks every year,” Glynn said. “So if you're out in the place at the wrong time of year, you could just walk by it, and there would be nothing there. It would just be seeds on the ground.\"","The plant is unique because not only is it a spring ephemeral, but it’s also an annual. This means it carries out a full life cycle — germination, flowering, setting seed and dying — all in one season. Glynn said the plant makes very small, delicate blossoms and drops spiky, football-shaped seeds.","“If you crouch down in the floodplain right now, you'll notice that the ground is just carpeted with these little spiky fruits. And it was so cool to see that. You know, I've never seen that in Vermont,” Glynn said.","It’s also the only species of the family \u003cem\u003eLimnanthaceae\u003c/em\u003e, or meadowfoam, in the Northeast.","According to Glynn, the last botanist to record the plant in Vermont was Nellie Flynn, who contributed to the Pringle Herbarium at the University of Vermont.","“It was just amazing to touch this plant and to think, ‘Oh, Nellie Flynn was probably the last person to ever touch this species in Vermont back in 1916,’\" Glynn said. “And I always think about how there are just these threads through history that kind of tie you to other botanists, and it just adds depth and richness, I think, to an already rich story.”","Glynn said the amount of plants in the area indicates that there could be more populations of the species downstream. She plans to survey more areas, but some of that might have to wait for next year — the plant only blooms for about a month before withering away.","____","\u003cem\u003eThis story is a production of the New England News Collaborative.

You're about to hear a scene from an excellent series of reports by Conrad Wilson of Oregon Public Broadcasting. He spent a lot of time with first responders to witness firsthand the impact of Oregon's fentanyl crisis.","The state has the worst drug addiction rate in the country. And a warning. In this 92 second clip, there is a graphic description of a drug overdose death.","\u003cem\u003eCONRAD WILSON: The call crackled in over Portland Police Sergeant Jerry Cioeta's radio. It was two by cops under his command in Old Town. Someone had overdosed a few blocks away.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003ePOLICE: We deployed Narcan twice now.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eWILSON: About one minute later, Cioeta was on the scene. In one fluid motion, he pressed his foot on the brake, put his police cruiser into park and unbuckled. Pausing for a beat to look out the passenger side window to see what he was getting into, and then whispered under his breath, he's dead. There, was a young man splayed out on the red brick sidewalk in the middle of the afternoon.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eEven from across the street, it was clear the pink and red had drained from his skin. In their place, a lifeless white face and light blue lips. Down the block, a light rail train rang its bell as Cioeta sped across the tracks towards his officers, the ones who had already given the man two doses of the overdose reversal drug Narcan, they were still trying to save the man's life.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003ePOLICE #1: Boss, how much more Narcan do you have? \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003ePOLICE #2: A lot more.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003ePOLICE #1: Fine. Boom. \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eWILSON: Cioeta got down on one knee, held the man on his side and sprayed a third dose up his nose. \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003ePOLICE: Hey, don't die on us. Come on. Come back. There we go. Come on. Come on. Wakey, wakey. \u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eWILSON: This moment, playing out on a Portland sidewalk where life or death is up for grabs, has become routine.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: And that awful moment, reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson. He's been doing really tremendous long-term reporting on Oregon's drug abuse crisis and the state's attempts to do something about it. And this particular story appeared in an episode of OPB's podcast, The Evergreen, back in February.","And that moment also contains the powerful reason and motivation that led Oregon voters to pass a historic referendum, three and a half years ago.","\u003cem\u003eNEWS BRIEF: Oregon is now the first state to decriminalize small amounts of hard drugs. We're talking things like heroin, cocaine, and meth.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: November 3, 2020, voters passed Measure 110, the “Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act,” with 58% of the vote. The measure decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs. And instead of jail time, people faced a maximum fine of $100. And more importantly, Measure 110 aimed to help people into treatment and recovery by massively expanding Oregon’s treatment and outreach centers.","Three and a half years later, the state’s drug addiction epidemic has only gotten worse. Some 10% of Oregonians struggle with substance abuse. Here’s Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler this past September.","\u003cem\u003eTED WHEELER: Just by virtue  of illustrating how important this issue is. The last time I saw somebody consuming what I believe to be fentanyl publicly on our streets was less than five minutes ago, three blocks from City Hall.\u003c/em\u003e","AKRABARTI: As a consequence, Oregonians, like State Representative Christine Goodwin, have soured on Measure 110.","\u003cem\u003eCHRISTINE GOODWIN: Oregonians have been clear. They are ready for this misguided decriminalization experiment to be over.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Last month, the Oregon state legislature ended the state’s historic decriminalization experiment. Passed with bipartisan support, and signed by Democratic Governor Tina Kotek, House Bill 4002 recriminalizes possession of small amounts of hard drugs. It also includes provisions to offer people a chance to enter treatment after an “encounter” with a police officer.","Some call it a complete rollback of Measure 110. Others say it’s a much needed reform.","What can the rest of the country learn from Oregon’s experience?","We are joined today by Alex Kral. An epidemiologist with the independent nonprofit research institute RTI International.","He's leading a four-year evaluation of Oregon’s Measure 110. He joins us from San Francisco, California. Welcome Alex to On Point.","ALEX KRAL: Pleased to be with you today.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so let's first start off with an understanding of the greater context of the situation in Oregon at the time of Measure 110's passing.","So this is November of 2020. Obviously, we have the pandemic. So how would you describe the pandemic's effect in setting the greater context for Oregon's attempts here?","KRAL: Yes, there were a lot of things that were going on at the time. This is [2021], right? If we're going back to this time, 2021, if we go back to this time capsule the pandemic had a lot of different impacts, both on people's housing and ability to live where they could live, people are isolating. And then one of the biggest pieces that's really relevant to M110 is policing and also the legal system.","And so the legal system really had a buildup of cases and a limited ability to move people through a legal system, as well.","CHAKRABARTI: Explain that a little more about the buildup of cases.","KRAL: Yeah, and so because we had to isolate in place, you couldn't have large courtrooms.","You couldn't have a lot of the kinds of things that you would need to for legal cases to be tried. And there's people who, people are not working as much as they were working before, either. There was a lot of different things that impacted whether you could actually bring cases through court systems.","CHAKRABARTI: I see. Okay. So you're saying that the entire justice system at the state slowed down because of COVID. That's very, that's understandable. I think we saw that in other places too. Now you said 2021, because the measure went into effect February 2021, just for clarity there. The other thing that happened, as far as I can understand, we started with that very sad and disturbing moment of a fentanyl overdose death in Portland, but fentanyl, the availability of it, really rose in Oregon in 2020.","Can you tell me about that?","KRAL: Yes. That clip is really disturbing. That CDC just released figures a couple of weeks ago. For 2023, and there were again over 100,000 deaths, overdose deaths in the United States. This is something that's been on the rise for two decades, but particularly for the last decade.","And the reason why it's been on the rise has been because of the entry of fentanyl into the unregulated drug markets. Now the thing that's important to note there is that fentanyl entered the drug markets on the East coast about 10 years ago. But didn't enter the drug markets on the West coast until around 2019 or 2020.","And Oregon is not unique among West Coast states, in terms of rising overdose deaths due to fentanyl. But it is unique compared to what was going on the East Coast, because that really started a few years earlier.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So good point. And actually, I appreciate you saying that basically COVID and fentanyl, these are common challenges.","Catastrophes really, that not just Oregon, but neighboring states also experienced at the time. So in a sense, from a research point of view, that gives you a really clear comparison between what happened in a state that experimented with decriminalization and what happened in a state that did not. Yes?","KRAL: Yeah. In order to evaluate anything that happened with M110, you have to compare Oregon to other states, and the question that becomes the difficult evaluation and research question is, what are the states that are relevant to actually provide us controls? And if you're looking at overdoses, that's just very clear.","It would need to be states that are west of the Rocky Mountains. And if you compare Oregon to Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, those are the appropriate places. And if you look at overdose deaths during the time 2021 to 2023, what happened in Oregon is exactly the same rates, the exact same increases as happened in the neighboring states.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, but quick clarification here, did not Washington state and correct me if I'm wrong, but pass a sort of partial decriminalization around the same time.","KRAL: Yeah, Washington had a partial decriminalization for almost a year in there as well. And so if we don't compare it to Washington, if we just compare Oregon to California, Nevada and Idaho, it's the exact same rates.","What's interesting is that if you actually look at the Washington rates during the time they've now recriminalized just like Oregon is about to do, for a couple of years. And rates have continued to go up in Washington, as well. And really whether you decriminalize or not, the data are very clear.","That in these Western states, overdose deaths have been skyrocketing since the advent of fentanyl coming into the drug market supply, which just so happened to be around the same time that M110 was enacted.","CHAKRABARTI: It just sounds like there's so many terrible confounding factors that come into play that very year, 2020, 2021.","Overdose deaths cannot be a good measure of Measure 110 success or failure. Point well taken there. What then would you look to, to assess whether in the three and a half years that it was given, whether Oregon's attempt to decriminalize, small possession of small amounts of hard drugs worked or not?","KRAL: Yeah, I wouldn't say that we can't use overdose as a benchmark. We can, right? It's just what we're finding so far is that M110 hasn't had an impact on overdose deaths in Oregon when you compare it to other states. It could have gotten worse or it could have gotten better. And it would have been fine to do that as long as we're always comparing it, right?","And so if you're in Oregon and only looking and thinking about Oregon, you're going to say, Oh, my God, these overdose deaths have gone up. Why is it? It must be because of M110 or something similar. But if you talk to people in California, they're saying the exact same things. It's the same in Washington, right?","And so they all happen at the same time. But I think the other piece that's a contextual piece that's really important beyond the entry of fentanyl into drug system is really what's a housing crisis, and that's also on the West Coast.","\u003cstrong\u003ePart II\u003c/strong\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: I'd like to now introduce into the show Tera Hurst. She's joining us from Portland, Oregon. She's an epidemiologist. Executive Director for the Health Justice Recovery Alliance, and her organization is dedicated to the implementation of Measure 110.","Tera Hurst, welcome to On Point.","TERA HURST: Thank you so much for having me.","CHAKRABARTI: So as you heard Alex say, in terms of the reduction of overdose deaths, excuse me, Measure 110 really can't be looked at as a factor of, in terms of the increase, or ideally we would have had a decrease, but we didn't. It had no impact on that.","But what the measure did promise essentially was along with decriminalization of possession. The idea was that would allow the state and law enforcement and most importantly treatment and recovery centers to expand addiction services and social supports through some very important redirected state funds, which we'll talk about in a second.","And that would get a lot more people into treatment and recovery than was ever available before in Oregon. Did that happen?","HURST: It did happen. Measure 110 wasn't given enough time, and it wasn't fully implemented as it was intended to be. You had mentioned that we had the high, we have the highest addiction rates.","We also have the lowest access to care in the country. Oregon was really walking into multiple crisis as we've talked, as you've talked about before, including the one that I think is missing in that list is also the wildfires that destroyed entire towns in our state which left even more of a housing, but also a behavioral health crisis.","So the voters wanted things to change and unfortunately the law was not set up for success. A lot of that is due to all of the once in a generation scale of crises that we were facing. The state didn't get the services money out the door quickly. It took, it was at about a 18-month lag.","But I think what's really important for listeners to know is that once that money got out the door, people were receiving help. Immediately. And it took time. We have a behavioral health workforce crisis, which the entire country is facing. So hiring, buying buildings, getting houses, Measure 110 was really about funding the services that Medicaid doesn't cover, so that people don't fall through the cracks.","It covered peer support and outreach services, housing and permanent housing, but also transitional housing and emergency housing, so that if we didn't have a treatment bed available, at least we could get somebody off the streets and under a roof and safe.","CHAKRABARTI: Can you help me understand something then?","Because something's not clear to me. We'll talk about the money not getting out of the door in a timely manner, because that's a really important factor here, the implementation. But in terms of expanded services, you're exactly right. I don't think the point can be made enough that Oregon had basically the worst availability of services prior to Measure 110 passing, but I was looking at an Oregon, an OHA and Oregon health.","I think it's the health association.","HURST: Authority.","CHAKRABARTI: Sorry, I was looking at an OHA data report, which was part of what the requirements were for Measure 110, and it was for the fifth quarter after Measure 110 had passed. And this data report showed that, or at least reported that the treatment partners who were key to the expansion of services across the state, that in that fifth quarter, only 35% of them had said they had expanded services or increased the number of clients served, which is a little different than you saying there was this massive expansion.","HURST: I think it's important to look at treatment in a more holistic perspective. Sometimes we have this vision that treatment is just a 20-day, 28-day program. You go inpatient and then you come out and you're in recovery and you're going to meetings. And ultimately, the best evidence, it shows that there are multiple stages, and that's what Measure 110 really tried to get its arms around, in terms of the funding.","So it looked at, we know that with harm reduction, the Center for Disease Control says that you're five times more likely to enter into treatment and recovery if you are working with someone through harm reduction. So it funded harm reduction. We also understand that especially with fentanyl, making sure that we have access to withdrawal management is so important, especially with people going into withdrawal after 30 minutes or an hour, we need to get people right away into withdrawal management. And then when they're getting into withdrawal management, one of our only detoxes in Portland, we turn away 200 people a month and 58% of those folks go back into the streets.","So housing and that kind of making sure that we're filling those gaps, so that people, if they can't get into that treatment program that moment, they are going along the continuum to make sure that they have the support.","CHAKRABARTI: And I would say this is actually one of the reasons why I think there's so much to be learned about how Oregon tried, and I know, I want to hear more from you about failed to implement what the ideals in Measure 110 were.","But I want to just get back to one thing. Again, this idea that the structure for building expanded treatment in Oregon wasn't there or it wasn't adequate to begin with. There was a very weak foundation to begin with. I'm listening to you talk about the wait times and the real dire need for immediate sort of emergency treatment not being available in Oregon.","There were groups who even before this measure passed, like during the campaign for the measure, pointed that out as a significant flaw in Measure 110. I was looking at some statements from Oregon Recovers, which is a non-profit advocacy, recovery-advocacy organization. And back in 2020, they said, Measure 110 is so poorly written, it will lead to additional unnecessarily deaths, but further destabilized Oregon's fractured and incomplete behavioral health system.","And then they say, it dismantles one system of intervention before building a new one, similar to the effort 40 years ago to address our growing mental health crisis by closing the outdated mental hospitals without first building the outpatient services that were needed. So that was before the measure passed.","I guess my question is, was Oregon the right state to attempt this very well-intentioned trial for decriminalization if the infrastructure just wasn't adequate to even build on at the time?","HURST: It's a good question, and I think that Oregon was absolutely the right state, and I'll say that because every day I'm hearing stories from the ground of people who are getting connected to life saving treatment services, whether that's the 41 families down in southern Oregon who have permanent housing now, and used to have to rely on the justice system or the foster care system as the only way they could get help.","And now, because of Measure 110, they're able to just be able to get the services that they need. I think it's also really important to recognize that decriminalization did what it was supposed to do, right? It reduced the stigma of addiction, and it made people feel safer to ask for help. So it reduced the barriers and harms that criminalization creates.","I don't think that we had a system that was effectively helping people who are struggling with addiction prior to 2020. Putting someone in jail is not the answer, and we see the abysmal rates of our drug courts. Some work and that's great, but ultimately it was not serving a purpose, the larger population of folks who are struggling.","So no, we did not have the infrastructure. We are building out more infrastructure and quite frankly, we're having more conversations in the legislature than ever before around addiction, around substance use and around how we actually fund it. Our legislature had made a decision to not fund behavioral health for the past couple decades.","Measure 110 really pushed their hand to make sure that those funds went into behavioral health and really started funding the services that are so critical. I think Oregon recovers, after the passage, they would be by our side pushing for those funds to continue to go into these incredible programs.","So I think a lot of times we say, Oh, we should have waited for a perfect, or even a better health care system before we stopped criminalizing people, and saddling them with criminal records, which makes it harder to access housing and employment.","CHAAKRABARTI: Yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there. But I should say that this is why, actually, there's so much, so many important lessons for the rest of the country to learn from what happened in Oregon.","I do want to just make two quick observations, though. One is we'll talk about this more in a minute, but we should not ignore the fact that it was a national group, a national nonprofit group that really funded to the tune of almost $6 million dollars, around $6 million dollars, the effort to get Measure 110 passed in Oregon.","For them, the Drug Policy Alliance, maybe that question would have been better served for them about whether Oregon was the right place, but about making it safer to ask for help.","Definitely, I see how decriminalization does that, right? Because you just, you can pick up the phone and say, I need help and not be afraid that when the police show up, you're going to end up in jail.","But one of the important aspects of 110 was that officers would be able to issue tickets, which we'll talk about in a minute, to ideally, to people who are suffering from drug addiction. And then in terms of dealing with that ticket, people had the option of seeking a health assessment instead of having to pay that $100 fine.","So there was this really big door opening for people to say, yes, I want to seek treatment now. I saw some data that said in 2021, only seven, in seven cases, seven, did defendants submit to get that health assessment instead of paying the fine. So that doesn't seem like an overwhelming success in welcoming people into the treatment system.","HURST: Oh, I totally agree. I think that part of the implementation failures was that, and again, I'm going to continue to say that we were under multiple crises. Had we implemented this law in a different time, who knows what would have happened, but the hotline that was set up and really, we relied on a hotline, because at the time we were all in lockdown. And we were recognizing that telemedicine really was a necessary thing to have at that point. And making sure that everybody had access, because this is a statewide program, but that hotline was never advertised. The hotline was not printed on the Measure 110 citation because the Measure 110 citation was never created. And so I think that ultimately, we look at that data and say, Oh it didn't work.","No, it didn't get implemented. So the fact that anybody called the hotline could be seen as a win. The tickets were never implemented, police and peers and outreach workers were not connected until we finally did that in December, on our own. And we are seeing really good results from that.","So I think that, ultimately, again, it's not the policy that was at the problem here. The real issue was not enough time for implementation. And the amount of kind of devastation that we all experienced during COVID. And then after, as people were coming out of their houses and seeing more people living on the streets. Because of Alex, what Alex said around our cost of living, in our housing crisis on the West coast, and people dying, as we heard at the beginning.","And these are people's kids and their community members. And overdose deaths are actually preventable. So we should all be working around the same table trying to solve this. And when you're in decriminalization, what was really refreshing was being able to have a conversation around health and access and not around jail and how do we keep people out of jail.","It was about how do I connect this person to the care that they need, whether or not it's culturally specific or linguistically specific care, and then let's fund those services. And that's really the heart of what's happened. And that's the heart of what people aren't hearing about. Which is the first African American female recovery house that was opened through this.","There's so many of those examples where people are getting staffing up to a level that they've never been able to. And really working with the community members on a case-by-case basis, because that's really what this takes.","CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, no, your point well taken, but I have to say, it's those specific examples, thank goodness, because Oregon needs them, but I'm still a little confused about, and yet the implementation wasn't ideal.","The money didn't roll out on time. And I don't necessarily, in my mind, separate implementation as a completely different animal than the original policy. Because one does help drive the other. So Alex, I know you're still there. Hang on for a second. I will come back to you. But I want to actually bring in Max Williams into the conversation now, because I do want to hear about what contributed to the recent passage of the state legislative bill that rolled back Measure 110, and he's the co-lead of the Coalition to Fix and Improve Measure 110. Max, welcome to On Point.","MAX WILLIAMS: Thanks for having me.","CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so was your goal to just recriminalize small, possession of small amounts of hard drugs, or was there a sort of, was there a deeper reason why you felt Measure 110 failed?","What was really the ideal here?","WILLIAMS: Sure. There was, Tera pointed out a number of the positives, outcomes of Measure 110. There was a lot of talk, given the crisis situation that Oregon was in, following Measure 110's passage about repeal. And as a former state legislator myself, I felt like a repeal was a bad idea. The good part of Measure 110 was that it captured Oregon's cannabis tax revenue, directly routed that money into treatment and recovery services, as Tera commented about. And Oregon has been woefully underfunded in that space, as we've already talked about on the show.","We were 49th out of 50 in access to treatment services, so a complete repeal would have unhooked those resources again and made them available for lots of other things, besides treatment and recovery. And that would have been a terrible mistake. But the goal was really about trying to get more people into more treatment, more quickly.","And what Measure 110 did, and its policy was, disconnect the previous system as imperfect as it was. It was actually getting people who were really struggling with difficult addictions into active treatment with the motivation of the criminal justice system. And so the goal was to use the minimal amount of criminal justice resources necessary to help motivate people who were otherwise not responding to different types of outreaches to get back into the criminal justice system and through that system into treatment and recovery.","\u003cstrong\u003ePart III\u003c/strong\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: I'm going to come back to all of you in just a second, but because we've been talking about the role that law enforcement should play when it comes to the substance abuse crisis in places like Oregon.","And Max, you had mentioned this interesting phrase, which I want to ask you more about in a second, about minimal contact with the law enforcement community. Let's just get the voice of someone who's actually doing this work. Before the COVID pandemic, Portland police officer David Baer was looking for a better shift for his family, one where he could work during daycare hours and wouldn't have to work on the weekends.","And for him, that gig was on the downtown Portland bike squad.","\u003cem\u003eDAVID BAER: It was like a ride bikes in the park, wave at people. Pick up drunks, people steal chip jars and food carts. That's what it was. It was a nothing gig. Like when I tried to get to this unit, the commander called me and was like, are you sure about this?\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eCOVID happens. Most other specialty units get disbanded. They forget about us. And we were the last unit standing in downtown. That's how we ended up as this like de facto drug enforcement unit at the street level. \u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Not only had COVID hit Portland like the rest of the country, but as we've been talking about, at the same time, so did fentanyl, which began flooding Portland's streets.","\u003cem\u003eBAER: You look at overdose numbers, it got to the point where we were leaving the station every morning with five and six doses of Narcan in our pockets, which, before Measure 110, I didn't even have Narcan. And now every day it's, 'Oh, how many Narcan's do you have? Oh, you have four? Nah, throw a couple more in the bag.'\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd so it's become this basically epidemic on our streets.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Meanwhile, Measure 110 was also in effect, meaning instead of arresting people for possessing illicit drugs such as heroin, meth, and cocaine, Officer Baer was now supposed to hand out tickets, essentially traffic violations.","\u003cem\u003eBAER: It was frustrating because, we would see people who were obviously extraordinarily addicted, right?\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eAnd we would write them a ticket, because they're smoking fentanyl on the sidewalk. And they'd be like, 'Yeah, man, I want to quit.' And we're like, 'Great, call this number.' And they're like, 'That's it? It's just a number I call.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, call the number. They'll pay the ticket for you. And you do this health screen.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eThey can hopefully get you some resources.' And they're like, 'I want resources now.' And I'm like, 'All I have is this card.' That's it. It was a number, statewide. It was really impersonal. And I just, people that wanted to get help, I had nothing for them.\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: Officer Baer says he followed the law under Measure 110 and will now follow the new law, HB 4002, which repeals decriminalization, which will kick in September.","But he says when it comes to drug addiction, law enforcement has really been in a tough spot.","\u003cem\u003eBAER: And people get upset with us. And we're like, this is passed by the Oregon voters. We're trying to spend what limited resources we have. My team is four people, right? Like we're trying to spend what resources we have on targeting drug traffickers and people bringing in huge volumes of drugs and being involved in gun crime.\u003c/em\u003e","\u003cem\u003eThis, it's been made clear to us by the voters that this is a public health issue. Unfortunately, we've also been made the vessel for treatment in terms of handing out these tickets that have these cards attached to them. It can be frustrating explaining to business owners and community members, you know, that especially now with 4002 coming into effect, that also, hey, this doesn't even start till September and then they ask, 'What is that going to look like in September?' And I go, 'I don't know yet.'\u003c/em\u003e","CHAKRABARTI: That was David Baer, member of the Central Precinct Neighborhood Response Team at the Portland Police Bureau in Portland, Oregon. Tera Hurst, let me get your view on this, because you were central in trying to advocate for a better rollout, better implementation of multiple aspects of Measure 110, including what police officers were supposed to do in those moments of contact with people suffering from drug addiction.","I hear that you tried to five or six times approach the people in the governor's office saying here's how we need to roll that out, but never got any, like, significant response from them?","HURST: Yeah, that's right. And I think that and Officer Baer, I actually cornered him in December at the Attorney General's fentanyl crisis convening and said, can we just have coffee?","And figure out how to do this better, because this isn't working. And so he, myself, Officer Baer and Janie Gullickson from the Mental Health Addiction Association of Oregon sat down and we basically, he said, 'What do you want?' And we said, 'We want to do this better. What do you guys need from us?'","And just as you heard from him, he says, 'I'm handing out this card. I don't know, it doesn't go anywhere.' And we said, 'Yeah, that was a failed system.' He said, 'Ultimately, I just want an outreach worker or somebody to come because I don't know how to connect these people to care.' And I think that's the crux of it right there.","So we decided to just create a pilot project that was very small at the beginning. And it's officer Baer and his patrol. It was also because of Governor Kotek, was creating more patrol down in downtown. So the state police were also going to be down there. And we launched a pilot with Measure 110 outreach workers and providers and the police.","So the police would say, do you want help? The person says, yes, they call a cell phone. It was very low tech, and it still is. They call a cell phone and say, 'We need outreach workers on 4th and Gleason.' So we send out two peers, they come out, the police leave, and the peers start working with folks.","We've served over 200 people so far through this pilot. And, unfortunately, because resources are so scarce, we can't do it every day, but ultimately what you're seeing on the street is police are walking away. Outreach workers are starting to work with folks and we're not talking about people who are treatment resistant or need a criminal justice nudge.","What we're talking about is people who have stood in line for detox at 6 a.m. for three days and still are getting turned away. And so the outreach workers are bringing them back to a resource center and we all work together to try and find a bed for this one person. And that has had really great success because the person is ready.","And we know that when people are ready for care, they do much better and they're able to get into long term recovery instead of being pushed and coerced.","CHAKRABARTI: The question of when are people ready? Max Williams, let me turn back to you on this, because I think that question is really at the heart of the philosophical debate over decriminalization, right?","Because as Tera has mentioned, there is quite a bit of evidence that the war on drugs for many decades now, for half a century, has been a failed policy, right? Drug abuse disorders are as high as ever. There's been disproportionate incarceration of certain groups of Americans, etc.","But on the other hand, I'm seeing here that there are, at least in Oregon, there were quite a few people from the mental health and substance abuse and health care world who were saying there does need to be some role for potential incarceration to help people get ready to ask for help.","Dr. Paul Coelho of the Salem Health Hospitals and Clinics back in 2020 said the framers of Ballot Measure 110 portray individuals with active addictions as actors who will naturally seek out and accept treatment. He said, as a frontline provider, he says that's just not true, nor is the levying of a token $100 fine.","He's just saying that some kind of threat of incarceration is necessary. But if that's the case, then, you are talking about minimal contact with law enforcement. Are we trying to have six of one, half a dozen of the other, and nothing will really change?","WILLIAMS: No I do think that, and as Tera has described, some of those programs are not going to change or wouldn't need to change, and in fact should be implemented under the new 4002.","Really, what the new legislative piece does is create a graduated approach. There are multiple off ramps for a person who gets in contact with law enforcement with the possession of these drugs. The first is a deflection program that is prearrest and can work exactly as Tera described it.","The second is more of a conditional discharge program that is like a diversion program for someone who's gotten a DUII and can be managed through the drug court. And then eventually, if that person can't succeed through either of those strategies, you can move to essentially a supervised probation-based program.","Where the person actually gets credit for their engagement in treatment. So the whole system remains designed as to keep someone out of jail and with minimal engagement, to the degree that they're actually actively participating in treatment and recovery. And I think to some degree, that may be the philosophical difference. That some folks want it just to be that, someone's going to naturally be coaxed into treatment with no consequences.","And we know that does work for some people and they don't need the criminal justice system to find treatment avenues. They're being encouraged by family members or by their employer, or by some other motivation. But for some people, particularly people who are really wrestling with severe fentanyl and meth addiction, these other motivations can play a part.","And I think there's a lot of data to suggest that has helped many people. And I certainly know that from my own experience, of people who come to me and said, 'If it wasn't for my law enforcement contact, if it wasn't for the justice system contact, I would have never ultimately sought treatment.'","So what we're trying to do is create a system. And I would say, even with Oregon's recriminalization of, you know, these misdemeanor charges and our off ramps, we are still perhaps the most progressive state in the nation with respect to dealing with people who are in possession of these lethal street drugs. So it's not like we rolled back, and reinstituted some war on drugs philosophy.","This is a very thoughtful philosophy. It's got its own implementation challenges. And Tera and I both have strong feelings about the poor implementation approach that often happens in Oregon. And this is going to go into effect in on the 1st of September. And I think it's going to be successful in some counties, and it's going to have struggles and others try to figure it out.","But we didn't try to roll back all of Measure 110. What we tried to do is create a system that balances both the individual needs and the one part that we haven't talked about is the community aspect of this.","CHAKRABARTI: Can I just jump in here? Because I'm afraid, I'm just running out of time, Max. And you got to forgive me.","But just to clarify what you said that the deflection program, is a law enforcement deflection program is going to be rolled out on a county-by-county basis voluntarily. So some counties may choose not to participate in it, but we have to wait and see on that. Alex Kral, you've been incredibly patient here and I'm very grateful for it.","But again, to zoom out a little in terms of what the rest of the country can learn from what happened in Oregon, I'm seeing several themes here. There was just a terrible, perfect storm of events around the passage of Measure 110, right? COVID, fentanyl, increasing homelessness in Oregon. But also, I would still say an inadequate extant infrastructure to really, to build a rapidly growing system of treatment and recovery.","Just because Oregon did rank 49th out of 50th, as we've talked about. Lots of people look to a completely different place on how to roll out these things differently. They look to Portugal, right? The entire nation, which decriminalized drugs, but it took them longer, four to five years, before they started seeing the fruits of those efforts.","At the same time, from my understanding, they also started with a better treatment system nationwide in Portugal, did they not, Alex?","KRAL: Yeah, I think the key here is, and as part of our 4-year evaluation, we conducted a couple of years ago, two studies, one in Oregon with law enforcement and one with people who use drugs.","And I think one of the things that's not been mentioned here is that you had 50 years of criminalization and it's going to take time to change that piece, right? It doesn't happen culturally over time. We heard from law enforcement officers where they were against M110 to begin with.","They thought it would fail. They weren't bought into it. And so a lot of the systems that people are talking about is, you're trying to involve police in a system, where people who use drugs, they're not credible sources for them. And so here you are, you're a person of drugs.","And for 50 years, people have been arresting you. And that's been the only thing to have, to all of a sudden think that those law enforcement are going to be credible sources, whether that be through these citations or whether it be through some of these deflection programs that are now being planned.","I think there's a question about that. Because I don't think that, they're not trained, law enforcement is not trained to be social workers and to help people into that. And they're not seen as such by people using drugs. That's what our data found. But if you are talking about Portugal, yeah, it is a very different system. If, you know, they have now allowed that system, their decriminalization has been now over 20 years.","And as you pointed out, the first few years, we didn't really see, the evaluations didn't really see any benefits, but after 4 or 5 years, they started to see that and some of that has to do with a socialized medicine type system, whereby you do have more access to treatment and where people are credible sources for treatment. Where they feel like people who are in government are actually there to help them in some form.","Whereas that's not necessarily the case after 50 years of having governmental agents in Oregon, basically think of its people using drugs, as arrests and jail being the only solution.","CHAKRABARTI: That's not the case anywhere in the United States. So social context is really different, right?","It's not just Oregon. Just continue. I just want to also just emphasize that this measure was passed in November of 2020. We were already deep in the grips of COVID, but the Drug Policy Alliance based in New York, they spent $5 million of their own money. An overall $6 million went into getting this measure passed.","In Oregon, the \"no\" team spent $167,000 just as a point of reference here. But it just makes me wonder, even though we knew COVID was going on, we knew that the fentanyl crisis was hitting hard, et cetera, this group continued to push to get Measure 110 passed in the middle of a perfect storm. I'm just asking a counterfactual, sort of for the sake of asking it.","None of you have to answer. What would it have been like if maybe they held back and waited a couple of years to try to pass it in a time where the perfect storm wasn't going on? Nobody can answer that yet, I know. But, Tera Hurst, we have 15 seconds-ish left. I'm just wondering what you think Oregonians need, right?","The people who are suffering from the drug addiction crisis. I'll give you the last 10 seconds here, now more than ever.","HURST: We really need to be focused on setting up our system of care. We should not be distracted by creating a new criminal justice on ramp and off ramp and recognizing that people of color are the ones that are most harmed and least helped by the criminal justice system. And the racial impact statement on this new law is, already shows that it's going to be harsher on Black and Latinx communities. So I think what we need is to be getting around the table and really talking about, 'How do we get people connected to care and what care do we need?' So that we can have rapid access to care."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/01/1235419426/oregon-legislature-votes-to-recriminalize-drugs","title":"Oregon legislature votes to recriminalize drugs","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/27/1240892448/why-oregons-groundbreaking-drug-decriminalization-experiment-is-coming-to-an-end","title":"Why Oregon's groundbreaking drug decriminalization experiment is coming to an end","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/27/1197964454/oregon-decriminalization","title":"Oregon's Drug Decriminalization Experiment : Fresh Air","prefix":""},{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/08/1196979754/here-now-anytime-03-08-2024","title":"Oregon de-criminalized drug possession in 2020.

Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the study.","Nadeau, who is also a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said that the estimate of 50,000 asthma cases is “conservative,” since the study only considered one of several pollutants emitted by gas and propane stoves. When considering other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, “the full impact may be closer to 200,000 cases,” she said.","The study also found that people living in residences smaller than 800 square feet experienced four times more long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide than people living in residences larger than 3,000 square feet.
