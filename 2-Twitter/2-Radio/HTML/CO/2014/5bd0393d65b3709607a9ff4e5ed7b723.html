<text>Grand Junction Police are warning people in Colorado to be cautious and to look out for a
scam that has been taking place in Grand Junction and on the western slope. The scam
targets elderly women who are alone in a parking lot. A well-dressed man will approach
such a woman, posing a simple good citizen warning them that their tire is flat. While
the man is distracting the woman, their partner can break into the victimâs car. In all such
incidents that have taken place, the victim's credit cards were used immediately in nearby
stores. Authorities say, be wary of strangers, even if they appear friendly. If a scammer
insists on showing you your flat tire, tell the scammer you will call for help and stay in
your vehicle. Always be aware of your surroundings and pay attention to those around
you. And, never leave your purse or wallet unattended. And, don't forget to report
suspicious activity.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<text>The Great Sand Dunes National Park and preserve is warning visitors to pack some extra
patience before heading to the park for the next few weekends as traffic is typically heavy
at the park this time of year. NPS says the congestion this time of year is due to the
popularity of Medano Creek, which is at peak flow in Late May and Early June. The
park service says that visitors should be prepared to wait over an hour in a traffic line up
to three miles long to enter the park. Then, once inside the park, the closest parking may
be up to a mile away from the dunes. The park service also reminds visitors that sand
sled rentals are located at area businesses outside the National Park. The Park Service

<big><b>CO Gov Polis signs 3 funeral home industry regulation bills into law.</b></big><p><p>
<text>Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Friday signed three bills into law to regulate the
funeral home industry in the state. SB24-173 requires funeral home professionals to
obtain a license by passing a background check, graduating from an approved mortuary
science school, pass the national board examination and serving an apprenticeship.
HB24-1335 gives the department of regulatory agencies more oversight of the funeral
home industry, allowing inspections at any time and allows grounds for discipline.
HB24-1254 further regulates non-transplant tissue banks, prohibiting a funeral home
owner from owning any portion of a body brokering business. The bills should go into
effect by the end of the year, however, there is a months-long rule making process that
must take place before that can happen.</a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<text>Drivers in Colorado will be prohibited from talking on or otherwise using their
cellphones while driving if Governor Jared Polis signs SB24-65 into law. Polis says he
will sign the bill, which passed the Colorado Legislature this year. The bill would create
some exceptions, including for drivers who use hands-free accessories. Under the bill, a
driver can't be cited for talking on or using their cellphone while driving unless a law
enforcement officer sees them doing so in a "manner that caused the individual to drive
in a careless and imprudent manner, without due regard for the width, grade, curves,
corners, traffic and use of the streets and highways and all other attendant
circumstances". An officer will have to see the phone either in a driver's hand or pinned
against their ear to issue a citation. A first offense is subject to a $75 fine and two points.

<big><b>EPA to require Colorado to use more expensive reformulated gasoline.</b></big><p><p>
<text>The Environmental Protection Agency is requiring drivers in Colorado to use, and
gasoline stations to sell, reformulated gasoline after the agency downgraded the air
quality for the northern front range to severe status in 2022. And, that means that gas
prices could increase by as much as 60 cents per gallon for the reformulated gasoline. It
is not clear just when the EPA mandate will take effect. And, that mandate doesn't sit
well with Governor Jared Polis. Last month, Polis sent an official request for a waiver
from the new rule to the EPA saying that Colorado has taken other steps to reduce
emissions. Polis says the mandate is based on a third-party study done to look at the
potential of Colorado switching to reformulated gasoline. The mandate is reportedly only
temporary for the summer months.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

nearly 440,000 low-wage workers in Colorado are victims of wage theft every year. The
report says that wage theft costs the state over $45 million in tax revenue each year. The
vetoed bill, HB24-1008, would have held general contractors liable for wage theft
committed by subcontractors. The construction industry fought against the bill, arguing

touch the embers. And, never leave a campfire unattended.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<big><b>New report shows CO taxpayers could lose billions in Tabor refunds.</b></big><p><p>
<text>A new report from the Common Sense Institute of Colorado shows that taxpayers could
lose billions in Tabor refunds if legislation that lawmakers passed in this year's
legislative session is signed into law. The report says that more than 100 bills passed this
year could reduce tabor refunds by a combined $2.8 billion over the next three years, or
about half of the $6 billion in projected Tabor Refunds between 2024 and 2026. Instead
of being refunded to taxpayers, the report says the money will be redirected "towards
targeted tax reductions for specific groups, mainly families and low-income Coloradans".
Approved by voters in 1992, The Taxpayer Bill Of Rights, or Tabor, puts caps on the
amount of tax revenue the state can keep year-to-year. Once tax revenue hits that magic
number, the state must give all the surplus revenue back to taxpayers. Critics say tax
credits or tax reductions are not what taxpayers had in mind when tabor was originally
approved.</a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<big><b>CO GOP recommending alternatives to public school system after new law.</b></big><p><p>
<text>The Colorado Republican Party is recommending that parents find alternatives to
Colorado's public school system following recently passed legislation that they say
pushes education toward indoctrination. The message is in response to House Bill 24-
1039, which was signed into law, and requires that teachers call students by their "chosen
name". In an article published Tuesday entitled "LGBTQ indoctrination in public
schools", Darcy Schoening, director of special initiatives for the Colorado GOP, says the
bill violates parental rights and the teacher's 1st and 14th amendment rights. Schoening
recommends that parents remove their children from public schools and find alternative
solutions, like private schools or homeschooling. The GOP is also asking for support to
an opposition resolution to HB24-1039.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<big><b>CDOT announces US 50 Blue Mesa bridge repair plan.</b></big><p><p> 
<text>The Colorado Department of Transportation has announced the U.S. 50 Blue Mesa
Bridge repair plan to prioritize fixing cracks and critical issues in four areas that pose an
imminent risk to the structural integrity of the bridge. This will be part of phase one
repairs and will safely expedite emergency vehicles and lighter loads being allowed back
on the bridge first until permanent repairs can be completed. The goal is to restore
limited vehicle access by July 4th. Subsequent phases of construction will further
strengthen the structure and are expected to get heavier loads back on the bridge by fall of
this year. Critical inspections for the U.S. 50 Blue Mesa Bridge have been completed and
have identified 118 critical inspection locations. These internal anomalies, or defects,
will require mitigation and repair for long-term serviceability of the bridge, but do not
pose an immediate threat to the integrity of the structure.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>

<big><b>EPA announces funding grant to the City of Pueblo.</b></big><p><p> 
<text>The Environmental Protection Agency Brownsfield Division has announced that it is
funding a $1 million grant to the City of Pueblo. The grant money will be used to clean
up and renovate some of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, some of which have a rich
industrial history. The city will use the grant money to do cleanup work but also to help
non-profit or private developers do assessments to see if they have problems with
contaminants like lead and asbestos. Monies will help these developers determine who
big their problem is and potentially help them apply for other grants to help with the
cleanup of contaminants.</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><p></text>
