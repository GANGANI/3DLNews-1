For several years, her popularity grew around such memorable originals as \"Bring Me Some Water,\" \"No Souvenirs\" and \"Ain't It Heavy,\" for which she won a Grammy® in 1992. Etheridge hit her commercial and artistic stride with her fourth album, \u003ci\u003eYes I Am\u003c/i\u003e (1993). The collection featured the massive hits, \"I'm the Only One\" and \"Come to My Window,\" a searing song of longing that brought Etheridge her second Grammy® Award for Best Female Rock Performance. In 1995, Etheridge issued her highest charting album, \u003ci\u003eYour Little Secret\u003c/i\u003e, which was distinguished by the hit single, \"I Want to Come Over.\" Her astounding success that year led to Etheridge receiving the Songwriter of the Year honor at the ASCAP Pop Awards in 1996.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnown for her confessional lyrics and raspy, smoky vocals, Etheridge has remained one of America's favorite female singers for more than two decades.

Earlier in her recording career, Etheridge acknowledged her sexual orientation when it was considered less than prudent to do so. In October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, a health battle that, with her typical tenacity, she won. Despite losing her hair from chemotherapy, Etheridge appeared on the 2005 Grammy® telecast to sing \"Piece of My Heart\" in tribute to Janis Joplin.

These songs embody all that makes Daigle who she is\u0026nbsp;–an inspiring\u0026nbsp;and optimistic spirit whose creative curiosity and authenticity drive her hope that somewhere in her lyrics, catchy melodies or groove, people will come together and connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDaigle was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and grew up in Lafayette, singing constantly and absorbing the local zydeco, blues and Cajun music. She loved pop stars like Celine Dion and Whitney Houston and soul icons like Aretha Franklin Al Green and James Brown; at her elementary school, they played “Respect” every morning before the Pledge of Allegiance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut she didn’t take music seriously until an illness kept her out of high school for two years, and she began taking voice lessons.

Not only a multi-award-winning musician known for her genre-bending virtuosity on electronic violin, she’s endlessly dazzled audiences with her extraordinary talents as a dancer—an element she brings to the stage as part of her spectacular live show, touring with a stunning frequency and continually selling out iconic venues all around the world. Also a \u003ci\u003eNew York Times\u003c/i\u003e bestselling author (and creator of her own comic book), the platinum-selling star felt compelled to push her boundaries even further for her seventh full-length effort, ultimately embracing a whole new level of freedom in her songwriting. A visionary meditation on inner wisdom, personal strength, and the ever-shifting nature of identity, \u003ci\u003eDuality\u003c/i\u003e arrives as Stirling’s most sonically daring and emotionally complex album date.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-left:0px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:inherit;color:windowtext;font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;\"\u003eMade with producers/co-writers like Graham Muron (Thirty Seconds to Mars, Skrillex) and Lucky West (Walk the Moon, Dreamers), \u003ci\u003eDuality\u003c/i\u003e encompasses a dozen songs showcasing Stirling’s refined musicality and gift for sculpting deeply expressive melodies. But while the album’s first half centers on a grandiose and elaborately composed sound informed by Celtic music and other global influences, its latter half leans toward a boldly original form of left-of-center pop. To that end, side A includes such tracks as “Eye Of The Untold Her,” a gloriously epic piece produced by Mako (a musician/songwriter/producer whose credits include co-producing top-selling releases from video-game giant Riot Games) and co-written with Steve Mazzaro (a composer who’s worked with the legendary Hans Zimmer to arrange and produce the music for the Oscar winner’s world tours). Meanwhile, side B spotlights Stirling’s pop sensibilities on songs like the luminous “Inner Gold” (featuring alt-pop artist Royal \u0026amp; the Serpent) and “Survive” (on which Walk off the Earth vocalist Sarah Blackwood joins in for an interpolation of Gloria Gaynor’s disco classic “I Will Survive”).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-left:0px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:inherit;color:windowtext;font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;\"\u003eA profoundly imaginative songwriter whose past work includes such high-concept albums as 2019’s \u003ci\u003eArtemis\u003c/i\u003e—a No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart—Stirling makes brilliant use of \u003ci\u003eDuality\u003c/i\u003e’s extravagant soundscape by exploring intricate questions of intuition and truth. “I’ve always felt that we’re all magical beings with so much spirit and potential, but we live in a world of expectations and rules that often makes us feel so constrained,” Stirling says. “I hope that in some way these songs help people to feel free and empowered and more connected to their truest selves.

We’ve always drawn inspiration from artists we love, and at times we’ve even emulated some of them to a certain degree. With this album, having gone through so much, life had almost forced us into becoming more and more comfortable with ourselves.

But their self-titled debut album in ’71 went beyond just leather and motorcycles, revealing even more musical layers; sweet three-part harmonies and rootsy, introspective, acoustic flavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Doobie Brothers’ legacy has been built upon not just hit records, but also an unrivaled commitment to musical integrity and a steadfast allegiance to their enthusiastic fan base. The bands ability to evolve in a constantly changing industry and connections to generations of listening audiences is a testament to their craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all began in 1969, when a drummer named John Hartman arrived in Northern California. He was there to meet Skip Spence from the band Moby Grape and become part of a supposed band reunion that never quite got off the ground. But it wasn’t all for naught. Spence (who had also played in the Jefferson Airplane) introduced Hartman to his friend Tom Johnston, a local singer/songwriter/guitarist -and they connected. Hartman and Johnston began playing local Bay Area bars. They soon met singer/guitarist Pat Simmons, whose finger-style playing richly complimented Johnston’s R\u0026amp;B strumming-style, and the foundation for The Doobie Brothers was set.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile their debut album in 1971 did not chart, just a year a later, their second record, Toulouse Street, became a breakout sensation. Producer Ted Templeman helped the band craft a sound that was organic, yet radio friendly, and brought in Little Feat keyboardist Bill Payne to add unique musical textures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom there The Doobies hit the road, tirelessly working their way around the world. They established themselves with a breathtaking run of hits on Warner Bros. Records that tapped into a myriad of American styles. “Listen to the Music,” “Jesus is Just Alright,” “China Grove,” “Black Water,” “Rockin’ Down the Highway,” “Long Train Runnin’” and other anthemic singles confirmed their status as fine craftsman who could also rock arenas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1974, Steely Dan co-lead guitarist and session legend Jeff “Skunk” Baxter joined the band as third guitarist, one of many unique and talented players who would revolve in and out of the band over the years. The group’s expanded lineup was augmented in 1975 by Michael McDonald, whose soulful vocals and songwriting led to the hits “What a Fool Believes,” “Minute by Minute,” “Takin’ It To The Streets,” and “You Belong To Me.” Multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, John McFee, joined in 1978 bringing his wide range of musical styles and experience recording with Van Morrison, Steve Miller, Elvis Costello, and The Grateful Dead to The Doobies’ sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe collaborative, almost communal sense of family within the band allowed them to stay fresh and unpredictable over the years, while never forsaking their deep American musical roots, boogie-jams and all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a respite in the early 80s, the band reunited in 1987 for a series of gigs benefiting veterans’ groups and children’s charities (ultimately raising millions). Those shows at the Hollywood Bowl were the fastest sell-outs since the Beatles had played there more than 20 years earlier. In a Los Angeles Times poll the year before, fans voted Led Zeppelin and The Doobie Brothers the bands they wanted most to see reunite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContinuing to record, The Doobies released World Gone Crazy in 2010, produced by Ted Templeman, and Southbound on Arista Nashville in 2014. Southbound, produced by David Huff, featured new recordings of the band’s iconic hits, with country music’s biggest stars including Blake Shelton, Zac Brown Band, Brad Paisley, and Toby Keith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, have won four GRAMMY® Awards and sold more than 48 million records worldwide (including three multi-platinum, seven platinum, and 14 gold albums). Their 1976 Best of the Doobies has sold more than 12 million copies, earning rare RIAA Diamond status. Their No. 1 gold-certified singles “Black Water” (1974) and “What a Fool Believes” (1979) lead a catalog of hits that includes “Listen to the Music,” “Jesus Is Just All Right,” “Rockin’ Down the Highway,” “Long Train Runnin’,” “China Grove,” “Take Me In Your Arms,” Takin’ It to the Streets,” “Minute by Minute,” “You Belong to Me,” and “The Doctor.” In all, The Doobies have tallied five Top 10 singles and 16 Top 40 hits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“We’re basically an American band – we cover a lot of areas,” says Johnston. “We cover blues, R\u0026amp;B, country, bluegrass, and rock ‘n’ roll. It’s based on rhythms, rhythm structures, picking, and harmonies. That’s been the signature of the band.” He continues, “You take Pat, who comes from a folk/blues background, with a lot of picking and stuff like that; he was a big fan of Rev. Gary Davis and Dave Van Ronk. I come from a blues, soul, R\u0026amp;B, and rock ‘n’ roll background. Then you stick John McFee into that mix. John came from a country background when he started out and was in the country band Southern Pacific. And he is a session musician – he’s played with everybody from Steve Miller to Van Morrison to Elvis Costello. If it’s got strings, he can play it.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“We all have the same work ethic,” says multi-instrument virtuoso McFee, self-described as the “new guy.” “Tom, Pat and I are still surging ahead. We’ve stayed together as friends as well as musicians. We are compelled to challenge ourselves. I mean, I love playing the old songs. But when we’re working on new material now, I think we’re coming up with better parts. The band has always been good, so it’s kind of like we’re competing with ourselves. But honestly, we’re playing better than ever.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimmons notes, “We didn’t really sit around and think, ‘Oh, we need this element or that element.’ The music has always been an honest representation of whatever we happen to be working on at the time. We had all been playing music for a long time before we put the band together, and our roots influences are what come out. Those influences always overtake whatever conceptual ideas you might have. It’s always been that way with this band — you always return to who you really are.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ability of The Doobie Brothers’ music to connect with the essentials of people’s lives in tuneful, affecting songs has developed an audience that spans generations today. Known for their dynamic live performances, the band plays close to 100 shows a year touring worldwide, delighting concert goers of all ages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimmons adds, “We have a hardcore fan base that has handed our music down through the years to their children and their children’s children. Repeatedly, people go to our concerts and come up to us and say, ‘My dad turned me on to you guys years ago, and I’ve loved you guys all this time, and my kids are listening to you now.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“And the songs that people all know, be it ‘Listen to the Music,’ ‘Black Water’ or ‘China Grove,’ are still getting played,” Johnston adds. “Any song that stands the test of time for 40 years or is getting played around the country on a daily basis – that to me is a testament to the quality of the tunes, and that they have something to say that resonates with people. I’d like to say this band has been relevant – it’s been relevant musically, it’s been relevant lyrically, and we’ve always put out a high quality of music.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey take none of it for granted. And their music has proven to be relatable for generations since they first came together, which is why they continue to make new music. The fundamental appeal that has drawn listeners to this group for four decades may be best expressed by Simmons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“In a certain sense, what this band has always had in common with everyone else is the word ‘hope.’ We hoped we would make some good music, and we hoped there would be some acceptance, and we hoped that things would get better in the world. In that respect, we’re just the same – we’re still hopeful about the future.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe mere name of the band gives one hope. And it makes you think, it makes you feel and makes you appreciate the efforts of one of America’s most dependable musical outfits. It takes you back, while also helping you look ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-left:0px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:13px;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ePresented by Walmart AMP in partnership with Live Nation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","performance_ticket_limit":8,"purchase_path":"SeatMap","purchase_external_url":null,"square_image":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzmmp6jku/image/upload/v1705866023/AMP_Doobie_Brothers_900x900_ea89052ba6.jpg","alternativeText":null,"width":900,"height":900}}},"calendar_image":{"data":null},"venue":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Walmart AMP","geofence":[{"latitude":37.42650721011171,"longitude":-97.71823483703102},{"latitude":37.63638597142275,"longitude":-90.11036196917348},{"latitude":34.53765375048918,"longitude":-89.59138499604101},{"latitude":34.2204062703083,"longitude":-97.65934265202368}]}}},"hero_image":{"data":{"attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzmmp6jku/image/upload/v1706030053/AMP_Doobie_Brothers_1600x900_new_b1b341c6f1.jpg","alternativeText":null,"width":1600,"height":900}}},"seatmap_image":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"AMP_SectionMap_The Doobie Brothers 2024.jpg","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzmmp6jku/image/upload/v1705688830/AMP_Section_Map_The_Doobie_Brothers_2024_a9cf508067.jpg","alternativeText":null}}},"seo":[{"id":"34","metaTitle":"The Doobie Brothers at Walmart AMP","metaDescription":"The Doobie Brothers at Walmart AMP.

Following a successful self-booked tour with\u0026nbsp;Paula Cole\u0026nbsp;in 1996, McLachlan co-founded the touring festival Lilith Fair with the purpose of billing female musicians back-to-back, something of an anomaly for concert promoters at the time.

During that stretch in the late '90s, McLachlan had two U.S. Top Five hits in \"Adia\" and \"Angel,\" both from her Canadian chart-topping, U.S. number two\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003eSurfacing\u003c/i\u003e, her fourth studio LP.
