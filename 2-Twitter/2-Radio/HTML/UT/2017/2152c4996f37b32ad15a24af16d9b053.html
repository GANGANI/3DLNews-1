Tommy decides he’ll direct the movie, hiring a professional crew using money from sources no one can fathom.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reference&quot;,&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;published&quot;:true,&quot;mime_type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;roles&quot;:[],&quot;galleries&quot;:[],&quot;originalName&quot;:&quot;the-room-1-38-48-28.jpg&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:[&quot;&quot;],&quot;owner&quot;:&quot;spmeans@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;proxyUrl&quot;:&quot;/photo/resize/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;resizeUrl&quot;:&quot;http://resizer.shared.arcpublishing.com/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:1513815515533,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;originalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;}},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_do_not_inflate&quot;:true}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;REIUNELITRDTVKWQYCK2OU6G4E&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1513812729048,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The Room” tells the story of Johnny, played by Wiseau, who is depicted as the all-American guy.

One screening in early December nearly sold out the 340-seat theater, the weekend before the Broadway opened “The Disaster Artist,” the movie directed by James Franco that tells the story of how “The Room” got made. (I went to “The Room” the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and there were about 40 people there.)&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;LNZUUP7AJFHP7O54ZI44HSYCEU&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1513812729048,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;As shown in &lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/movies/2017/12/07/james-franco-makes-a-good-movie-about-a-bad-one-in-the-disaster-artist/\&quot;&gt;Franco’s movie&lt;/a&gt;, and his astonishing performance as Wiseau, the story behind “The Room” is far more interesting than the movie itself. Wiseau, a self-generated parody of a movie star with an indefinable accent from somewhere in eastern Europe, befriends struggling actor Greg Sestero (played by James’ brother, Dave Franco), and together they try to make it in Hollywood. When Tommy fails utterly in his quest, he writes the script for “The Room,” in which he and Greg will star. Tommy decides he’ll direct the movie, hiring a professional crew using money from sources no one can fathom.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reference&quot;,&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;published&quot;:true,&quot;mime_type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;roles&quot;:[],&quot;galleries&quot;:[],&quot;originalName&quot;:&quot;the-room-1-38-48-28.jpg&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:[&quot;&quot;],&quot;owner&quot;:&quot;spmeans@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;proxyUrl&quot;:&quot;/photo/resize/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;resizeUrl&quot;:&quot;http://resizer.shared.arcpublishing.com/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:1513815515533,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;originalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;}},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_do_not_inflate&quot;:true}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;REIUNELITRDTVKWQYCK2OU6G4E&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1513812729048,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The Room” tells the story of Johnny, played by Wiseau, who is depicted as the all-American guy.

He’s good to his best friend, Mark (played by Sestero), and mentor to a teen, Denny (Philip Haldiman, played in “The Disaster Artist” by Josh Hutcherson).

has a lot of targets in his sights, including consumerism, do-gooding scientists and the obliviousness of well-to-do people to see beyond their own navels. And the premise he and co-writer Jim Taylor devise seems like a perfect projectile to hit those targets: a near future where scientists have devised a way to shrink human bodies to 5 inches tall, a development the scientists say can solve the world’s ills of overpopulation and diminishing resources.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;5CFI3MR75BH2ZB7FAJCYFT3F4Q&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1513796995223,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;We experience the process vicariously through the Safraneks, Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey (Kristen Wiig), a nondescript middle-class couple in Omaha. The Safraneks aren’t unhappy, really, but are less than satisfied with their jobs and lives. When they attend a high-school reunion and see an old friend, Dave (Jason Sudeikis), who has been reduced down to action-figure size, they start thinking about a major change.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;OS3G5QYXTNEKVEVCJRSXGTTYCI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reference&quot;,&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1513883168694,&quot;comments&quot;:[]}},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/UCrBICYM0yM&quot;,&quot;service&quot;:&quot;oembed&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=&quot;},&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_do_not_inflate&quot;:true}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;J7VVXQG3HFGTZBZB5KNRYNTU6U&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1513796995224,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Paul and Audrey go to Leisure Land, a “downsized” suburbia, where they get the spiel from a happy couple-turned-QVC salespeople (played by Neil Patrick Harris and Payne’s “Citizen Ruth” star, Laura Dern, in a gem of a scene). Once a couple are downsized, they’re told, their meager savings will buy the McMansion of their dreams. After a sales rep (Niecy Nash) runs them through the deal as if she were selling a timeshare, Paul and Audrey buy in.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VKEYKF4PCBECRMRKN3JNF4ESTQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1513796995226,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;But after the elaborate shrinking process — a sequence where much of the movie’s whimsical visual style is deployed — Paul discovers there are downsides to downsizing. He soon learns there are hustlers in the small world just like in the big one, like his hard-partying neighbor Dusan (Christoph Waltz), who repurposes smuggled Cuban cigars for small people. There also are scroungers, like Dusan’s cleaning woman, Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who was shrunk against her will and is now aiding the small community’s hidden underclass.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;7ZV4K3HUN5HXLNRH3DKYLROUFI&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reference&quot;,&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;roles&quot;:[],&quot;mime_type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:1513797202993,&quot;originalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ZV4K3HUN5HXLNRH3DKYLROUFI.aspx&quot;,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;resizeUrl&quot;:&quot;http://resizer.shared.arcpublishing.com/aOhioeisZ5eASxAAUuIIK59RqM4=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/7ZV4K3HUN5HXLNRH3DKYLROUFI.aspx&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:[&quot;christoph waltz&quot;,&quot;hong chau&quot;],&quot;galleries&quot;:[],&quot;takenOn&quot;:&quot;2017-12-08T02:12:31+00:00&quot;,&quot;usage_instructions&quot;:&quot;AP PROVIDES ACCESS TO THIS THIRD PARTY PHOTO SOLELY TO ILLUSTRATE NEWS REPORTING OR COMMENTARY ON FACTS DEPICTED IN IMAGE; MUST BE USED WITHIN 14 DAYS FROM TRANSMISSION; NO ARCHIVING; NO LICENSING; MANDATORY CREDIT&quot;,&quot;proxyUrl&quot;:&quot;/photo/resize/aOhioeisZ5eASxAAUuIIK59RqM4=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/7ZV4K3HUN5HXLNRH3DKYLROUFI.aspx&quot;,&quot;published&quot;:true,&quot;originalName&quot;:&quot;ContentBroker.aspx&quot;}},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7ZV4K3HUN5HXLNRH3DKYLROUFI&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_do_not_inflate&quot;:true}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;W5CIKTRZ3NA6FA74ZVTDKZU7TQ&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:1513796995226,&quot;comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Payne and Taylor could have plenty to say about the voracious haves and the striving have-nots, something that might resonate as the world’s ever-ravenous 1 percent takes all the pie.

Tommy decides he’ll direct the movie, hiring a professional crew using money from sources no one can fathom.&quot;},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;reference&quot;,&quot;referent&quot;:{&quot;referent_properties&quot;:{&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;published&quot;:true,&quot;mime_type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;roles&quot;:[],&quot;galleries&quot;:[],&quot;originalName&quot;:&quot;the-room-1-38-48-28.jpg&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:[&quot;&quot;],&quot;owner&quot;:&quot;spmeans@sltrib.com&quot;,&quot;proxyUrl&quot;:&quot;/photo/resize/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;resizeUrl&quot;:&quot;http://resizer.shared.arcpublishing.com/30lg_r_Q89y46tL3ccEDsHrJ_yo=/0x300/filters:quality(75)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:1513815515533,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;originalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4.jpg&quot;}},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;VEEQMUZ7RNAH3C3XKZ6VH4JMT4&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_do_not_inflate&quot;:true}},{&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;REIUNELITRDTVKWQYCK2OU6G4E&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;additional_properties&quot;:{&quot;_id&quot;:1513812729048,&quot;comments&quot;:[],&quot;inline_comments&quot;:[]},&quot;content&quot;:&quot;“The Room” tells the story of Johnny, played by Wiseau, who is depicted as the all-American guy.
