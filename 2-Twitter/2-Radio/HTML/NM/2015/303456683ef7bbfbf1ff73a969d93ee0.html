Before she could open the trauma can though, she attempted to enable some nerd news (which kind of led into the childhood trauma Daily Discussion Topic) by talking about a naked man who was arrested after climbing a bumblebee statue in New Mexico. The thing was, she assumed it was Transformers being discussed but in reality it was an actual bumblebee that the man was swinging dong from. As usual, we don't do research on this show because that would involve effort. Anyway, another guy was also arrested recently but instead of waving his magic wand, he used the product of his to drive him home. A kid and his drunk dad were pulled over after his pickup truck ran off the street, onto a sidewalk and over some traffic cones. The 14 year old was behind the wheel and in the passenger seat was John Storms, the kids father who was litty kitty and instructed him on how to drive. After getting out of the car, the father did a little dance in the street and was promptly arrested for several different things including public drunkeness, etc. Funny enough, Angi also drunk drove her father at 14 and though she was probably lit on wine coolers, her long and tall gangly limbs were able to hit the pedals and get them back to the house without issue. She probably could have died but if the 600 other ailments that she currently has haven't taken her out yet, driving at 14 surely wasn't going to do it. Another time, her stepfather picked her up from school when she was a kid and went straight to the bar. He proceeded to drink for 4 or 5 hours and had her sit in the backseat, which was cold and told her to do her homework. As usual, at crappy life poker, Angi always has some variation of trump cards. As for Marris, he brother was left in charge of him when he was an &quot;infantile.&quot; Apparently, Marris rolled off the bed and when his parents asked what happened, his brother matter of factly stated &quot;you told me to watch him and I watched him roll off the bed.&quot; How Marris, who again was &quot;infantile&quot; knows this story is due to the age old tradition of passing trauma stories down from family member to family member to laugh over at the dinner table. Normally, I'd add my own trauma stories here but it's my birthday and I'm upset enough about that already as is so instead, I'm going to just move right along to the roadies on the Request Line to hear about how their parents almost killed them. Brett was sick at 10 and she thought she had strep throat. Her parents ignored her and she got sicker and sicker, to the point she couldn't eat, sleep or drink and her throat was swollen. It turned out she had strep throat for two weeks and the doctor told her parents they were horrible people and that she could have died if they had waited another week. Richie's mom took him to the YMCA (you know you shimmied reading that) to learn how to swim. Her idea of this was throwing him in the water and letting him get back to her while she laughed with friends. Bob's dad had him trimming trees at 11 in some of the most questionable parenting I've heard in some time. Jennifer was 2 when her dad was carrying her around the living room drunk and he almost accidentally put her through a window but the family dog saved her. Mike's father was drunk (recurring theme here eh) and he was racing down a dead end street and the car ended up in a field where it flew like \u003cem>The Dukes of Hazzard\u003c/em>. John's dad did that thing where you tied a rope to a car and then to a sled and took it through the streets, which nowadays seems highly insane. Funny enough (one upper) Angi did that as a kid as well only when her dad rounded a corner, she flew into a parked car.

This perception shifter wrecked Angi's childhood (she was like 60 when that movie came out so let's play make believe.) Apparently, the barracuda that was blamed for the loss of Nemo's mother and all his siblings was not the cause of the mass extinction event. It turns out that Mrs. Vorhees was the kille...wait, wrong movie. Nemo's mother was the culprit because in actual life, female clownfish tend to eat their eggs and barracudas do not. So the death that swept the ocean that day was triggered by mother clown fish (who then went on to get eaten or something, this part was unclear.) The point is that Nemo only lived due to sheer luck or maybe because she was too full. Had she lived though, there is a good chance she would have probably eaten Nemo as well. While Angi's therapist put her calls to voicemail, she continued on how Coral was just an absolute bitch. See, marine biologists showcased that female clown fish eat their young while the males tend to them. Though the males will eat damaged eggs/kids and during the first few attempts, the parents will end up eating all the eggs for fun. This underwater horror story also has an even darker tone in that Nemo may have not actually existed. See, another swing showcased that Nemo may have been eaten and simply never existed and the whole movie is a hallucinated fever dream. After all, Nemo translates to &quot;nobody.&quot; That's right, you were actually watching Finding Nobody! Basically, Tiktok is out to ruin your childhood by showcasing the true horrors of nature and these reveals were blowing Marris' mind. Then again, all the Disney movies were kind of sinister. \u003cem>Bambi\u003c/em>, \u003cem>The Lion King\u003c/em>, \u003cem>Dumbo\u003c/em>, dead parents about with built in childhood traumas. It's almost like Disney writers were all high on acid or shroomed out and decided to really screw us up (and then benefit later by making PTSD-addled adults love their parks.) Obviously, Pixar won't confirm this wild theory but Marris is now in the mood to rewatch the movie and do a deep dive to see if it tracks or not. This led into a childhood trauma movie look through like how \u003cem>The Land Before Time\u003c/em> made Marris cry and how \u003cem>Charlotte's Web\u003c/em> did Angi in. Mother of the Year Taylor then forgot (see: drunk) that \u003cem>Charlotte's Web\u003c/em> was so bad and showed it to her four year old daughter and it was the first time she cried from a movie. After announcing she's the worst parent ever (spot on) Angi also mentioned how the flying monkey's and The Wicked Witch from \u003cem>The Wizard of Oz\u003c/em> terrified her so you can see how well adjusted we are on this show.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Next up, we looked at some of the top words states struggle with and had a spelling bee with Marris. Prior to this of course, Angi had to unleash another trauma. When she was in fourth grade, she was the only one picked for her school's spelling bee as a representative and as usual, she bombed hard. Wanting to win the Encyclopedia Britannica set so badly, Angi confidently took to the stage and got her first word &quot;noisy.&quot; She froze, freaked out and then spelled it &quot;N O I S E Y.&quot; Needless to say, she was laughed out of the building (oh look, said it anyway.) Since she can't spell, she decided to see if Marris could while also showcasing 11 state's stupidity.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>California - &quot;pretty&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>New Mexico - &quot;quiet&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>North Dakota - &quot;secret&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Kansas - &quot;chaos&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oklahoma - &quot;animal&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Michigan - &quot;cousin&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ohio - &quot;equal&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tennessee - &quot;field&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maine - &quot;heard&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wisconsin - &quot;ally&quot; (Marris spelled it ... WRONG!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Virginia - &quot;said&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>So, Marris is not smarter than a fourth grader and now joins Angi in the hall of misspelled words next to &quot;noisy.&quot; Angi was so upset by her blunder, she hasn't used the word since. Also learned during this, Utah can't spell &quot;Mississippi&quot; and Maryland can't spell &quot;Pennsylvania.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, we took one more swipe at Marris to end the morning by discussing people who complain about how busy they are. Apparently, research has shown that people who complain about work and how busy they are, are less competent and likeable. This is weird because Marris is clearly beloved here at iHeart when all he does is complain about his 11 jobs. This research though was directed more at the people who are not truly overwhelmed and do what is referred to as &quot;stress bragging.&quot; Marris, as Angi pointed out, does this all the time. It's the constant need to reiterate how busy they are, the lack of free time and just how stressed they always are. Apparently, &quot;stress bragging&quot; is just bad for the overall work culture. Honestly though, Marris is actually busy, he does have 18 jobs and that's how he won a trip to anywhere in the world. In fact, he just finalized the trip and will be going solo to Tanzania once he lets the bosses know. Actually, that will be in September and it will be two weeks so we're going to start auditioning co-hosts to hold the fort with her while he is away. Benefits include little pay and getting to hang out with Angi, which will probably cause you to lose an entire head of guido hair from stress like Jay the Straight did. Angi was shocked that Marris is not gray and bald from stress yet though it is seeping in little by little as she bitches at him daily.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Request Wars 3.5\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Theme: A Jay the Gay Birthday Battle\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Current Champion: Angi (4x)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Angi's Song Choice: “Shame&quot; by Stabbing Westward\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris' Song Choice: &quot;The Shower Scene&quot; by Ice Nine Kills\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Winner: Angi\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>10 O' Clock Toast\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Toastee: Jay the Gay\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After taking a preemptive roast shot at Angi and Marris in my call segment, I was given a birthday roast by the roadies and Angi and Marris.

However, since Tuesday this week is our Monday, it only makes sense that we discussed people being more negative the older they get this morning. Marris completely understands it as people tend to get angry over adulting which makes sense as I'm so mad about being an adult. As for when you should expect the rage to take over, it apparently starts at 42 (which means Marris is ahead of the curve.) According to those polled though, 26% said they remained positive as they aged and 5% found themselves getting more negative. Using advanced mathematics or something, they landed on the age of 42 being the trigger for the decline into being mad bro. Marris' viewpoint was that at 42 and everything after, you have to be more responsible and plan for the future, which is awful. Factor in the price of gas, concert tickets and groceries being so expensive and you have your cocktail recipe for big mad. You hit 40 and even though it is a milestone, you need to sit down and start considering retirement down the line and how to survive that. In other words, life sucks and you realize it at 42. That said, there is actually a list of the 10 things people are most irritated about and without further adieu, here you go:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>10. TV Volume Is TOO LOUD!!!! - Angi questioned this one off the bat but Marris got it as he lives in a condo and the TV show volume is low and a commercial comes on and blows out the speakers. Angi did have a trick to fix the ratio but she lost the article (like we lost our phones for a moment) and explained that her surround sound makes the explosions so loud that they shake Floptopia and causes Jay the Straight to yell at her.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>9. Listening to Music You Don't Like - I mean, you're on Rock 95.5, that's a non issue here.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>8. Tipping Culture - Marris has a ton of different feelings on this. Angi loved London since tips and tax were included in the bill overall. Marris realized he may need to side tip in Tanzania.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>7. Social Media Trends - It's hard to keep track of all that nonsense when you're an adult with a life.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6. Customer Service - Angi agrees with this and says it is absolute hell. You call someone, you get India, you get 4 people to get where you need to be, it sucks. Marris just wants an option for talking to a representative right off the bat, none of these 25 buttons to get where you need to go garbage.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>5. The Weather - Eh, not that big of a deal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>4. Crowds - Another Angi eh but Marris said it depends on if it's surprise crowds or not.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>3. Others Driving - Yep\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>2. Politicians - Oh yeah\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>1. Grocery Prices - Marris had a fit at this one. Angi said when you check your finance pit chart and see how much you spend on food, you might have a stroke. She feels like she's feeding an army (wait til you see her liquor store bill.) Marris said comparing items to four years ago showcases how the price is higher and the packages are smaller. Angi added that healthy food is way too expensive. (So it seems this being number 1 makes sense, they were heated.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Also on the list was concert ticket prices, AI, computer issues, tech billionaires, parking, and movies being too dark these days.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As stated above (and now you're below,) the whole show had covid last week so we took a surprise staycation. Correction, the studio crew took a staycation, I was saved from a fourth trip to covid town and I spent my five days knee deep in Captain Morgan. Anyway, it all came about when Angi got a Death Note in the studio, found herself stuffy and by the time she got home after the show, felt even worse. The test confirmed it and one by one they dropped with Marris next, then HP and a handful of the pigeons next door. This meant we missed the chance to discuss our favorite topic on the show, cicadas. Roadie Lee called in to mention he drank four bottles of cicada Malört and did cicada shots. Apparently, he didn't bother with the brewer made ones and simply was just grabbing live cicadas in the yard and just throwing them down with the shots. All this talk of alcoholism and cicadas made Angi a bit mad because she has yet to see any cicadas yet. Prison Tattoo is in the same boat and Marris, king of cicada extermination, has only seen one so far but by his mother and brother, there are tons. Angi vaguely doxxed herself by saying where she lives a block from and is upset the place is not filled with them though if there were tons, she would also not leave her house. Since we were on the topic of Malört and cicadas though, Marris explained he was actually excited to try the double down disgusting brew until he saw a cicada in person yesterday and then his mind changed real quick. After all, you're already drinking something that tastes like burning tires that were stewed in a toilet, a bug only adds to the gross effect of it. We did discover though that while he's turned off from the boozing and has done a terrible job of spotting the plague, he did run a hotline while sidelined with covid to help others who were being swarmed by them. So what we took away from this cicada talk 2024 session is that Angi is suffering cicada FOMO and Marris was gung ho to chow down on them until he actually saw one and now he's back to setting trees on fire.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Onward we went to the Daily Discussion Topic which had no inspiration other than great music this morning. Have you ever heard of a &quot;No Skip Trip?&quot; This is a term used for an album that is so good that you listen to it from start to finish without skipping a single song. Angi offered that there aren't many these days but back in the day, there were tons of them. Marris offered that most artists tend to offer singles and push them more than albums nowadays as that's how the music business works now so we are conditioned for songs over albums. Marris kicked us off with a few of his choices including &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park along with &quot;Hybrid Theory.&quot; Toss in &quot;White Pony&quot; by Deftones and &quot;Infinity on High&quot; from Fall Out Boy and you have yourself a solid little list. Angi's choices included &quot;Hysteria&quot; by Def Leppard which she had on cassette (remember those kids,) &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince, Boston's &quot;Boston&quot; album and Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall.&quot; This also led us down memory lane as Angi recalled going to see Laser Floyd high as a kite and after the show, she bought Girl Scout cookies outside the venue. My choices were American Football &quot;American Football,&quot; Brand New &quot;Deja Entendu,&quot; Interpol &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; and Fleetwood Mac &quot;Rumours&quot; as well as &quot;White Pony&quot; as Marris chose. Before we hit the Request Line, we scooped a couple from the show's Facebook page/group including Metallica's &quot;Black&quot; album, Stone Temple Pilots &quot;Core,&quot; Fleetwood Mac &quot;Rumours,&quot; and Van Halen &quot;II.&quot; Over on the Request Line (which par for the course exploded at the end of the segment,) we started with Adam. He picked &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and was talking to us through a pillow. He just likes to roll a fatty and let loose. Ken picked &quot;II&quot; by Led Zeppelin and also was on the roll a fatty and let go train. Nick said &quot;Toxicity&quot; by System of a Down. Sam picked Breaking Benjamin but went with everything they've ever done, every song is a banger. If pressed though, the band's number one fan would choose &quot;Phobia.&quot; Head Roadie Keith chose &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; by Metallica. Jason said &quot;Them&quot; by King Diamond is great because it's a storyline to indulge in. If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, graduation season is upon us and someone with 3 kids who graduated high school back to back to back is sick of it. They are outright saying graduation is a waste of time and is somewhat of a hassle. Angi offered that with the robes, the summer heat, the hundreds of names called up, it actually could make some sense. If you really think about it, why is graduation really such a big deal? You are forced to go to school and then after this glitzy ceremony and a party, the rude awakening of reality hits you in the head that adulthood is nothing like what you endured. There is no celebration for going to work, paying your taxes, paying your child support or not going to jail (though all that would be fire to get a party for.) Marris agrees with the idea of it being a waste of time but he likes the process overall. He feels like if it was modernized, it would be better. Keep it going faster, move it along because when there's 500 kids, it takes FOREVER. Marris was in a class of 700, so he gets it, as once the name was done, you goofed off the rest of the time. He suggested it be broken down like college does it so you're not sitting through 10,000 people and are grouped more by study. The reality is that everyone is just tired so any kind of relief is just necessary honestly.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Don't Kill Angi Weekly Recap (5/20 - 5/22)\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mon: Angi wanted to become a kleptomaniac\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Choice: John had Angi decide to steal all the brown liquor at a restaurant.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Result: Inspired after discussing stealing on the show that morning, Angi's fiery kleptomania side was reignited and she needed to steal something that afternoon. She had settled on taking all the brown liquor she could fit into a trash bag from the restaurant she was going to for a Angi Taylor Show catch up lunch. With the bag hidden in her purse, Angi went off to the chosen restaurant and enjoyed her meal of 3 celery sticks and 14 margaritas. Once the meal was finished and everyone was content to leave, Marris called for the check and was astounded at how big it was. While Marris dealt with the sticker shock, Angi excused herself and made her way to the liquor wall and began her Grinch style pilfering. Once the bag was filled to the brim and almost too heavy to carry, Angi made her way to the exit. It seemed to be going so well and no one noticed that she was sneaking out with the entire liquor wall. However, as she was halfway out, a ton of sirens began to go off inside the eatery. It turned out the owner was a fan of the show and had overheard her plan to rob the store dry and so he air tagged every single bottle. Caught red handed and with police already on scene waiting to arrest her, Angi was taken away in handcuffs and tossed in the slammer. Unfortunately for her, the lunch bill was so high no one had any extra cash to bail her out.

For a reason that only made sense to her, Angi wanted to do a Titanic reenactment, complete with on site role play. This meant that Angi made her way out to the North Atlantic and really attempted to make it as real as possible. While in a tugboat, Angi took the reins and played &quot;dodge the icebergs.&quot; Navigating the frozen waters, she was doing pretty well but after looking down at her phone for a moment, someone on the deck yelled out &quot;iceberg ahead!&quot; By the time she looked back up, collision was inevitable and so the tugboat crashed into the massive ice wall, causing the boat to sink. Luckily for Angi, due to global warming, there were a ton of mini icebergs that lead to an ice shelf she could be rescued from. She jumped from mini iceberg to mini iceberg like she was playing hopscotch but as she did, an all too familiar sound arose. Completely unexpected but should have been since any time she is near water, it was Sven, the North Atlantic Saltwater Larping Shark! As Angi went to take another leap across the ice, Sven jumped out of the water and bit Angi in half.

Her first suspect was Walt, who had access, motive and incentive to bump her off (her corner spot.) Angi fished two beta blockers out of her purse and went to find Walt, who was ironically wandering the halls. Producing the cards, Angi threw them at Walt and gave the bad cop routine. &quot;Hey Walt, did you leave these scary messages for me? Is this some kind of sick joke?!&quot; Walt didn't bother to rebuttal, instead smirking and laughing in Angi's face. Reaching behind his back, he pulled out a third black envelope and handed it to Angi. Upon opening it, she read it aloud &quot;588-2300 Empire Today&quot; along with &quot;Today Bitch.&quot; Enraged that he would think something so stupid was funny but more so because he decided to prank the HBIC, Angi reached behind her back. She produced a machete which she then used to hack off both of Walt's arms before proceeding to his legs and when he was just a stump, she took off his head.

However, this morning was a bit different, almost ominous as Angi came into her designated studio spot to find two envelopes. Normally, we'd assume it was just her hush money payments or her cut from the pigeon kidnappings that were made to make sure her neighbors pigeons win the upcoming races. However, the black envelopes did not contain anything fun like cash or anthrax but instead had 2 menacing cards in them. The first envelope said &quot;Adios Brochacho&quot; which is weird because that is a total &quot;Angi Taylor Statement.&quot; (Much like Angi Taylor Money, we attach her name to things to showcase importance and her owning them.) As for the inside, it was a card with a casket on it that said &quot;Let Me Rest in Peace.&quot; That was it, no name, no indication who it was from, just that. The second envelope said &quot;Til the End&quot; on it and the card inside said &quot;Life, although it only may be an accumulation of anguish, it is dear to me just like you.&quot; Obviously, the first thought was that iHeart has given up on pizza party firings and this was now how they intend to get rid of us. Marris chimed in that he'd rather receive a severance than a casket though caskets are expensive and he could probably sell it off for some cash. As everyone should know, Angi is always in full time panic mode and she pointed out that if her husband or boss even texts her &quot;call me,&quot; she goes into meltdown mode. In her head, she goes off the tracks and assumes that she is going to be fired, that Floptopia has collapsed on itself or that her husband has finally had enough and he's checking out. Needless to say, things like this freak her out so to have this happen this morning was not ideal. She's not sure who left the cards and if the situation is bait that they set up so she would discuss it on air but she is not amused. The problem of course is that the studio is shared with a ton of people but since her spot is centered away from others, this was a direct message from her and not an accidental left behind Uncrustable that she ate that one time. As of writing this, we did not know what it meant and she is clearly not okay with not knowing what it is all about. Angi decided that an investigation is going to occur and I'm assuming that we are about to become the Scooby Doo gang (Marris: Fred, Angi: Daphne, Prison Tattoo: Shaggy, HP: Velma, Myself: Scooby Doo.) So look forward to the coming days to see if we can figure this out or if Angi ends up worrying so much that she has a stroke.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Now, it's kind of ironic that Angi had this Daily Discussion Topic prepped for today with all that is going on but you know how this show is, we're always one step ahead of everyone else (and three steps behind in life.) So, Angi has a thing where she likes to go into celebrities' iTunes when they come in to get a feel for the music they like. This ahead of the trend action came up recently in a Bon Jovi interview where he revealed some of the songs on his playlist and what they mean to him. For example, &quot;Born to Run&quot; by Bruce Springsteen is a song that changed his life. He wished he had written &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; by Don Henley. As for a song to be played at a party, he went with a vanity choice of &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; for a song to be played at a party and there was an agreement in the studio that people go nuts when they hear it anywhere. It was his funeral song that became our absolute focus as he chose &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; by Wham which was ironic using wake me up, when I'm dead. That led to our question for the roadies, what is your funeral song? Marris' song was not in the system so he opted for &quot;In the End&quot; by Linkin Park because it combines keeping his memory alive while also jamming out. Angi, as stated plenty of times, wants a celebration of life and not a funeral. As we all know, they burn witches at the stake so cremation is her way to go out. Plus, this lets everyone remember her as young and hot and not the sagging old mess that she is now. As for her memorial song, it will be &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince and when it's played, she wants every man around the world to don a black armband for a month and they need to wander the city and mourn. This goes for mascots as well, all of them. As for my pick, I want &quot;Growing Sideways' by Noah Kahan because it feels fitting. With our playlist firmly cemented, we went to the Request Line to get some roadie addons. Aaron picked &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; by Queen because he wants to go out on a high note. Mike had a perfect pairing by Alice in Chains by using &quot;Man in the Box&quot; at his wake and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; at the funeral. Karalee wants &quot;Stranglehold&quot; by Ted Nugent. Carrie's mom wanted &quot;Grenade&quot; by Bruno Mars played for her and it may have had something to do with animosity toward her husband. Nick is literally going out in style by using &quot;Going Out in Style&quot; by the Dropkick Murphys as he feels it's a celebration of life. Zack chose &quot;Where Eagles Fly&quot; by Sammy Hagar because it was his dad who passed away several years ago favorite song and it felt they would be together in the sky in the afterlife. Marty chose a sad yet positive song in &quot;Remember We Die&quot; by Gemini Syndrome. If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Moving away from death and onto money, which tends to be the leading cause of death sometimes (people stressing over it, not having enough, etc.) We didn't even need to reach delusional portions for this cash introduction as we started with a question. If Marris was to drop something in a urinal, would he fish it out? If it was a phone, definitely. Even with all the piss on it, he would throw it in rice and let it get soaked out while he lysoled everything. Angi's question had to do with a penny though, a singular penny. Marris said no way but if it was paper money then totally (sounds right to me.) A poll was conducted about a target practice penny and 62 men (13%) said they would take it. Marris was rightfully disgusted and wondered why anyone would consider it. Outside of it being like a penny collector or the penny being a special edition one that was worth $100, they belong in the trash. Dude's polled said they would take paper money even though that is gross which led to Marris revealing he will sometimes put paper money in his mouth!!! (BRB crying, screaming, throwing up) The point is that if you see free money, you take it if it is worthwhile even if Angi is against it. Since we have to always end off the rails, Angi wondered what men do in the bathroom. She saw fellow iHeart employee and \u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkiss.fm%2F&data=05%7C02%7CChristopherLeach%40iheartmedia.com%7C03d941e21d454991c04a08dc7a724448%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C638519878397083296%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=VTN%2BC3C80e7LAocjKZXw6OlTDxoMEgkuj1m3apypyYg%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">KISS.FM\u003c/a> guy Jason Brown go in with Marris and wondered if Jason Brown had taken a peek at Marris' meat monster. She's betting he has and Marris, well, Marris needs to consider this thought now.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, if you have trouble getting dressed in the morning, perhaps you should consider the Tiktok &quot;Sandwich Method.&quot; This means that you match the shoes to your shirt and the pants can be whatever as they are the meat. When Marris dresses, it's usually the hat first and then it trickles down. Sometimes he will match shirt to hat and not care from there. Angi does the shirt first and then matches the shoes to it. Basically, if it works, just go with it. On the flip, you can also match jeans to your hat and make the shirt the meat. See, Angi is a fashionista so everything must be perfect in her presence or you'll get the chop. You seek to create balance and not be too matchy matchy. Angi then gave the business to anyone who mixes labels like ADIDAS track pants and a Nike shirt. We came to hear that Marris does that sometimes and if she saw him with ADIDAS and Puma together, she would send the fashion police after him (I think those are the Queer Eye people.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Request Wars 3.5\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Theme: Rock and Metal Songs with a Billion Streams\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Current Champion: Angi (2x)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Angi's Song Choice: “Chop Suey&quot; System of a Down\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris' Song Choice: &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Winner: Angi\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>10 O' Clock Toast\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Toastee: Perry Farrell\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris and Angi had a covid date (they don't have it, they just watched the same documentary at their own houses at the same time,) watching\u003cem> Lolla: The Story of Lollapalooza\u003c/em> on Paramount Plus last night.

To hear everything that happened, check out the podcast of today's show. However, if you're looking for a quick read along with random self inserts and my personal thoughts, you've come to the right place.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Call in Point\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>(This is the broadstroke canvas on which I base my call, obviously these notes are going to be longer and more detailed.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Now, before I go into the nonsense that was today's show, I should probably plaster a giant disclaimer here. We are basically idiots and taking advice from us is not the most smartest (points if you know where that phrase comes from) idea. However, in some rare moments, we find our way toward the light and offer up pieces of knowledge that are worth indulging in. This happened to be the case when Angi mined some nuggets from Instagram prophets who divulge outdated sayings as if it is some form of sound wisdom (it's not.) These common phrases are on the way out and in turn, we offered a fresh coat of paint for them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Don't Go to Bed Angry&quot; - Better idea, don't listen to this because it's dumb. In some situations, as Angi explained, you need a new perspective and a fresh brain to look at everything in a new light. Marris followed that conceding by walking away and sleeping it out is sometimes the right idea. Not every problem can/should be resolved before bed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Never Give Up&quot; - The reality is sometimes things are just not bound to work out and you need to let them go.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Ignore a Bully&quot; - Nope, sometimes the situation calls for a punch in the face and if they have it coming, don't feel afraid to swing and not miss.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Don't Be Afraid to Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow.&quot; - While this could be true, it also can be a source of trouble and is entirely circumstantial and should not dictate making better decisions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Tough It Out&quot; - This is not always true, some relationships need to end, some friendships need to dissolve. You should not be afraid to cut the cord.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; - This is a mixed bag because there is partial correctness here. Depending on the situation, forgiveness should be given. However, like an elephant, you should never forget. Poor behaviors tend to pattern and should be watched out for and usually continue. Forgiving someone means you can keep them in your life but it doesn't mean to trust them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Treat People the Way You Want to Be Treated&quot; - Flip the script on this one, treat people the way they treat you.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Trust Your Gut&quot; While this can be empowering, anxiety and issues can work against you and make your gut instinct wrong and in cases like Angi, make you indecisive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Here's one final one straight from new LARPer Angi's mouth that is correct: &quot;Booze Before Before, in the Clear. Beer Before Booze, You Lose.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Though the recurring theme today was cheating, it was also cheating that brought us (and by us I mean Angi and our own collective amusement,) into the wonderful (see: nerd, loser, dork) world of LARPing. After talking to roadie Paul, who dressed up like a male fairy (fairy is a non binary word,) to appease the woman he was cheating on his ex wife with. As you probably should have guessed/expected/known, Angi was completely enthralled with LARPing after that and she went about attempting to learn all she could about it. Now, this is a pulled together piece of ideas because I could discuss Angi watching LARPing porn with Marris but again, that was to be expected. Upon understanding what LARPing is and avoiding an aneurysm, Angi decided that she may want to LARP. Her first idea was Jake from State Farm but she switched it up to the more proper Ann Boleyn. Now, she was unsure if she had sword skills but she did ride her horse like a whore (with her thighs, none of that side saddle nonsense,) and so shoe/fits, etc. As I said above, Angi went on Pornhub during commercial and song breaks and also played us a snippet of an orgy on air (minus the fun sex) but I am proud to say the roadies did offer her costume ideas on the Request Line. She was told to do \u003cem>Game of Thrones\u003c/em>, Fembot, \u003cem>Vikings\u003c/em> character Lagertha the ShieldMaiden, The Devil and April O'Neil. That last was dismissed only because she would ruin the fantasy for Marris. We capped our LARP adventure (in this section, it continued to seep into the show,) which Angi learning that LARPing meetups may not have a lot of hot guys but if she drinks enough mead, she could get them up a notch. Unfortunately, she spent most of her life doing that so I don't think it will work.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Right, getting away from LARPing and jumping right back into the place where this whole LARPing mess started, we have a Daily Discussion Topic about cheating. Now, we all know the famous story of Angi's boyfriend who ate the napkin with another girl's phone number on it. While this isn't as silly as her story, a woman discovered her husband was cheating when she had to take her dog to the vet. The female vet discussed the surreal experience when she watched in real time what happened when she saved the dog's life because it had something tangled up in its intestines. It turns out that was a thong that the dog ate that belonged to the woman her husband was cheating with. Instead of doing it in person, the mess was done over the phone in the vet's office which probably made her showing her the expensive surgery bill even more awkward. The dog ended up being okay but the marriage pretty much died that day. Now, Marris does not have anything to contribute to this topic as he has never been cheated on (that he knows of) because as Angi put it &quot;he lays it down good and a girl wouldn't dream of giving that up.&quot; However, the roadies on the Request Line did have some wild ways of showcasing how they discovered cheating. We began with Paul, who would end up derailing the whole show, who told us that he cheated on his wife. She discovered it when she found his LARPing costume, a male fairy, because the girl he was seeing was into fairy erotica. He kept tights and a tunic in his truck and one day, she stumbled upon them. It technically had a happy ending I guess because he stayed with the fairy princess after he divorced his wife. Jeffery told a very long roundabout story so I'm going to trim it down some. Basically, he is a utility worker and has a company truck and his car. His girl at the time was a hairdresser. After a back and forth of him attempting to see her and get a trim, she said she had to take her mother to the emergency room. He went home, saw his car she was using there and after going in and calling around for her, found the man she had a child with prior coming down the stairs in his PJ's. Instead of punching, they figured out she was double dipping. Tom's ex wife said she was going to the tanning salon and explained coming home looking like a sweaty mess on it. A week later he found spray tan and realized she was going out banging. Pamela was six months pregnant and making a baby blanket when women's intuition willed her to the first floor of her house to literally see the guy she was with sticking his hands down the pants of another girl who was staying with them for some reason (it wasn't abundantly clear.) If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, Angi brought up the recently released Ashley Madison documentary and mentioned how not only is cheating rampant but there have been a list of hot spots released to showcase where it is most abundant. While Marris assumed Naperville would make the list, Angi pointed out they were famous for swingers. So, where are the actual places? Glad you asked, here's the top 20.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>1. Columbus, Ohio\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>2. Miami, Florida,\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>3. Orlando, Florida\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>4. Las Vegas, Nevada\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>5. Atlanta, Georgia\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6.

Seeing his crush dance to his band’s music and realizing its power → 4. Crawling around on the floor on his mom’s Persian rug, and realizing that the complex patterns were exactly what music was all about for him, a mix of wildness and order in a strange tension. → 5. Going to boarding school in the UK, and realizing the power of music in church → 6. His musical influences of both reggae and Baladi rhythm → 7. Managing conflict in The Police, and finding the value in band therapy.\n\nRecruiting Sting and Andy Summers in 1977, Stewart Copeland is renowned as the founder of The Police, a band that became a defining force in rock music from the ‘80s through to the present day. His career includes the sale of more than 60 million records worldwide, and numerous awards, including five GRAMMY awards.

Pawning her wedding ring and selling her car to pay for recording at Sun Studios in Memphis, making the record, and then pitching it to every label and no interest for a year, until eventually Jack White’s Third Man Records picked it up → 5.

In just three remarkable solo albums, the singer and songwriter has cemented herself as a force in American music and a generational talent. A deserving critical darling, she has never shied away from the sounds that move her, the pain that’s shaped her, or the topics that tick her off, like music industry double standards, the gender wage gap, or the plight of the American farmer (in 2021, she even joined the board of Farm Aid). While the last few years have seen remarkable moments of acclaim – a Best New Artist GRAMMY nomination, Americana Music Honors, a Saturday Night Live performance, and just about every outlet and critics’ year-end Best Of list – Price is still hungry. On her fourth full-length Strays, a clear-eyed mission statement delivered in blistering rock and roll, she’s taking on substance abuse, self-image, abortion rights, and orgasms. Musically extravagant but lyrically laser focused, the 10-song record tears into a broken world desperate for remedy. And who better to tell it? Price has been to the mountain and back, but finds herself, at long last, free. Feral.

Before she could open the trauma can though, she attempted to enable some nerd news (which kind of led into the childhood trauma Daily Discussion Topic) by talking about a naked man who was arrested after climbing a bumblebee statue in New Mexico. The thing was, she assumed it was Transformers being discussed but in reality it was an actual bumblebee that the man was swinging dong from. As usual, we don't do research on this show because that would involve effort. Anyway, another guy was also arrested recently but instead of waving his magic wand, he used the product of his to drive him home. A kid and his drunk dad were pulled over after his pickup truck ran off the street, onto a sidewalk and over some traffic cones. The 14 year old was behind the wheel and in the passenger seat was John Storms, the kids father who was litty kitty and instructed him on how to drive. After getting out of the car, the father did a little dance in the street and was promptly arrested for several different things including public drunkeness, etc. Funny enough, Angi also drunk drove her father at 14 and though she was probably lit on wine coolers, her long and tall gangly limbs were able to hit the pedals and get them back to the house without issue. She probably could have died but if the 600 other ailments that she currently has haven't taken her out yet, driving at 14 surely wasn't going to do it. Another time, her stepfather picked her up from school when she was a kid and went straight to the bar. He proceeded to drink for 4 or 5 hours and had her sit in the backseat, which was cold and told her to do her homework. As usual, at crappy life poker, Angi always has some variation of trump cards. As for Marris, he brother was left in charge of him when he was an &quot;infantile.&quot; Apparently, Marris rolled off the bed and when his parents asked what happened, his brother matter of factly stated &quot;you told me to watch him and I watched him roll off the bed.&quot; How Marris, who again was &quot;infantile&quot; knows this story is due to the age old tradition of passing trauma stories down from family member to family member to laugh over at the dinner table. Normally, I'd add my own trauma stories here but it's my birthday and I'm upset enough about that already as is so instead, I'm going to just move right along to the roadies on the Request Line to hear about how their parents almost killed them. Brett was sick at 10 and she thought she had strep throat. Her parents ignored her and she got sicker and sicker, to the point she couldn't eat, sleep or drink and her throat was swollen. It turned out she had strep throat for two weeks and the doctor told her parents they were horrible people and that she could have died if they had waited another week. Richie's mom took him to the YMCA (you know you shimmied reading that) to learn how to swim. Her idea of this was throwing him in the water and letting him get back to her while she laughed with friends. Bob's dad had him trimming trees at 11 in some of the most questionable parenting I've heard in some time. Jennifer was 2 when her dad was carrying her around the living room drunk and he almost accidentally put her through a window but the family dog saved her. Mike's father was drunk (recurring theme here eh) and he was racing down a dead end street and the car ended up in a field where it flew like \u003cem>The Dukes of Hazzard\u003c/em>. John's dad did that thing where you tied a rope to a car and then to a sled and took it through the streets, which nowadays seems highly insane. Funny enough (one upper) Angi did that as a kid as well only when her dad rounded a corner, she flew into a parked car.

This perception shifter wrecked Angi's childhood (she was like 60 when that movie came out so let's play make believe.) Apparently, the barracuda that was blamed for the loss of Nemo's mother and all his siblings was not the cause of the mass extinction event. It turns out that Mrs. Vorhees was the kille...wait, wrong movie. Nemo's mother was the culprit because in actual life, female clownfish tend to eat their eggs and barracudas do not. So the death that swept the ocean that day was triggered by mother clown fish (who then went on to get eaten or something, this part was unclear.) The point is that Nemo only lived due to sheer luck or maybe because she was too full. Had she lived though, there is a good chance she would have probably eaten Nemo as well. While Angi's therapist put her calls to voicemail, she continued on how Coral was just an absolute bitch. See, marine biologists showcased that female clown fish eat their young while the males tend to them. Though the males will eat damaged eggs/kids and during the first few attempts, the parents will end up eating all the eggs for fun. This underwater horror story also has an even darker tone in that Nemo may have not actually existed. See, another swing showcased that Nemo may have been eaten and simply never existed and the whole movie is a hallucinated fever dream. After all, Nemo translates to &quot;nobody.&quot; That's right, you were actually watching Finding Nobody! Basically, Tiktok is out to ruin your childhood by showcasing the true horrors of nature and these reveals were blowing Marris' mind. Then again, all the Disney movies were kind of sinister. \u003cem>Bambi\u003c/em>, \u003cem>The Lion King\u003c/em>, \u003cem>Dumbo\u003c/em>, dead parents about with built in childhood traumas. It's almost like Disney writers were all high on acid or shroomed out and decided to really screw us up (and then benefit later by making PTSD-addled adults love their parks.) Obviously, Pixar won't confirm this wild theory but Marris is now in the mood to rewatch the movie and do a deep dive to see if it tracks or not. This led into a childhood trauma movie look through like how \u003cem>The Land Before Time\u003c/em> made Marris cry and how \u003cem>Charlotte's Web\u003c/em> did Angi in. Mother of the Year Taylor then forgot (see: drunk) that \u003cem>Charlotte's Web\u003c/em> was so bad and showed it to her four year old daughter and it was the first time she cried from a movie. After announcing she's the worst parent ever (spot on) Angi also mentioned how the flying monkey's and The Wicked Witch from \u003cem>The Wizard of Oz\u003c/em> terrified her so you can see how well adjusted we are on this show.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Next up, we looked at some of the top words states struggle with and had a spelling bee with Marris. Prior to this of course, Angi had to unleash another trauma. When she was in fourth grade, she was the only one picked for her school's spelling bee as a representative and as usual, she bombed hard. Wanting to win the Encyclopedia Britannica set so badly, Angi confidently took to the stage and got her first word &quot;noisy.&quot; She froze, freaked out and then spelled it &quot;N O I S E Y.&quot; Needless to say, she was laughed out of the building (oh look, said it anyway.) Since she can't spell, she decided to see if Marris could while also showcasing 11 state's stupidity.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>California - &quot;pretty&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>New Mexico - &quot;quiet&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>North Dakota - &quot;secret&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Kansas - &quot;chaos&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oklahoma - &quot;animal&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Michigan - &quot;cousin&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ohio - &quot;equal&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tennessee - &quot;field&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maine - &quot;heard&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wisconsin - &quot;ally&quot; (Marris spelled it ... WRONG!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Virginia - &quot;said&quot; (Marris spelled it ... correct!)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>So, Marris is not smarter than a fourth grader and now joins Angi in the hall of misspelled words next to &quot;noisy.&quot; Angi was so upset by her blunder, she hasn't used the word since. Also learned during this, Utah can't spell &quot;Mississippi&quot; and Maryland can't spell &quot;Pennsylvania.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, we took one more swipe at Marris to end the morning by discussing people who complain about how busy they are. Apparently, research has shown that people who complain about work and how busy they are, are less competent and likeable. This is weird because Marris is clearly beloved here at iHeart when all he does is complain about his 11 jobs. This research though was directed more at the people who are not truly overwhelmed and do what is referred to as &quot;stress bragging.&quot; Marris, as Angi pointed out, does this all the time. It's the constant need to reiterate how busy they are, the lack of free time and just how stressed they always are. Apparently, &quot;stress bragging&quot; is just bad for the overall work culture. Honestly though, Marris is actually busy, he does have 18 jobs and that's how he won a trip to anywhere in the world. In fact, he just finalized the trip and will be going solo to Tanzania once he lets the bosses know. Actually, that will be in September and it will be two weeks so we're going to start auditioning co-hosts to hold the fort with her while he is away. Benefits include little pay and getting to hang out with Angi, which will probably cause you to lose an entire head of guido hair from stress like Jay the Straight did. Angi was shocked that Marris is not gray and bald from stress yet though it is seeping in little by little as she bitches at him daily.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Request Wars 3.5\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Theme: A Jay the Gay Birthday Battle\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Current Champion: Angi (4x)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Angi's Song Choice: “Shame&quot; by Stabbing Westward\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris' Song Choice: &quot;The Shower Scene&quot; by Ice Nine Kills\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Winner: Angi\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>10 O' Clock Toast\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Toastee: Jay the Gay\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After taking a preemptive roast shot at Angi and Marris in my call segment, I was given a birthday roast by the roadies and Angi and Marris.

However, since Tuesday this week is our Monday, it only makes sense that we discussed people being more negative the older they get this morning. Marris completely understands it as people tend to get angry over adulting which makes sense as I'm so mad about being an adult. As for when you should expect the rage to take over, it apparently starts at 42 (which means Marris is ahead of the curve.) According to those polled though, 26% said they remained positive as they aged and 5% found themselves getting more negative. Using advanced mathematics or something, they landed on the age of 42 being the trigger for the decline into being mad bro. Marris' viewpoint was that at 42 and everything after, you have to be more responsible and plan for the future, which is awful. Factor in the price of gas, concert tickets and groceries being so expensive and you have your cocktail recipe for big mad. You hit 40 and even though it is a milestone, you need to sit down and start considering retirement down the line and how to survive that. In other words, life sucks and you realize it at 42. That said, there is actually a list of the 10 things people are most irritated about and without further adieu, here you go:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>10. TV Volume Is TOO LOUD!!!! - Angi questioned this one off the bat but Marris got it as he lives in a condo and the TV show volume is low and a commercial comes on and blows out the speakers. Angi did have a trick to fix the ratio but she lost the article (like we lost our phones for a moment) and explained that her surround sound makes the explosions so loud that they shake Floptopia and causes Jay the Straight to yell at her.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>9. Listening to Music You Don't Like - I mean, you're on Rock 95.5, that's a non issue here.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>8. Tipping Culture - Marris has a ton of different feelings on this. Angi loved London since tips and tax were included in the bill overall. Marris realized he may need to side tip in Tanzania.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>7. Social Media Trends - It's hard to keep track of all that nonsense when you're an adult with a life.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6. Customer Service - Angi agrees with this and says it is absolute hell. You call someone, you get India, you get 4 people to get where you need to be, it sucks. Marris just wants an option for talking to a representative right off the bat, none of these 25 buttons to get where you need to go garbage.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>5. The Weather - Eh, not that big of a deal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>4. Crowds - Another Angi eh but Marris said it depends on if it's surprise crowds or not.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>3. Others Driving - Yep\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>2. Politicians - Oh yeah\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>1. Grocery Prices - Marris had a fit at this one. Angi said when you check your finance pit chart and see how much you spend on food, you might have a stroke. She feels like she's feeding an army (wait til you see her liquor store bill.) Marris said comparing items to four years ago showcases how the price is higher and the packages are smaller. Angi added that healthy food is way too expensive. (So it seems this being number 1 makes sense, they were heated.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Also on the list was concert ticket prices, AI, computer issues, tech billionaires, parking, and movies being too dark these days.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As stated above (and now you're below,) the whole show had covid last week so we took a surprise staycation. Correction, the studio crew took a staycation, I was saved from a fourth trip to covid town and I spent my five days knee deep in Captain Morgan. Anyway, it all came about when Angi got a Death Note in the studio, found herself stuffy and by the time she got home after the show, felt even worse. The test confirmed it and one by one they dropped with Marris next, then HP and a handful of the pigeons next door. This meant we missed the chance to discuss our favorite topic on the show, cicadas. Roadie Lee called in to mention he drank four bottles of cicada Malört and did cicada shots. Apparently, he didn't bother with the brewer made ones and simply was just grabbing live cicadas in the yard and just throwing them down with the shots. All this talk of alcoholism and cicadas made Angi a bit mad because she has yet to see any cicadas yet. Prison Tattoo is in the same boat and Marris, king of cicada extermination, has only seen one so far but by his mother and brother, there are tons. Angi vaguely doxxed herself by saying where she lives a block from and is upset the place is not filled with them though if there were tons, she would also not leave her house. Since we were on the topic of Malört and cicadas though, Marris explained he was actually excited to try the double down disgusting brew until he saw a cicada in person yesterday and then his mind changed real quick. After all, you're already drinking something that tastes like burning tires that were stewed in a toilet, a bug only adds to the gross effect of it. We did discover though that while he's turned off from the boozing and has done a terrible job of spotting the plague, he did run a hotline while sidelined with covid to help others who were being swarmed by them. So what we took away from this cicada talk 2024 session is that Angi is suffering cicada FOMO and Marris was gung ho to chow down on them until he actually saw one and now he's back to setting trees on fire.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Onward we went to the Daily Discussion Topic which had no inspiration other than great music this morning. Have you ever heard of a &quot;No Skip Trip?&quot; This is a term used for an album that is so good that you listen to it from start to finish without skipping a single song. Angi offered that there aren't many these days but back in the day, there were tons of them. Marris offered that most artists tend to offer singles and push them more than albums nowadays as that's how the music business works now so we are conditioned for songs over albums. Marris kicked us off with a few of his choices including &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park along with &quot;Hybrid Theory.&quot; Toss in &quot;White Pony&quot; by Deftones and &quot;Infinity on High&quot; from Fall Out Boy and you have yourself a solid little list. Angi's choices included &quot;Hysteria&quot; by Def Leppard which she had on cassette (remember those kids,) &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince, Boston's &quot;Boston&quot; album and Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall.&quot; This also led us down memory lane as Angi recalled going to see Laser Floyd high as a kite and after the show, she bought Girl Scout cookies outside the venue. My choices were American Football &quot;American Football,&quot; Brand New &quot;Deja Entendu,&quot; Interpol &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; and Fleetwood Mac &quot;Rumours&quot; as well as &quot;White Pony&quot; as Marris chose. Before we hit the Request Line, we scooped a couple from the show's Facebook page/group including Metallica's &quot;Black&quot; album, Stone Temple Pilots &quot;Core,&quot; Fleetwood Mac &quot;Rumours,&quot; and Van Halen &quot;II.&quot; Over on the Request Line (which par for the course exploded at the end of the segment,) we started with Adam. He picked &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and was talking to us through a pillow. He just likes to roll a fatty and let loose. Ken picked &quot;II&quot; by Led Zeppelin and also was on the roll a fatty and let go train. Nick said &quot;Toxicity&quot; by System of a Down. Sam picked Breaking Benjamin but went with everything they've ever done, every song is a banger. If pressed though, the band's number one fan would choose &quot;Phobia.&quot; Head Roadie Keith chose &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; by Metallica. Jason said &quot;Them&quot; by King Diamond is great because it's a storyline to indulge in. If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, graduation season is upon us and someone with 3 kids who graduated high school back to back to back is sick of it. They are outright saying graduation is a waste of time and is somewhat of a hassle. Angi offered that with the robes, the summer heat, the hundreds of names called up, it actually could make some sense. If you really think about it, why is graduation really such a big deal? You are forced to go to school and then after this glitzy ceremony and a party, the rude awakening of reality hits you in the head that adulthood is nothing like what you endured. There is no celebration for going to work, paying your taxes, paying your child support or not going to jail (though all that would be fire to get a party for.) Marris agrees with the idea of it being a waste of time but he likes the process overall. He feels like if it was modernized, it would be better. Keep it going faster, move it along because when there's 500 kids, it takes FOREVER. Marris was in a class of 700, so he gets it, as once the name was done, you goofed off the rest of the time. He suggested it be broken down like college does it so you're not sitting through 10,000 people and are grouped more by study. The reality is that everyone is just tired so any kind of relief is just necessary honestly.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Don't Kill Angi Weekly Recap (5/20 - 5/22)\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mon: Angi wanted to become a kleptomaniac\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Choice: John had Angi decide to steal all the brown liquor at a restaurant.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Result: Inspired after discussing stealing on the show that morning, Angi's fiery kleptomania side was reignited and she needed to steal something that afternoon. She had settled on taking all the brown liquor she could fit into a trash bag from the restaurant she was going to for a Angi Taylor Show catch up lunch. With the bag hidden in her purse, Angi went off to the chosen restaurant and enjoyed her meal of 3 celery sticks and 14 margaritas. Once the meal was finished and everyone was content to leave, Marris called for the check and was astounded at how big it was. While Marris dealt with the sticker shock, Angi excused herself and made her way to the liquor wall and began her Grinch style pilfering. Once the bag was filled to the brim and almost too heavy to carry, Angi made her way to the exit. It seemed to be going so well and no one noticed that she was sneaking out with the entire liquor wall. However, as she was halfway out, a ton of sirens began to go off inside the eatery. It turned out the owner was a fan of the show and had overheard her plan to rob the store dry and so he air tagged every single bottle. Caught red handed and with police already on scene waiting to arrest her, Angi was taken away in handcuffs and tossed in the slammer. Unfortunately for her, the lunch bill was so high no one had any extra cash to bail her out.

For a reason that only made sense to her, Angi wanted to do a Titanic reenactment, complete with on site role play. This meant that Angi made her way out to the North Atlantic and really attempted to make it as real as possible. While in a tugboat, Angi took the reins and played &quot;dodge the icebergs.&quot; Navigating the frozen waters, she was doing pretty well but after looking down at her phone for a moment, someone on the deck yelled out &quot;iceberg ahead!&quot; By the time she looked back up, collision was inevitable and so the tugboat crashed into the massive ice wall, causing the boat to sink. Luckily for Angi, due to global warming, there were a ton of mini icebergs that lead to an ice shelf she could be rescued from. She jumped from mini iceberg to mini iceberg like she was playing hopscotch but as she did, an all too familiar sound arose. Completely unexpected but should have been since any time she is near water, it was Sven, the North Atlantic Saltwater Larping Shark! As Angi went to take another leap across the ice, Sven jumped out of the water and bit Angi in half.

Her first suspect was Walt, who had access, motive and incentive to bump her off (her corner spot.) Angi fished two beta blockers out of her purse and went to find Walt, who was ironically wandering the halls. Producing the cards, Angi threw them at Walt and gave the bad cop routine. &quot;Hey Walt, did you leave these scary messages for me? Is this some kind of sick joke?!&quot; Walt didn't bother to rebuttal, instead smirking and laughing in Angi's face. Reaching behind his back, he pulled out a third black envelope and handed it to Angi. Upon opening it, she read it aloud &quot;588-2300 Empire Today&quot; along with &quot;Today Bitch.&quot; Enraged that he would think something so stupid was funny but more so because he decided to prank the HBIC, Angi reached behind her back. She produced a machete which she then used to hack off both of Walt's arms before proceeding to his legs and when he was just a stump, she took off his head.

However, this morning was a bit different, almost ominous as Angi came into her designated studio spot to find two envelopes. Normally, we'd assume it was just her hush money payments or her cut from the pigeon kidnappings that were made to make sure her neighbors pigeons win the upcoming races. However, the black envelopes did not contain anything fun like cash or anthrax but instead had 2 menacing cards in them. The first envelope said &quot;Adios Brochacho&quot; which is weird because that is a total &quot;Angi Taylor Statement.&quot; (Much like Angi Taylor Money, we attach her name to things to showcase importance and her owning them.) As for the inside, it was a card with a casket on it that said &quot;Let Me Rest in Peace.&quot; That was it, no name, no indication who it was from, just that. The second envelope said &quot;Til the End&quot; on it and the card inside said &quot;Life, although it only may be an accumulation of anguish, it is dear to me just like you.&quot; Obviously, the first thought was that iHeart has given up on pizza party firings and this was now how they intend to get rid of us. Marris chimed in that he'd rather receive a severance than a casket though caskets are expensive and he could probably sell it off for some cash. As everyone should know, Angi is always in full time panic mode and she pointed out that if her husband or boss even texts her &quot;call me,&quot; she goes into meltdown mode. In her head, she goes off the tracks and assumes that she is going to be fired, that Floptopia has collapsed on itself or that her husband has finally had enough and he's checking out. Needless to say, things like this freak her out so to have this happen this morning was not ideal. She's not sure who left the cards and if the situation is bait that they set up so she would discuss it on air but she is not amused. The problem of course is that the studio is shared with a ton of people but since her spot is centered away from others, this was a direct message from her and not an accidental left behind Uncrustable that she ate that one time. As of writing this, we did not know what it meant and she is clearly not okay with not knowing what it is all about. Angi decided that an investigation is going to occur and I'm assuming that we are about to become the Scooby Doo gang (Marris: Fred, Angi: Daphne, Prison Tattoo: Shaggy, HP: Velma, Myself: Scooby Doo.) So look forward to the coming days to see if we can figure this out or if Angi ends up worrying so much that she has a stroke.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Now, it's kind of ironic that Angi had this Daily Discussion Topic prepped for today with all that is going on but you know how this show is, we're always one step ahead of everyone else (and three steps behind in life.) So, Angi has a thing where she likes to go into celebrities' iTunes when they come in to get a feel for the music they like. This ahead of the trend action came up recently in a Bon Jovi interview where he revealed some of the songs on his playlist and what they mean to him. For example, &quot;Born to Run&quot; by Bruce Springsteen is a song that changed his life. He wished he had written &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; by Don Henley. As for a song to be played at a party, he went with a vanity choice of &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; for a song to be played at a party and there was an agreement in the studio that people go nuts when they hear it anywhere. It was his funeral song that became our absolute focus as he chose &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; by Wham which was ironic using wake me up, when I'm dead. That led to our question for the roadies, what is your funeral song? Marris' song was not in the system so he opted for &quot;In the End&quot; by Linkin Park because it combines keeping his memory alive while also jamming out. Angi, as stated plenty of times, wants a celebration of life and not a funeral. As we all know, they burn witches at the stake so cremation is her way to go out. Plus, this lets everyone remember her as young and hot and not the sagging old mess that she is now. As for her memorial song, it will be &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince and when it's played, she wants every man around the world to don a black armband for a month and they need to wander the city and mourn. This goes for mascots as well, all of them. As for my pick, I want &quot;Growing Sideways' by Noah Kahan because it feels fitting. With our playlist firmly cemented, we went to the Request Line to get some roadie addons. Aaron picked &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; by Queen because he wants to go out on a high note. Mike had a perfect pairing by Alice in Chains by using &quot;Man in the Box&quot; at his wake and &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; at the funeral. Karalee wants &quot;Stranglehold&quot; by Ted Nugent. Carrie's mom wanted &quot;Grenade&quot; by Bruno Mars played for her and it may have had something to do with animosity toward her husband. Nick is literally going out in style by using &quot;Going Out in Style&quot; by the Dropkick Murphys as he feels it's a celebration of life. Zack chose &quot;Where Eagles Fly&quot; by Sammy Hagar because it was his dad who passed away several years ago favorite song and it felt they would be together in the sky in the afterlife. Marty chose a sad yet positive song in &quot;Remember We Die&quot; by Gemini Syndrome. If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Moving away from death and onto money, which tends to be the leading cause of death sometimes (people stressing over it, not having enough, etc.) We didn't even need to reach delusional portions for this cash introduction as we started with a question. If Marris was to drop something in a urinal, would he fish it out? If it was a phone, definitely. Even with all the piss on it, he would throw it in rice and let it get soaked out while he lysoled everything. Angi's question had to do with a penny though, a singular penny. Marris said no way but if it was paper money then totally (sounds right to me.) A poll was conducted about a target practice penny and 62 men (13%) said they would take it. Marris was rightfully disgusted and wondered why anyone would consider it. Outside of it being like a penny collector or the penny being a special edition one that was worth $100, they belong in the trash. Dude's polled said they would take paper money even though that is gross which led to Marris revealing he will sometimes put paper money in his mouth!!! (BRB crying, screaming, throwing up) The point is that if you see free money, you take it if it is worthwhile even if Angi is against it. Since we have to always end off the rails, Angi wondered what men do in the bathroom. She saw fellow iHeart employee and \u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkiss.fm%2F&data=05%7C02%7CChristopherLeach%40iheartmedia.com%7C03d941e21d454991c04a08dc7a724448%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C638519878397083296%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=VTN%2BC3C80e7LAocjKZXw6OlTDxoMEgkuj1m3apypyYg%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">KISS.FM\u003c/a> guy Jason Brown go in with Marris and wondered if Jason Brown had taken a peek at Marris' meat monster. She's betting he has and Marris, well, Marris needs to consider this thought now.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, if you have trouble getting dressed in the morning, perhaps you should consider the Tiktok &quot;Sandwich Method.&quot; This means that you match the shoes to your shirt and the pants can be whatever as they are the meat. When Marris dresses, it's usually the hat first and then it trickles down. Sometimes he will match shirt to hat and not care from there. Angi does the shirt first and then matches the shoes to it. Basically, if it works, just go with it. On the flip, you can also match jeans to your hat and make the shirt the meat. See, Angi is a fashionista so everything must be perfect in her presence or you'll get the chop. You seek to create balance and not be too matchy matchy. Angi then gave the business to anyone who mixes labels like ADIDAS track pants and a Nike shirt. We came to hear that Marris does that sometimes and if she saw him with ADIDAS and Puma together, she would send the fashion police after him (I think those are the Queer Eye people.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Request Wars 3.5\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Theme: Rock and Metal Songs with a Billion Streams\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Current Champion: Angi (2x)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Angi's Song Choice: “Chop Suey&quot; System of a Down\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris' Song Choice: &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; by The White Stripes\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Winner: Angi\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>10 O' Clock Toast\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Toastee: Perry Farrell\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marris and Angi had a covid date (they don't have it, they just watched the same documentary at their own houses at the same time,) watching\u003cem> Lolla: The Story of Lollapalooza\u003c/em> on Paramount Plus last night.

To hear everything that happened, check out the podcast of today's show. However, if you're looking for a quick read along with random self inserts and my personal thoughts, you've come to the right place.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Call in Point\u003c/strong>:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>(This is the broadstroke canvas on which I base my call, obviously these notes are going to be longer and more detailed.)\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Now, before I go into the nonsense that was today's show, I should probably plaster a giant disclaimer here. We are basically idiots and taking advice from us is not the most smartest (points if you know where that phrase comes from) idea. However, in some rare moments, we find our way toward the light and offer up pieces of knowledge that are worth indulging in. This happened to be the case when Angi mined some nuggets from Instagram prophets who divulge outdated sayings as if it is some form of sound wisdom (it's not.) These common phrases are on the way out and in turn, we offered a fresh coat of paint for them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Don't Go to Bed Angry&quot; - Better idea, don't listen to this because it's dumb. In some situations, as Angi explained, you need a new perspective and a fresh brain to look at everything in a new light. Marris followed that conceding by walking away and sleeping it out is sometimes the right idea. Not every problem can/should be resolved before bed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Never Give Up&quot; - The reality is sometimes things are just not bound to work out and you need to let them go.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Ignore a Bully&quot; - Nope, sometimes the situation calls for a punch in the face and if they have it coming, don't feel afraid to swing and not miss.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Don't Be Afraid to Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow.&quot; - While this could be true, it also can be a source of trouble and is entirely circumstantial and should not dictate making better decisions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Tough It Out&quot; - This is not always true, some relationships need to end, some friendships need to dissolve. You should not be afraid to cut the cord.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Forgive and Forget&quot; - This is a mixed bag because there is partial correctness here. Depending on the situation, forgiveness should be given. However, like an elephant, you should never forget. Poor behaviors tend to pattern and should be watched out for and usually continue. Forgiving someone means you can keep them in your life but it doesn't mean to trust them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Treat People the Way You Want to Be Treated&quot; - Flip the script on this one, treat people the way they treat you.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;Trust Your Gut&quot; While this can be empowering, anxiety and issues can work against you and make your gut instinct wrong and in cases like Angi, make you indecisive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Here's one final one straight from new LARPer Angi's mouth that is correct: &quot;Booze Before Before, in the Clear. Beer Before Booze, You Lose.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Other Stuff from Today's Show\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Though the recurring theme today was cheating, it was also cheating that brought us (and by us I mean Angi and our own collective amusement,) into the wonderful (see: nerd, loser, dork) world of LARPing. After talking to roadie Paul, who dressed up like a male fairy (fairy is a non binary word,) to appease the woman he was cheating on his ex wife with. As you probably should have guessed/expected/known, Angi was completely enthralled with LARPing after that and she went about attempting to learn all she could about it. Now, this is a pulled together piece of ideas because I could discuss Angi watching LARPing porn with Marris but again, that was to be expected. Upon understanding what LARPing is and avoiding an aneurysm, Angi decided that she may want to LARP. Her first idea was Jake from State Farm but she switched it up to the more proper Ann Boleyn. Now, she was unsure if she had sword skills but she did ride her horse like a whore (with her thighs, none of that side saddle nonsense,) and so shoe/fits, etc. As I said above, Angi went on Pornhub during commercial and song breaks and also played us a snippet of an orgy on air (minus the fun sex) but I am proud to say the roadies did offer her costume ideas on the Request Line. She was told to do \u003cem>Game of Thrones\u003c/em>, Fembot, \u003cem>Vikings\u003c/em> character Lagertha the ShieldMaiden, The Devil and April O'Neil. That last was dismissed only because she would ruin the fantasy for Marris. We capped our LARP adventure (in this section, it continued to seep into the show,) which Angi learning that LARPing meetups may not have a lot of hot guys but if she drinks enough mead, she could get them up a notch. Unfortunately, she spent most of her life doing that so I don't think it will work.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Right, getting away from LARPing and jumping right back into the place where this whole LARPing mess started, we have a Daily Discussion Topic about cheating. Now, we all know the famous story of Angi's boyfriend who ate the napkin with another girl's phone number on it. While this isn't as silly as her story, a woman discovered her husband was cheating when she had to take her dog to the vet. The female vet discussed the surreal experience when she watched in real time what happened when she saved the dog's life because it had something tangled up in its intestines. It turns out that was a thong that the dog ate that belonged to the woman her husband was cheating with. Instead of doing it in person, the mess was done over the phone in the vet's office which probably made her showing her the expensive surgery bill even more awkward. The dog ended up being okay but the marriage pretty much died that day. Now, Marris does not have anything to contribute to this topic as he has never been cheated on (that he knows of) because as Angi put it &quot;he lays it down good and a girl wouldn't dream of giving that up.&quot; However, the roadies on the Request Line did have some wild ways of showcasing how they discovered cheating. We began with Paul, who would end up derailing the whole show, who told us that he cheated on his wife. She discovered it when she found his LARPing costume, a male fairy, because the girl he was seeing was into fairy erotica. He kept tights and a tunic in his truck and one day, she stumbled upon them. It technically had a happy ending I guess because he stayed with the fairy princess after he divorced his wife. Jeffery told a very long roundabout story so I'm going to trim it down some. Basically, he is a utility worker and has a company truck and his car. His girl at the time was a hairdresser. After a back and forth of him attempting to see her and get a trim, she said she had to take her mother to the emergency room. He went home, saw his car she was using there and after going in and calling around for her, found the man she had a child with prior coming down the stairs in his PJ's. Instead of punching, they figured out she was double dipping. Tom's ex wife said she was going to the tanning salon and explained coming home looking like a sweaty mess on it. A week later he found spray tan and realized she was going out banging. Pamela was six months pregnant and making a baby blanket when women's intuition willed her to the first floor of her house to literally see the guy she was with sticking his hands down the pants of another girl who was staying with them for some reason (it wasn't abundantly clear.) If you are looking for more roadie thoughts or have your own, hit up our Facebook group (Angi Taylor Show) and drop us a comment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Finally, Angi brought up the recently released Ashley Madison documentary and mentioned how not only is cheating rampant but there have been a list of hot spots released to showcase where it is most abundant. While Marris assumed Naperville would make the list, Angi pointed out they were famous for swingers. So, where are the actual places? Glad you asked, here's the top 20.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>1. Columbus, Ohio\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>2. Miami, Florida,\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>3. Orlando, Florida\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>4. Las Vegas, Nevada\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>5. Atlanta, Georgia\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6.
