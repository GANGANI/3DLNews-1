He has recently gone back to his \ncomedic roots on his No Hate No Fear comedy tour, sharing his newest \nmaterial with smaller, more intimate audiences. As a comedian who finds \nthe hilarious irony in both the day-to-day and the newsworthy events, \nCarlos is never lacking in material; he recently shot two stand-up \nspecials due out later this year.   Carlos will also reprise his role as\n Felix Boulevardez in Disney+'s \"The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,\" \nthe revival of the groundbreaking animated series \"The Proud Family.\"  \nThe show is heading into its second season. </p>\n<p>Mencia comes \nfrom a humble background, born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the 17th of \n18 children. His parents sent him to the United States when he was three\n months old, where he was raised in the Maravilla Projects in Los \nAngeles by his aunt and uncle. In his early teens, Mencia moved back to \nHonduras.  When Mencia returned to Los Angeles, he showed such \neducational prowess that he pursued a career in engineering.  But an \namateur night at the world-renowned Laugh Factory comedy club would \nchange his path, and a career in comedy began.  He became a regular at \nThe Comedy Store, performing nightly. After he found success on the Los \nAngeles comedy circuit, Mencia was named International Comedy Grand \nChampion from Buscando Estrellas (the Latin version of Star Search), \neventually landing on shows such as \"In Living Color,\" \"The Arsenio Hall\n Show,\" and \"An Evening at the Improv.\"  </p>\n<p>Mencia \ncontinued his journey up the comedy ladder by headlining stand-up tours \nand starring in stand-up TV specials. In 2002, he received a CableACE \nAward nomination for Best Stand-Up Comedy Special for his HBO special. \nComedy Central soon took notice and the show \"Mind of Mencia\" went into \ndevelopment. Created by Carlos and comedy producer Robert Morton, the \ncomedy series featured Carlos and his crew with their merciless mix of \nup-close stand-up, unconventional street interviews, and shocking \ncommercial parodies.  The show was an instant hit, and propelled Mencia \nto the comedy elite.  After the first season, Comedy Central signed \nMencia back for an original stand-up special, \"Carlos Mencia: No Strings\n Attached,\" the first Comedy Central Stand-up Special DVD to achieve \nPlatinum sales status. </p>\n<p>Throughout the four seasons of \n“Mind of Mencia,” Carlos never stopped performing live, headlining shows\n across the country and internationally.  “Comedy is my art, and fans \nare my passion,” he has said.   Always looking to give back to those \nfans, Mencia has entertained troops serving overseas for USO tours in \nTurkey, Kirkuk, Baghdad, Qatar, Afghanistan, and many other countries.  </p>\n<p>Later,\n Mencia went on to star on the big screen.  He starred opposite Ben \nStiller and Michelle Monaghan in \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" and in the \nfamily-comedy \"Our Family Wedding,\" alongside America Ferrara and \nForrest Whitaker.  </p>\n<p>Carlos Mencia presently lives in Los \nAngeles with his wife and two sons.

He has recently gone back to his \ncomedic roots on his No Hate No Fear comedy tour, sharing his newest \nmaterial with smaller, more intimate audiences. As a comedian who finds \nthe hilarious irony in both the day-to-day and the newsworthy events, \nCarlos is never lacking in material; he recently shot two stand-up \nspecials due out later this year.   Carlos will also reprise his role as\n Felix Boulevardez in Disney+'s \"The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,\" \nthe revival of the groundbreaking animated series \"The Proud Family.\"  \nThe show is heading into its second season. </p>\n<p>Mencia comes \nfrom a humble background, born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the 17th of \n18 children. His parents sent him to the United States when he was three\n months old, where he was raised in the Maravilla Projects in Los \nAngeles by his aunt and uncle. In his early teens, Mencia moved back to \nHonduras.  When Mencia returned to Los Angeles, he showed such \neducational prowess that he pursued a career in engineering.  But an \namateur night at the world-renowned Laugh Factory comedy club would \nchange his path, and a career in comedy began.  He became a regular at \nThe Comedy Store, performing nightly. After he found success on the Los \nAngeles comedy circuit, Mencia was named International Comedy Grand \nChampion from Buscando Estrellas (the Latin version of Star Search), \neventually landing on shows such as \"In Living Color,\" \"The Arsenio Hall\n Show,\" and \"An Evening at the Improv.\"  </p>\n<p>Mencia \ncontinued his journey up the comedy ladder by headlining stand-up tours \nand starring in stand-up TV specials. In 2002, he received a CableACE \nAward nomination for Best Stand-Up Comedy Special for his HBO special. \nComedy Central soon took notice and the show \"Mind of Mencia\" went into \ndevelopment. Created by Carlos and comedy producer Robert Morton, the \ncomedy series featured Carlos and his crew with their merciless mix of \nup-close stand-up, unconventional street interviews, and shocking \ncommercial parodies.  The show was an instant hit, and propelled Mencia \nto the comedy elite.  After the first season, Comedy Central signed \nMencia back for an original stand-up special, \"Carlos Mencia: No Strings\n Attached,\" the first Comedy Central Stand-up Special DVD to achieve \nPlatinum sales status. </p>\n<p>Throughout the four seasons of \n“Mind of Mencia,” Carlos never stopped performing live, headlining shows\n across the country and internationally.  “Comedy is my art, and fans \nare my passion,” he has said.   Always looking to give back to those \nfans, Mencia has entertained troops serving overseas for USO tours in \nTurkey, Kirkuk, Baghdad, Qatar, Afghanistan, and many other countries.  </p>\n<p>Later,\n Mencia went on to star on the big screen.  He starred opposite Ben \nStiller and Michelle Monaghan in \"The Heartbreak Kid,\" and in the \nfamily-comedy \"Our Family Wedding,\" alongside America Ferrara and \nForrest Whitaker.  </p>\n<p>Carlos Mencia presently lives in Los \nAngeles with his wife and two sons.

But he is not just a comedian he is also the cohost of the weekly hockey podcast, \"Enjoying Orange Slices with Jeff and Ian.” </p>\n<p>Early in his life, he discovered a love for hockey. Whether he was involved in minor, junior, pro, or friends getting together to play shinny, he loved hockey! He went to some camps and was cut, realizing he had no chance of making the pros. He knew it was time to use his natural talent to make people laugh. </p>\n<p>Life has been fantastic for this energetic and wildly funny boundary-pushing entertainer. Touring nonstop across North America, he has started taking over the world with Australia, China, and the Middle East. With Europe being one of his latest stops. His fast-paced, off-the- cuff, quick-witted, animated style has him winning over television audiences. He placed in the finals of NBC's \"Last Comic Standing.\" He made appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and \"The Tonight Show,\" A popular guest on WTF, YMH,a half-hour comedy featured on Comedy Central and HBO, not to mention one-hour specials on Showtime \"Getting to know you\" and Amazon Prime \"Conversations\"! It also has earned him roles in award-winning movies like MVP 2! (humble brag) </p>\n<p>His fast-paced multi-direction show has made patrons want to see multiple shows on a weekend. The audience becomes characters in his performance as they answer questions. Most\\ comedians have a monologue; Ian has a dialogue.
