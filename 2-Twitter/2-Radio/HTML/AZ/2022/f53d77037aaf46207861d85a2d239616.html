He filmed a new one-hour special in his home town of St. Louis, “Can A Brother Get Some Love?,” and is on DVD from Entertainment One. In addition, he filmed an episode of “Workaholics” for Comedy Central and he’s been casted in a recurring role on the AMC’s Emmy Award-winning “Breaking Bad.” If that’s not enough, he was also seen as a regular panelist on E! Entertainment’s “Chelsea Lately” and a regular on “Lopez Tonight,” performing in various comedy sketches on the show. From his numerous television appearances and as one of the hottest touring acts in the country, audiences are becoming increasingly familiar with Lavell’s giant-sized talent. Lavell gained huge national exposure on NBC’s hit reality series “Last Comic Standing.” Not only did NBC take notice, promptly signing Lavell to a holding deal with the network, but also Comedy Central, offering him his own half-hour standup special, “Comedy Central Presents: Lavell Crawford.\" Lavell’s stand-out work includes appearances on \"Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam\" which premiered on Showtime in December, “Russell Simmons’ Def Comedy Jam” on HBO, “Showtime at the Apollo,” “Martin Lawrence Presents 1st Amendment,” “Comic’s Unleashed with Byron Allen,” “Steve Harvey’s Big Time” “Comedy Central’s Premium Blend,” “Motown Live” and “BET’s Comic View.” In addition, Lavell has appeared in the films “Baby’s Mama Drama,” “Beverlyhood,” “Ghetto South Problems,” and on the televised series “The Jamie Foxx Show.” On stage, he played Ben in the hit play “Men Cry in the Dark,” based on the Michael Baisden best seller. Lavell also recently appeared on stage with the critically acclaimed production “Friends and Lovers,” a stage production based on the novel by author Eric Jerome Dickey where he played the scene-stealing Bobby. The play also featured notable actors such as Miguel Nunez (“Juwana Man”), Leon (“The Five Heartbeats”), Monica Calhoun (“The Best Man”), Mel Jackson (“Soul Food”) and Maia Campbell (“In the House”). Endeared by audiences far and wide, Lavell has built a very strong fan base playing theatres, comedy clubs and colleges across the nation in addition to festivals including HBO's US Comedy Arts Festival, The Comedy Festival and LAFFAPALOOZA, America's longest-running annual urban comedy festival.      \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Earliest Show On Friday And All Saturday Shows Are 21+ | All Other Shows 18+ Unless Otherwise Stated\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE DON'T PURCHASE TICKETS FROM ANY OTHER SITE.   \u003cstrong\u003eTICKET RESALE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOUR NAME, CREDIT CARD, ADDRESS, AND EMAIL ADDRESS WILL BE VERIFIED.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tTICKETS SUSPECTED OF BEING PURCHASED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RESELLING \nWILL BE CANCELLED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE DANIA IMPROV. \n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE SEATING IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND WE WON’T BE ABLE TO SEAT INCOMPLETE PARTIES \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEED A RESERVED TABLE FOR YOUR ENTIRE PARTY? \u003c/strong\u003eCall The Box Office And Ask How You Can Fly First Class And Upgrade To Reserved Seating!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSPECIAL OCCASION?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tGroups Of 20+ Are Eligible For Exclusive Food \u0026amp; Beverage Packages \nThat Also Include Guaranteed Reserved Seating!

He filmed a new one-hour special in his home town of St. Louis, “Can A Brother Get Some Love?,” and is on DVD from Entertainment One. In addition, he filmed an episode of “Workaholics” for Comedy Central and he’s been casted in a recurring role on the AMC’s Emmy Award-winning “Breaking Bad.” If that’s not enough, he was also seen as a regular panelist on E! Entertainment’s “Chelsea Lately” and a regular on “Lopez Tonight,” performing in various comedy sketches on the show. From his numerous television appearances and as one of the hottest touring acts in the country, audiences are becoming increasingly familiar with Lavell’s giant-sized talent. Lavell gained huge national exposure on NBC’s hit reality series “Last Comic Standing.” Not only did NBC take notice, promptly signing Lavell to a holding deal with the network, but also Comedy Central, offering him his own half-hour standup special, “Comedy Central Presents: Lavell Crawford.\" Lavell’s stand-out work includes appearances on \"Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam\" which premiered on Showtime in December, “Russell Simmons’ Def Comedy Jam” on HBO, “Showtime at the Apollo,” “Martin Lawrence Presents 1st Amendment,” “Comic’s Unleashed with Byron Allen,” “Steve Harvey’s Big Time” “Comedy Central’s Premium Blend,” “Motown Live” and “BET’s Comic View.” In addition, Lavell has appeared in the films “Baby’s Mama Drama,” “Beverlyhood,” “Ghetto South Problems,” and on the televised series “The Jamie Foxx Show.” On stage, he played Ben in the hit play “Men Cry in the Dark,” based on the Michael Baisden best seller. Lavell also recently appeared on stage with the critically acclaimed production “Friends and Lovers,” a stage production based on the novel by author Eric Jerome Dickey where he played the scene-stealing Bobby. The play also featured notable actors such as Miguel Nunez (“Juwana Man”), Leon (“The Five Heartbeats”), Monica Calhoun (“The Best Man”), Mel Jackson (“Soul Food”) and Maia Campbell (“In the House”). Endeared by audiences far and wide, Lavell has built a very strong fan base playing theatres, comedy clubs and colleges across the nation in addition to festivals including HBO's US Comedy Arts Festival, The Comedy Festival and LAFFAPALOOZA, America's longest-running annual urban comedy festival.      \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Earliest Show On Friday And All Saturday Shows Are 21+ | All Other Shows 18+ Unless Otherwise Stated\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE DON'T PURCHASE TICKETS FROM ANY OTHER SITE.   \u003cstrong\u003eTICKET RESALE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOUR NAME, CREDIT CARD, ADDRESS, AND EMAIL ADDRESS WILL BE VERIFIED.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tTICKETS SUSPECTED OF BEING PURCHASED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RESELLING \nWILL BE CANCELLED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE DANIA IMPROV. \n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE SEATING IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE AND WE WON’T BE ABLE TO SEAT INCOMPLETE PARTIES \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNEED A RESERVED TABLE FOR YOUR ENTIRE PARTY? \u003c/strong\u003eCall The Box Office And Ask How You Can Fly First Class And Upgrade To Reserved Seating!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSPECIAL OCCASION?\u003c/strong\u003e\n\tGroups Of 20+ Are Eligible For Exclusive Food \u0026amp; Beverage Packages \nThat Also Include Guaranteed Reserved Seating!
