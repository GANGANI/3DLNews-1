<p>“THE LIVES OF BRIAN”: If fate had a plan for Brian Johnson, fate didn’t stand a chance. </p>
<p>After spending over a decade trying to make his mark with a succession of bands and then taking a job where he ran his own business, Brian was invited to London out of the blue for an audition with one of the world’s best up and coming acts. AC/DC was a band in crisis following the tragic death of their lead singer, Bon Scott, but with Brian on board they would record their masterpiece: “Back in Black”. It became the biggest-selling rock album of all time. </p>
<p>The tour that followed played to packed-out arenas and Brian was embraced by their fans. But there was to be a twist in the tale. In 2016, Brian was forced to quit the band after being diagnosed with hearing loss, only to make a triumphant return to the band he loved with the release of 2020ʼs smash hit album “Power Up”. Brian has lived many lives within his lifetime, but somehow he has kept his feet on the ground, never losing touch with his roots. </p>
<p>Touching, personal, indomitable, but always laugh-out-loud funny, “The Lives of Brian” is the story of one of the world’s best-loved performers, told in his own inimitable and unique voice. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>BRIAN JOHNSON &amp; AC/DC: </p>
<p>*After the death of Bon Scott, Johnson became the third lead singer of AC/DC in 1980. </p>
<p>*Johnson’s first album with AC/DC, “Back in Black”, became the biggest-selling rock album of all time. *Johnson &amp; AC/DC got inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. </p>
<p>*Johnson temporarily stepped away from AC/DC in 2016 due to hearing problems. </p>
<p>*AC/DC officially confirmed in 2020 that Johnson, along with fellow band-mates Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams, had returned in August 2018 to record the band's 2020 album, “Power Up”. </p>
<p>*Johnson fronted the local band Geordie before joining AC/DC. *Johnson’s first book, “Rockers and Rollers”, was published in 2009.</p></div></div></div></span></div><div class="sc-dbOWvR gEtaWs"><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy lmzmbZ" data-encore-id="type">Dec 15, 2022</span><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy lmzmbZ" data-encore-id="type">08:12</span></div></a><a href="/chris-chaos3/episodes/EDGAR-WINTER-ON-AIR-MIX--Rock-Legend-Releases-New-Tribute-Album-to-Late-Brother-Johnny--Featuring-Taylor-Hawkins--Joe-Walsh--Ringo-Starr--Billy-Gibbons--Michael-McDonald---More-e1qi9ja" class="sc-idzFOD feGpYq"><div class="sc-fUCpks kqDpoF"><img src="https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_episode400/26718750/26718750-1668099724241-3900dcbdeb2ec.jpg" alt="EDGAR WINTER ON AIR MIX- Rock Legend Releases New Tribute Album to Late Brother Johnny, Featuring Taylor Hawkins, Joe Walsh, Ringo Starr, Billy Gibbons, Michael McDonald, &amp; More" class="sc-bRRyTH dxdhcD"/><div class="sc-kmNQGK cIEpNc"><button aria-label="Play icon" data-encore-id="buttonPrimary" data-is-icon-only="true" class="Button-sc-qlcn5g-0 htUqWl"><span class="ButtonInner-sc-14ud5tc-0 kUzWrn encore-base-set"><span aria-hidden="true" class="IconWrapper__Wrapper-sc-1hf1hjl-0 eTQuMm"><svg data-encore-id="icon" role="img" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="Svg-sc-ytk21e-0 dbYkfl"><path d='M3 1.713a.7.7 0 0 1 1.05-.607l10.89 6.288a.7.7 0 0 1 0 1.212L4.05 14.894A.7.7 0 0 1 3 14.288V1.713z'/></svg></span></span><span class="ButtonFocus-sc-2hq6ey-0 jNccKH"></span></button></div></div><div class="sc-fZhijA kHkfVU"><h4 data-cy="episodeFeedTitle" data-encore-id="type" class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 kdYRfT"><div line="2" class="sc-jqELIZ eGLNnr">EDGAR WINTER ON AIR MIX- Rock Legend Releases New Tribute Album to Late Brother Johnny, Featuring Taylor Hawkins, Joe Walsh, Ringo Starr, Billy Gibbons, Michael McDonald, &amp; More</div></h4><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy sc-dcTLCP lmzmbZ bNgLKn" data-encore-id="type"><div class="sc-jHrLvE jBUyjr"><div numMaxLines="2" class="sc-kDxOyZ DWMPR"><div><p>PROMOTING: NEW ALBUM “BROTHER JOHNNY”, AVAILABLE NOW AT ITUNES, AMAZON, &amp; WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR MUSIC “BROTHER JOHNNY” – </p>

<p><strong>Nothing More </strong>is an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rock</a> band from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">San Antonio, Texas</a>. Formed in 2003, the band spent much of the 2000s recording independent albums and struggling to maintain a steady lineup or attract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record label</a> interest. Towards the end of the decade, the band's long-time drummer, Jonny Hawkins, decided to switch to being the band's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontman" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frontman</a> and lead vocalist, stabilizing the band's core lineup along with other long-time members Mark Vollelunga (guitar) and Daniel Oliver (bass). </p>
<p>The band self-funded and recorded their fourth studio album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_More_(album)" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Nothing More</em></a>, over the course of three years and used it to gain the attention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_Seven_Music" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eleven Seven Music</a> record label, who signed the band to a five album record contract upon hearing it. The album became the band's breakthrough release in 2014, with multiple charting singles, including "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_is_the_Time_(Ballast)" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This is the Time (Ballast)</a>", which hit number 1 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediabase" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mediabase</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Rock" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Active Rock</a> chart and number 2 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Billboard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_Rock_(chart)" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mainstream Rock</a> chart, and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._MTV" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mr. MTV</a>", "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_(Nothing_More_song)" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jenny</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here%27s_to_the_Heartache" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here's to the Heartache</a>" all charting in the top 15 of both charts.</p>

<p>PROMOTING: NEW MEMOIR “LIVING ON A THIN LINE”, AVAILABLE NOW ON KINDLE AND AUDIBLE AT AMAZON.COM. HARDCOVER AVAILABLE IN JANUARY, 2023 </p>
<p>PROMOTING: SINGLE “21ST CENTURY” WRITTEN WITH GERRY GOFFIN, AVAILABLE ON VINYL ON RECORD STORE DAY, NOVEMBER 25TH “MUSWELL HILLBILLIES/EVERYBODY’S IN SHOWBIZ”: This 50th anniversary boxed set from The Kinks includes the band’s pivotal 70s releases – Muswell Hillbillies, Everybody’s In Show-Biz and the single, 1975’s Everybody’s A Star. </p>
<p>The beginning of the 70s marked a shift in the Kinks’ career. Having signed to RCA Records in 1971, the British band started a new era and gradually formed a new identity. With their growing American fanbase, the Kinks revised the phenomenon of Englishness and looked back on their London roots. This revision started with the 1971’s album Muswell Hillbillies which combines tales about working-class families from North London and whimsical country sound, associated with American music. Following this trajectory, Celluloid Heroes, the final track from Everybody’s In Show-Biz, reflects on Hollywood as a factory, mass-producing the bittersweet American dream. </p>
<p>The anniversary edition contains a previously unseen, digitally restored 1971’s home movie, narrated by Ray Davies. The songs are remastered from newly discovered Davies’s original master tapes. “LIVING ON A THIN LINE”: In his autobiography, Dave Davies revisits the glory days of the band that spawned so much extraordinary music, and which had such a profound influence on bands from The Clash and Van Halen to Oasis and Blur. </p>
<p>Full of tales of the tumultuous times and the ups-and-downs of his relationship with his brother Ray, along with encounters with the likes of John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix, this will be a glorious read for Kinks fans and anyone who wants to read about the heyday of rock 'n' roll. “21ST CENTURY”: This never-before-heard song was written by Dave Davies and Gerry Goffin on napkins in 1992 while the two were together at a coffee shop in LA. </p>
<p>The song was originally written about the then-upcoming new millennium; however, lyrically the song could have been written today. The B-side "Web of Time" comes from the 2018 album “Decade”. </p>
<p>DAVE DAVIES &amp; THE KINKS: *Co-founder, lead guitarist, &amp; backing vocalist for The Kinks, fronted by his brother, Ray Davies. </p>
<p>*The Kinks were regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s &amp; part of the first British Invasion. </p>
<p>*The Kinks have sold over fifty million records. </p>
<p>*The Kinks’ songs include “You Really Got Me”, “All Day and All of the Night”, “Tired of Waiting for You”, “Lola”, “A Rock ‘n Roll Fantasy”, “Come Dancing”, &amp; “Don’t Forget to Dance”. </p>
<p>*Davies got inducted into the Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of The Kinks. </p>

Joe Kenda is a 23-year veteran of the Colorado Springs Police Department. He spent 21 years chasing killers as a  homicide detective and commander of the major crimes unit.</p>
<p>• Joe and his team solved 356 of his 387 homicide cases, getting a 92% solve rate - one of the highest in the country.</p>
<p>• After retiring from law enforcement, Joe starred in <strong>“Homicide Hunter: Lt. Joe Kenda,”</strong> an American true-crime  documentary series that ran for <strong>NINE</strong><strong> seasons</strong>on Investigation Discovery (ID). It is now available on Discovery+.</p>
<p>• Joe is promoting the <strong>FIRST OF THREE</strong> theatrical length "Homicide Hunters" <strong>SPECIALS</strong> which he stars in. <strong> "Homicide  Hunter: Never Give Up"</strong> premieres on  <strong>INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY</strong>  -  <strong>WEDS., AUGUST 17th</strong>  at 9p Et/Pt.</p>
<p>• The “Homicide Hunter: Never Give Up” special will also be available to stream on Discovery+ beginning that same day.</p>
<p>• The special follows on the heels of the conclusion of the latest season of <strong>"American Detective w/Lt. Joe Kenda” </strong>which  concluded last Wednesday (8/10) on Investigation Discovery and is also available on Discovery+.</p>
<p>• During <strong>"Homicide Hunter’s"</strong> <strong>NINE Seasons</strong>  on  <strong>Investigation Discovery</strong>, Joe captivated viewers with stories from the  hundreds of murder cases he solved throughout his 23-year-long career.</p>
<p>• With an eidetic memory and a 92% closure rate, Joe recounted all the success stories he had to tell on the hit TV series….  until now.  Three cases that kept Lt. Joe Kenda up at night will finally be put to rest as he returns to the screen for  three theatrical-length “HOMICIDE HUNTER” specials, revealing chilling new details of career-defining cases.</p>
<p>• With his gruff voice and no-nonsense demeanor Joe leads viewers through labyrinthine cases that have plagued him for years</p>
<p>• In the first <strong>"HOMICIDE HUNTER: NEVER GIVE UP" </strong>special, the body of a 20-year-old active-duty soldier, Darlene  Krashoc, is found dumped behind a restaurant in Colorado in March 1987.  A victim of torture and sexual assault, Joe  and his team recall the series of events that occurred throughout the investigation and the many leads which turned  into dead ends. But before the case goes cold, Kenda has the foresight to meticulously package and preserve every  piece of fluid evidence found at the crime scene, a costly and complicated endeavor at the time, noting, “it may never  come to anything, but it could come to everything.” More than three decades later with new DNA technology, what it  came to is definitively putting a name to Darlene’s killer: Michael David Whyte.</p>
<p>• This feature-length special, allows viewers follow along as Joe and his team painstakingly recount the investigation from  1987 and the 2,000 pages of case files that never pointed them toward Whyte. Now, with DNA evidence collected at  the scene more than three decades ago and with help from the cold case team at the Colorado Springs Police  Department, the shadow in the night has a name, Darlene’s parents have justice,  and Kenda has one less nightmare.</p>
<p>• Details on the remaining two "HOMICIDE HUNTER" SPECIALS will be released at a later date.</p>
<p>• Joe has written two books, "I Will Find You" and "Killer Triggers”.</p>

<p>“Icons Unearthed: Star Wars” is like no other “Star Wars” documentary you've ever seen before, with unprecedented access to the key players in the creation of the franchise. </p>
<p>Director Brian VolkWeiss and his team spent months filming and interviewing filmmakers, actors and crew members across the world, from England to Tunisia, to source exclusive, previously unknown, and surprising stories.</p></div></div></div></span></div><div class="sc-dbOWvR gEtaWs"><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy lmzmbZ" data-encore-id="type">Aug 04, 2022</span><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy lmzmbZ" data-encore-id="type">06:47</span></div></a><a href="/chris-chaos3/episodes/Brittany-Campbell---Woman-Featured-in-Premiere-Episode-of-Series-Examining-People-Secretly-Living-Inside-Someone-Elses-Home-e1lcqke" class="sc-idzFOD feGpYq"><div class="sc-fUCpks kqDpoF"><img src="https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_episode400/26718750/26718750-1658174481186-243c029da244b.jpg" alt="Brittany Campbell - Woman Featured in Premiere Episode of Series Examining People Secretly Living Inside Someone Else’s Home" class="sc-bRRyTH dxdhcD"/><div class="sc-kmNQGK cIEpNc"><button aria-label="Play icon" data-encore-id="buttonPrimary" data-is-icon-only="true" class="Button-sc-qlcn5g-0 htUqWl"><span class="ButtonInner-sc-14ud5tc-0 kUzWrn encore-base-set"><span aria-hidden="true" class="IconWrapper__Wrapper-sc-1hf1hjl-0 eTQuMm"><svg data-encore-id="icon" role="img" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="Svg-sc-ytk21e-0 dbYkfl"><path d='M3 1.713a.7.7 0 0 1 1.05-.607l10.89 6.288a.7.7 0 0 1 0 1.212L4.05 14.894A.7.7 0 0 1 3 14.288V1.713z'/></svg></span></span><span class="ButtonFocus-sc-2hq6ey-0 jNccKH"></span></button></div></div><div class="sc-fZhijA kHkfVU"><h4 data-cy="episodeFeedTitle" data-encore-id="type" class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 kdYRfT"><div line="2" class="sc-jqELIZ eGLNnr">Brittany Campbell - Woman Featured in Premiere Episode of Series Examining People Secretly Living Inside Someone Else’s Home</div></h4><span class="Type__TypeElement-sc-goli3j-0 dLoEEA sc-galXqy sc-dcTLCP lmzmbZ bNgLKn" data-encore-id="type"><div class="sc-jHrLvE jBUyjr"><div numMaxLines="2" class="sc-kDxOyZ DWMPR"><div><p>*Brittany Campbell is featured in the premiere episode.
