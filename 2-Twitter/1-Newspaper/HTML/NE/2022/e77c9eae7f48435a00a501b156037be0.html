I was a nightmare.'</p><p>"I was drinking and smoking at eight, and I once nearly burned the house down.</p><p>"I was trying to prove to my brother that Father Christmas wasn't real, so I found the costume and set fire to the beard.</p><p>"I dropped it on the sofa and the sofa caught fire. The whole room went up.</p><p>"Luckily, my older brother smelled the smoke and found us. Then the fire brigade came."</p><p>Talking about his arrest, Simon, who shares Eric with fiancée Lauren Silverman, 45, added: "I stole my dad's car at ten and crashed it. Then when I was 12, I hijacked a bus with a pea gun.</p><p>"I thought it wouldn't be taken seriously, but the driver called the police and I was arrested. I remember going back home and my mum being furious.</p><p>"She was the disciplinarian, my dad was always the softer one.</p><p>"He said so many things that stuck with me, but I can't remember him ever raising his voice to me.</p><p>"But I was so bad, slightly living on the edge. I was smart, but I wasn't academic at all. I could have never been a doctor and I had a very low boredom threshold.</p><p>"So it was school after school, and then I was out at 16."</p><p>Despite his antics, Simon also said he was "unbelievably shy" as a youngster.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_2" class="gallery-item-1615b7d7-39dd-5783-9025-bb9f7e7ec3d2" data-item="2"></a>

Peligro (Darren Henley) passed away in his Los Angeles home yesterday, Oct 28th.</p><p>"He died from trauma to his head from an accidental fall. Arrangements are pending will be announced in the coming days.</p><p>"Thank you for your thoughts and words of comfort."</p><p>Darren replaced the original drummer of The Dead Kennedys in 1981 and stayed with the group until their break up in 1986, before taking over from drummer Jack Irons in the Red Hot Chilli Peppers two years later.</p><p>He wrote songs on the group's fourth album 'Mother's Milk', though did not perform on it and was fired from the band in November 1988 and was replaced by its current drummer Chad Smith.</p><p>Darren also performed with bands such as The Hellations, Jungle Studs, Nailbomb, The Feederz, Lock-Up, The Two Free Stooges, Reverend Jones and SSI and fronted his own band Peligro, with whom he released three albums.</p><p>Red Hot Chilli Peppers bassist Flea said on Instagram alongside a black and white picture of Darren: "My dear friend, my brother I miss you so much. I'm devastated today, a river of tears, but all my life I will treasure every second.</p><p>"The first time I saw you play with the DK's in '81 you blew my mind. The power, the soul, the recklessness.</p><p>"You became my beloved friend, so many times of every kind. We had so much fun, so much joy, having each other's backs.</p><p>"I love you with all my heart. You are the truest rocker, and a crucial part of rhcp history.</p><p>"DHP in the place to be, you live forever in our hearts, you wild man, you bringer of joy, you giant hearted man.

                    <div class="article-content"><p>James Corden has stopped Googling himself.</p><p>The Late Late Show host, 44, admitted he can no longer tolerate seeing the abuse he receives online, and says it does not match up with the friendliness he experiences from fans on the street.</p><p>He told The Times newspaper on Saturday (29.10.22): "I've just stopped reading it (Internet comments about him.) I just won't do it.</p><p>"I don't Google myself, I don't read anything about myself. I can remember when Keira Knightley was talking about the things that people used to write about her, and then she just realised, 'Oh. I don't have to read this. It's nothing to do with me. I'll just concentrate on the work'."</p><p>"It's weird, because I walk around London, New York, LA, and people are lovely, you know? It's a f****** kick… people are so nice about what I do.</p><p>"I was cycling around (London), and I was cycling through this filter of just hearing my name, over and over - people shouting out, thumbs up. Genuinely and honestly, I mainly only ever get positive stuff."</p><p>James has been hit with trolls after he was called a "tiny cretin of a man" by restaurateur Keith McNally, 71, who barred him for life from his Balthazar eaterie for allegedly being rude to staff over a mix-up with an egg-yolk omelette.</p><p>James' Balthazar ban was then lifted after Keith said he called him to apologise.</p><p>The actor also insisted to The Times he complained at Balthazar as his wife Julia Carey, 46, with whom he shares three children, suffers from a "serious" egg white allergy.</p><p>He added: "I have never talked about eggs this much... people keep telling me, 'This is the world we live in!' And I don't know if that's right. I think it's a world we're actively creating, engaging in and encouraging. It's scary. Really scary."</p><p>"And you know, the reason I had to send the omelette back is because Jules is allergic to egg white. That's why we'd ordered an egg-yolk omelette. Her actual words were, 'But don't worry if you can't manage it.'"</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_4" class="gallery-item-1615b7d7-39dd-5783-9025-bb9f7e7ec3d2" data-item="4"></a>

So, what I chose to do was just go and do the best that I could… it sounded like my voice was off."</p><p>The chat with Diane, 76, was part of his ongoing promotion of his upcoming memoir 'Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing', in which he details his decades battling drug and drink addictions.</p><p>He said about wanting to use his experience to help others due to his celebrity status: "For some reason, it's obviously because I was on 'Friends', more people will listen to me, so I've got to take advantage of that - I've got to help as many people as I can."</p><p>Matthew also admitted to Diane the "weirdest" thing he did to feed his addictions was going to open houses so he could steal pills from medicine cabinets.</p><p>He said: "On Sundays, I would go to open houses and go to the bathrooms in the open house and see what pills they had in there and steal them. And I think they thought, 'Well, there's no way that Chandler came in and stole from us.'"</p><p>Matthew has said he was on 55 pain killers a day and dropped down to only 128lbs in weight in the depths of his pills addiction.</p><p>He also tells in his autobiography he woke up "50 to 60" times covered in his faeces while using a colostomy bag fitted after surgery to treat his exploded colon, which burst due to his drug and drink use.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div id="gallery_item_ad_4" class="item-ad text-center" style="min-height: 311px"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_5" class="gallery-item-1615b7d7-39dd-5783-9025-bb9f7e7ec3d2" data-item="5"></a>

It was strange seeing the clips. I got quite emotional."</p><p>He went on to explain he sees each of his movies as representing a period of time in his life so it feels strange to watch them again.</p><p>Tim added: "It feels like each film you do is part of your life and is very deep and meaningful so it's like watching your life flashing before your eyes - that's why I likened it to a funeral in a way, in a beautiful way, it captures moments of your life."</p><p>It comes after the moviemaker sidestepped rumours suggesting he might be in line to direct a sequel to 1988's 'Beetlejuice'. When asked whether he would be involved in a new movie, he told the website: "Nothing is out of the question".</p><p>He added: "I only know if I'm making a film when I'm actually on the set shooting.

Just in any normal family, it's sort of a hard thing to tell your dad--when you're a girl--that you're pregnant, and I'm sure people understand it can be a little bit awkward.

                    <div class="article-content"><p>Adele admits it's unlikely she'll achieve EGOT status because she's not keen on Broadway.</p><p>The 34-year-old singer is just a Tony award away from the full set (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) after she added an Emmy to her Grammys and Oscar in September.</p><p>Adele took home the Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) gong for her CBS special 'Adele One Night Only' at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards.</p><p>And while she admits she's happy to settle with an EGO as Broadway has never interested her and she's too "lazy" to do two shows a day, there is one role she wouldn't mind taking on, Rose from 'Gypsy'.</p><p>She told fans at an event to launch her new music video for 'I Drink Wine': "I saw [Gypsy] in London and I did love the role of the mum in it. She has a song [Rose's Turn] when she was like, 'I wanted to do all of this' and she's jealous of her own daughter and she's really caught up about it. At one bit, she was just a b**** in it which I could nail."</p><p>The 'Hello' hitmaker joked she could move her delayed Las Vegas residency to Broadway and cheat.</p><p>She continued: "I don't think I've seen enough [Broadway] as a grownup to know if I would want to do it. I was wondering, do I just move the show from Vegas to Broadway and win the Tony? I actually prefer the sound of an EGO than an EGOT. EGO is fun. But never say never. If I move to New York, I get bored, I'll be on that stage in a hot second."</p><p>Name-dropping musical legend Bette Midler, she added: "I actually know Bette Midler which is a big flex, right? Because she's one of my idols. She was like, 'You would never be able to keep up with the schedule on Broadway.' Because I'm so lazy. I'm so notoriously lazy … I would not be able to do matinees and all that. I don't have the stamina for that."</p><p>Adele quipped that she "officially has an EGO" after being honoured with her Emmy.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div id="gallery_item_ad_16" class="item-ad text-center" style="min-height: 311px"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_17" class="gallery-item-1615b7d7-39dd-5783-9025-bb9f7e7ec3d2" data-item="17"></a>

Like, 'Is that moment we've recreated alright?'</p><p>"But, you know, when I'm walking down the table, letting loose with a machine gun, it definitely gives you a lot of licence to go 'we're just we're doing something crazy and different'.</p><p>"If somebody played me as a crazy person, I'd be delighted."</p><p>Daniel recalls there being a "very celebratory" vibe on set. The actor also loved the speed of the shoot, describing it as an "amazing" experience.</p><p>He explained: "It was the fastest shoot I've ever done. It was amazing - it was so well-prepared, that you did feel like you were basically getting enough time for everything and everyone came in super prepared.</p><p>"Everyone came in also and realized very quickly, 'oh, we're getting like two, maybe three takes of everything. And that's just that's what it is, and you can't be too precious about it'.</p><p>"The vibe on set was just ... it did feel very celebratory all the time.

But that was then. Now, it's just art."</p><p>Lauren also insisted that the song's message still rings true.</p><p>The brunette beauty explained: "The songs that I write capture a moment when I'm in it.</p><p>"But for me, if the song can transcend the moment and still communicate to me and other people three years of it was written, and after I'm completely healed and not in that space anymore, I think that's a testament to it needing to go out into the world."</p><p>Lauren enjoyed huge success during her time in Fifth Harmony.</p><p>And Lauren is convinced that she now has the right team around her to achieve solo success.</p><p>She said: "At the end of the day, there's a lot of people creating music right now.

The moment I wrote my first song - I had no idea that I could do that. It just happened - it unlocked something inside me."</p><p>The 51-year-old singer went on to joke how her difficulties with spelling influence her 2004 hit single 'Hollaback Girl', laughing: "[I} went on to teach the whole world how to spell 'bananas'."</p><p>Gwen previously opened up about her dyslexia in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music for his 'At Home With' series, admitting she wasn't aware of her condition until her sons Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, six, from her marriage to ex-husband Gavin Rossdale began to have trouble reading.</p><p>She explained: "One thing that I've discovered through having kids is that I have dyslexia - everyone has things that happen and mine was that. And I feel like a lot of the problems that I have had or even decisions that I've made for myself stem from that, because now the children - obviously, it's all genetic - they have some of those issues."</p><p>However, Gwen insisted her boys are getting the right support with their education, adding: "Now they get all these benefits. They have these incredible teachers and schools and they don't have to have shame about it. They understand that their brain functions in a different way.
