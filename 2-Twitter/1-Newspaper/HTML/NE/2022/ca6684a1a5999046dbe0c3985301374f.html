                    <div class="article-content"><p>Ryan Reynolds hopes to make a 'Deadpool' Christmas movie "one day".</p><p>The 46-year-old actor revealed he had worked on a festive saga about the Merc with a Mouth but the project got shelved after Disney bought 20th Century Fox, though Ryan hasn't given up hope of the project eventually being filmed at some point in the future.</p><p>He told The Big Issue magazine: "Four years ago, ['Deadpool' co-writers] Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and I wrote a Christmas movie starring Deadpool. But it got lost in the shuffle of Disney acquiring Fox and it never got made.</p><p>"Maybe one day we'll get to make that movie. It's not a musical, but it's a full Deadpool Christmas movie. So one day."</p><p>Ryan will next be working on 'Deadpool 3', and was delighted to have Hugh Jackman agree to return as Wolverine for the film after asking him "for six straight years".</p><p>He added: "It was ultimately Hugh that said, 'I think I am ready to come back.'</p><p>"All we had to do was sell it to (producer) Kevin Feige, which didn't take long, and the next thing you knew here we are."</p><p>Filming for 'Deadpool 3' has not yet started yet but Shawn Levy is set to direct the sequel while Rhett and Paul are to write the script.</p><p>Rhett previously told fans not to "worry" about the fear the third instalment could be Disney-fied after Disney bought its producer 20th Century Fox.</p><p>But he has added: "Now when it comes to a particular joke, if we cross a line, maybe we'll hear at some point, 'Maybe not that joke.'</p><p>"But I think they've been incredibly supportive of what we're doing, because obviously we were doing it separate from them for a long time, and I think they've seen the success and they've had their own even greater success. So hopefully it'll be a marriage made in heaven. But we've definitely got their support, and that's a great thing to feel."</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_2" class="gallery-item-9fa56ec7-96b1-54cf-9b6d-cf179d0fa5ce" data-item="2"></a>

                    <div class="article-content"><p>Adele will be performing her Las Vegas residency on New Year's Eve.</p><p>The 34-year-old singer postponed her stint at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in January just 24 hours before the opening night and claimed COVID-19 had rendered her show impossible to put on but eventually opened 'Weekends With Adele' on Friday (18.11.22) and has already added two new shows to the otherwise sold-out run towards the end of the festive period.</p><p>She wrote on Instagram: "New Years Eve has always been a let down for me, I seem to always end up spending it in a car on my way to or from somewhere! But not this year!! I'll be ringing 2023 in on stage!! I dress up to the nines on NYE and I would love it if those of you that come would too! Let's go all out black tie vibes"(sic)</p><p>The news comes just days after the 'Easy On Me' hitmaker - who is set to perform in Sin City until March 2023 - revealed that she had "never been more nervous" ahead of opening night.</p><p>She wrote: "I'm highly emotional, incredibly nervous but can't sit still because I'm so excited. I feel a million miles away from home, I can't stop thinking about when I was little and saw Tom Jones in Mars Attacks and thought blimey how did he get from Wales to Las Vegas!?" I always get scared before shows, and I take it as a good sign because it means I care and means I just want to do a good job. Maybe it's because I didn't start when I was supposed to. Maybe it's because it's opening night, maybe it's because Hyde Park went so great, maybe its because I love the show I don't know. But it's safe to say I've never been more nervous before a show in my career, but at the same time I wish today was tomorrow. I can't wait to see you out there x."(sic)</p><p>The new dates will take place on December 30 and December 31, with Ticketmaster's Verified Fan presale taking place from 10am P.T on November 23.</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_3" class="gallery-item-9fa56ec7-96b1-54cf-9b6d-cf179d0fa5ce" data-item="3"></a>

                    <div class="article-content"><p>Camila Cabello originally auditioned for 'The Voice.'</p><p>The 25-year-old pop star initially found fame on 'The X Factor USA' in 2012 as part of girl group Fifth Harmony before going on to a solo career but revealed that her first stab at success came in the form of an audition for the rival talent show she now serves as a judge on.</p><p>She said: "The truth is - I actually did audition for 'The Voice'. I'm not even sure I can say the story. I did make it in the producer round, not the TV round. I never auditioned for the coaches!"</p><p>The 'Don't Go Yet' hitmaker went on to explain that she eventually decided not to continue with 'The Voice' because she was a big fan of boy band One Direction - who were put together on the British version of 'The X Factor' - and hoped to meet them.</p><p>She told Access Hollywood: "And then I was like, I really wanted to meet One Direction, and I knew that they were gonna perform for 'X Factor'. So I was like, 'I'm just gonna risk it and not do 'The Voice' and audition for 'X Factor.' And then I did end up meeting One Direction! It was a pretty wild move!! It's like it was a magnet though, I was meant to be back."</p><p>Earlier this year, Camila performed 'Havana' on 'The Voice' alongside fellow judges Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, and John Legend and admitted it was a "really cool" experience.</p><p>She said: "They're such incredible artists I feel almost embarrassed that they sang my song. But it was really cool. We did like one quick 15-minute rehearsal [during lunch], which was cool because we didn't have time to overthink things. The next day we performed it, we ran over it a few times and then we [filmed] it."</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_4" class="gallery-item-9fa56ec7-96b1-54cf-9b6d-cf179d0fa5ce" data-item="4"></a>

I write all the time. I love handwritten letters. I just hope and pray she gets them. I know for sure before she wasn't [in the past], so I'm very hopeful that she gets them [now]."</p><p>Felicia - who made a cameo appearance as Britney's schoolteacher in the music video for her debut single '...Baby One More Time' in 1998 - added that "karma" will play a part in the aftermath of the #FreeBritney movement, and sent her well wishes to Britney following her wedding to actor Sam Asghari in June.</p><p>She told the New York Post's PageSix column: "It does feel like karma. Karma will get every single thing that was bad -- karma will take care of [it]. I have faith in that. But I'm very grateful that Brit has gotten her own words back, and her own voice. That makes me happy. I just hope that her wedding and all the good things that are happening in her life make her as happy as we want her to be."</p><p>Earlier this year, the 'Toxic' hitmaker claimed that she had watched Felicia take part in the 'Framing Britney Spears' documentary and took to social media to accuse her former assistant of lying throughout the programme.</p><p>She tweeted: "The best part to me was when my old assistant talked about how I went through the neighborhood passing out 100 dollar bills when my first song came out. I wish I could go inside the heads of people like my dad and her and really try to understand why people lie and make up such things like that!"</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div id="gallery_item_ad_4" class="item-ad text-center" style="min-height: 311px"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_5" class="gallery-item-9fa56ec7-96b1-54cf-9b6d-cf179d0fa5ce" data-item="5"></a>

The chemistry between them is electrifying and everyone around them can see this. They are both passionate about their music and Jesse treats Billie with so much respect and admiration. He does not look at her as a superstar or anything like that. Billie and Jesse have known each other for years so even though they've only been dating a short while, she feels very comfortable with him. llie knows fans may be concerned over their age difference, but it really isn't a concern of hers because they connect on so many levels. Plus, she's turning 21 in a few months so there won't be as many restrictions in terms of where they can hang out because she'll be old enough at that point.. Billie respects Jesse as a person. Not only is he very successful as an artist, but he's also incredibly smart and funny, and he treats her with nothing but respect.

And I won't be shamed for it.</p><p>"I had a blast. Anderson had a blast. We left and we were like 'That was fun! What a fun New Year's Eve.'

                    <div class="article-content"><p>Jay Leno is "feeling much better" as he recovers from severe burns, according to his longtime friend Tim Allen.</p><p>The 72-year-old former 'Tonight Show' host suffered "significant" injuries after one of his vintage cars burst into flames in his garage last Saturday (12.11.22) - he has undergone skin graft surgery and is now recovering in a specialist burns unit in Los Angeles where he was visited by his pal Tim.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="http://TMZ.com">TMZ.com</a>, Tim insisted Jay is in good spirits saying: "He's feeling better. We did some jokes, which is what we do. We commiserated."</p><p>Tim went on to explain Jay's face won't be disfigured after the accident, but joked he will come out of hospital looking like actor George Clooney.</p><p>He added: "He's handsome and he's happy. The hospital is doing a great job taking care of him."</p><p>Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon and medical director of Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in Los Angeles previously revealed Jay had undergone skin graft surgery saying: "He has undergone one surgery so far. He did well with that surgery. He is in good spirits today." Peter confirmed Jay - who is an avid car collector - has "significant" and "deep" second-degree burns and "possibly" some third-degree burns following the incident, but revealed the TV host has been walking around the hospital and making jokes. The surgeon added in a press briefing: "Our hope is that when everything is all said and done, he will do well. "But burn injuries are progressive and dynamic and it's hard to predict ultimately what the final outcome will be at this stage in the game. "He seems to be a gentleman who really just does not want to make a big deal of this. He wants to move forward and he wants to get back to work. "I had to tell him that he needs to step it back a little bit and just realise that some of [this] takes time."</p><p>After the accident, Jay released a statement assuring fans he was alright. Jay said: "I got some serious burns from a gasoline fire. I am OK. Just need a week or two to get back on my feet."</p></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><a name="anchor_item_30" class="gallery-item-9fa56ec7-96b1-54cf-9b6d-cf179d0fa5ce" data-item="30"></a>

That's not his style."</p><p>An official cause of death has yet to be determined, but police reportedly found multiple cans of compressed air and bottles of prescription pills at the scene.</p><p>Aaron has been cremated and his death certificate revealed his ashes will be held by his twin sister, Angel Carter.</p><p>The public release of the document comes shortly after Angel and her brother, Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter, launched a new mental health initiative for children in memory of his their late sibling, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and publicly battled with his mental health.</p><p>Nick, 42, and Angel, 34, who were somewhat estranged from Aaron, are raising funds for the organisation On Our Sleeves, which aims to end stigmas around children's mental health.</p><p>On his Instagram Story, Nick announced: "Very grateful for the outpour(ing) of love and support for my brother.

It's all kind of the same tools that need to be applied in a consistent way."</p><p>Chris also plans to discuss his health issues with his children.</p><p>He shared: "One day I'm sure I'll bring it up.

And if any of that can help people - seeing Kourtney's journey through IVF, which is super hard for a woman.

It just bothered me, like, these people that, you know, [are on the] production [team] are, like, making the choice of what my story is."</p><p>Kourtney understands why TV bosses chose to focus on Scott's reaction - but she was still "bothered" by how it was portrayed on screen.</p><p>She said: "I think it just bothered me because I felt like this is my fairy tale. Yeah. And I was like, 'Why can't we show the happy, the happy ending? Why do we have to focus on this?' And I get it's TV and blah, blah, blah. To me, I was not having it.

                    <div class="article-content"><p>Will Smith personally paid extras who played dead bodies on the ground in new film 'Emancipation'.</p><p>The upcoming movie's director Antoine Fuqua has heaped praise on the 54-year-old actor and hailed him as the "nicest person he's ever met", particularly with the way he treated the extras who found themselves lying around in extreme heat as part of the shoot.</p><p>He told Vanity Fair magazine: "He was kind to everyone on the set. Will would go around and hug and shake hands - we had 300-something extras and military. Marines.</p><p>"He's funny. He's fun. We had certain extras that were the dead bodies in the graves, and he would go give them money for laying there in that heat over 100 degrees.</p><p>"I have nothing but amazing things to say about Will Smith, really genuinely. You can ask anybody that worked on the movie, they'll tell you the same. Nicest person I've ever met in my life."</p><p>The movie - which follows a man who escapes slavery - was filmed before Will hit Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith at this year's Oscars.</p><p>Fuqua has defended the decision to still release the film, describing the project as a whole as "more important than one bad moment" and noting there was never a conversation "about the movie not coming out".</p><p>He added: "Of course I wanted people to see the film. My conversation was always, 'Isn't 400 years of slavery, of brutality, more important than one bad moment?' "</p><p>Last month, Will blamed being "fogged out" and "fuzzy" for not saying sorry to Chris at the time.</p><p>The Hollywood star resigned from the Academy in the wake of the row and was subsequently banned from the Oscars and all of the organisation's events for the next decade.</p><p>Will said: "I've reached out to Chris and the message that came back is that he's not ready to talk ... when he is, he will reach out.

I couldn't leave my room without someone coming up to me calling me True Jackson. What you are, to everyone, is just a character… just part of their experience."</p><p>The show ran from 2008 until 2011, and Keke - who rose to fame as True Jackson - has gone onto star in the likes of 'Scream Queens', 'Hustlers' and 'Nope'.</p><p>On the latter - which was directed by Jordan Peele - she said: "People don't realise what it took to even get to the point where I could play that part.</p><p>"Nobody would have seen me playing that role if it hadn't been for all the things that I'd done prior, so I'm proud of it for more reasons than one."</p><p>Keke - whose real first name is Lauren - explained she also had a separation between her true self in private, and what she lets the public see.</p><p>She added: "I'm a quirky artist, but I'm an artist, and it's important for people to understand that Keke is just a part of who I am.</p><p>"It's been a winding road of trying to figure out how to do what I love but also exist outside of this caricature."</p><p>She noted it's as simple as her not being "like that all the time".</p><p>She said: "I've taken those flamboyant and interesting aspects of myself and learned how to use them in a space that has become a career for me.

This the brilliant side of him. What is his next plan? To run for office, right. I'm just sayin'! From our knowledge, his next plan is to run for office, right? Who was his main endorser? Trump.</p><p>"In order for Kanye to have a shot, he needs to have a piece of that base. This is how he's getting it. And he knows this!"</p><p>The 49-year-old singer acknowledged Kanye has angered the Black community with his recent antics but thinks they are forgiving people and will ultimately support him.</p><p>He added: "He knows he's gonna make a lotta Black people angry. But, guess what? We're forgiving people. We are. He knows that, too."</p><p>The 'Lonely' hitmaker insisted he will always be supportive of Kanye, who ran for president in 2020 but conceded his run after winning just 50,000 votes and failing to make the ballot in several states.</p><p>Speaking to sports analyst and former NFL player Shannon Sharpe on 'Club Shay Shay', Akon said: "I'm always defending the people that nobody wants to defend.</p><p>"I'ma always defend Kanye West because I always believe in life and opinion is just an opinion.
