        The jury in Donald Trump's historic criminal trial has reached a verdict. The seven men and five women made a decision on whether to find the former President guilty or innocent on 34 counts of falsifying business records. It comes after five weeks of dramatic evidence and 22 witnesses being quizzed on the stand The case is the first time a former U.S. President has faced a criminal trial. Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential candidate and is set to take on Joe Biden in November's election. It means the verdict could upend the 2024 White House race and prove a pivotal moment in the history of the United States.

                The verdict is in, and Donald Trump is the first former president in U.S. history to ever be convicted of a crime. A New York jury found the ex-president and Republican presidential nominee guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records and he will be sentenced on July 11. Trump’s legal team is expected to appeal, but the unprecedented conviction sets off a process that all convicted criminals face within the Manhattan criminal court system. Despite his conviction, he can still run for president and is expected to furiously campaign before his expected rematch with President Joe Biden. The judge has discretion when it comes to sentencing. So will he face jail or will he get probation?

                Donald Trump becomes the first ever former President of the United States to be convicted of a crime. A unanimous New York jury found him guilty on all 34 counts of illegally trying to cover up a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to stifle a sex scandal that he feared would derail his 2016 presidential campaign only days before America went to the polls. Paying the hush money was not in itself illegal but the prosecution successfully argued that it was designed to influence the outcome of the election - a violation of election laws and, argued the prosecutors, the underlying crime.

      With less than five weeks until the General Election, the research shared exclusively with the Daily Mail found only four in ten have 'definitely decided' how to vote. But in a sign of the mountain the Tories still have to climb, the poll gives Labour a 23 point lead. Overall, it puts Labour on a 47 per cent vote share, with the Tories on 24 per cent, and Reform UK on 11 per cent. The poll also suggests Sir Keir Starmer and Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves are more trusted with running the economy than the Prime Minister and Jeremy Hunt.

                EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Famed for his catchphrase 'Who lives in a house like this?' - Loyd Grossman will no doubt be waking up to a feeling of pure marital bliss in his own home today. As I am delighted to disclose that the former Through The Keyhole presenter has this week married Melissa Knatchbull; seven years after they went public with their relationship. Melissa, 63, the ex-wife of Earl Mountbatten of Burma's grandson Michael, had long remained quiet on their union - once telling me: 'I make it a policy not to talk about my private life.' Yet the Four Weddings And A Funeral star is clearly a fan of Grossman's nasal mid-Atlantic drawl and perhaps also his pasta sauces which have made him a £50 million fortune.

       This is the moment Fiona Bruce was forced to stop a row between Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan on Question Time after the Reform UK chief was accused of 'bottling' not standing for election. Farage and Morgan appeared on the BBC One show on Thursday to take part in a fiery debate ahead of the general election on July 4. The two came to verbal blows after the former Ukip leader was asked by a member of the audience why he wasn't standing, despite being named as the honorary president of the Reform UK party. Earlier this week, Farage said Rishi Sunak 's decision to go to the polls much earlier than most had expected was the reason why he was not standing as a candidate. But before the 60-year-old had a chance to say this to the Question Time audience, Morgan shouted at him: 'You bottled it mate.' Barking back at the presenter, Farage criticised his counterpart's media career and said: 'Piers you have never stood in your life. You are not even a TV presenter.'

       Sarah Rigby, 41, (right) made NHS project manager Gareth Jones, 40, (pictured) eat salad, wear a hat and swallow toothpaste and mouthwash in the wrongful belief he was fat, bald and had halitosis. Rigby's abuse against her boyfriend included stopping him from showering or using the toilet in the house, and making him sleep on the floor with no duvet as a punishment. She stopped him from seeing family and friends, and if he didn't comply with her orders she would even stop him from eating. Rigby was handed a 20 month sentence suspended for two years. She is also required to complete 35 days of rehabilitation and was handed a five-year restraining order.

                Georgie Campbell, 37, died after falling at a fence during the International Horse Trials on Sunday. She was married to fellow equestrian Jesse Campbell, a member of the New Zealand team for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. The pair joined personal and professional forces to create Team Campbell Eventing. In a post on a social media page for Team Campbell Eventing, Mr Campbell shared an image of his wife with the caption: 'I love you so, so much.' He added: 'This is my favorite photo of my beautiful wife. It's from our wedding day in 2021 and it was the best day ever. People will talk about G's smile, and it was incredible - it would make you feel like you were the centre of the universe.'

                President Joe Biden's campaign pounced on former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict by saying 'no one is above the law' but warned Republicans wouldn't replace him on the ballot. 'Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,' said communications director Michael Tyler. 'There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box.'

                Hollywood was quick to react as the jury in Donald Trump´s criminal hush money trial has found the former president guilty of all 34 felony counts against him. Kathy Griffin said she was crying 'TEARS OF JOY' in the wake of the verdict. John Cusack said, The dumb treacherous criminal is now a convicted felon - 34 times over. Now what will judge do with Trump contempt violations.'

                A heavy pro-Trump crowd took to the streets outside Manhattan Criminal Court on Thursday as the world awaits the jury's verdict, before a handful of protestors squared off in furious scenes. In one crazed moment during the scuffle, a woman exposed her breasts and flashed them in the face of a protestor while they were being hauled away by police. One Trump supporter Lily Qi, 60, told DailyMail.com: 'We are praying to God he is not guilty. This case is totally wrong.' It comes as analysts believe the jury may return with a verdict on Thursday, in a groundbreaking moment that could see the presidential front runner become a convicted felon.

       EXCLUSIVE: New video footage has revealed the moment a hitman on a stolen motorbike opened fire on a Turkish restaurant in Dalston. The CCTV obtained by MailOnline shows the shooter slowly approaching Evin's on Kingsland High Street before coming to a stop outside. He then whips out a loaded weapon and fires six times in the direction of the diners, as a nearby cyclists turns his head in utter disbelief at what he is seeing. The motorcyclist then speeds away, leaving three Turkish men, who are alleged to be the target of the attack injured and a nine-year-old girl caught in the crossfire fighting for her life.

                On any other night it might have been Kate Moss in a leotard that commanded attention, but on Tuesday it was the man walking alongside her who claimed the spotlight. The supermodel was joined by a hitherto unknown male companion during a night out at London's Playhouse Theatre, where they paid a visit to the popular Kit Kat Club. Kate, 50, ensured she stood out by wearing a black leotard that accentuated her slender physique as she watched close friend Cara Delevingne deliver her latest performance as sally Bowles in Cabaret.

       The accused arrived handcuffed in pairs in shorts and T-shirts in two police vans and were taken into the court building in the island capital Palma by armed cops. The four men in the second Civil Guard van that arrived, around 5.30pm local time (4.30pm BST), used their free hands to cover up their faces with their T-shirts. They said nothing as they went in. The court hearing is now taking place behind closed doors, as is normal in Spain . The accused are expected to be released on bail pending an ongoing probe following questioning in the court, but no decision will be taken until later.

                The travellers were removed from the cricket field at Petersfield Cricket club in Hampshire, which is said to have been severely damaged. Club Captain Chris Russell told MailOnline: 'Last night we had some unexpected visitors. On our CCTV two four by four Ford Rangers were doing doughnuts on our out field.' The club has set up a fundraiser to repair the damage caused by the circling vehicles, which has so far raised nearly £1,000.

                Beal was jailed for life today with a minimum term of 20 years after she lured builder Nick Billingham, 42, into the bedroom with the promise of sex before 'executing' him in the Northampton home they shared. Yvonne Valentine, Mr Billingham's mother, received text messages from her son's phone and even went for a festive drink at the couple's house in the period after his death, in a move Judge Mark Lucraft, KC called 'truly callous'. The heartbroken mother revealed that her son's killer's guilty plea was 'so much of a relief', but said the family were left in disbelief after Mr Billingham's death.

       This is the moment police raided an unassuming north London corner shop where a group of Bulgarian fraudsters had masterminded the UK's biggest ever benefit scam. The gang-of-five were jailed for more than 25 years today after they hijacked 6,000 identities to rake in £54million in bogus Universal Credit claims, using the names of children living in Bulgaria as part of the five year scam. The Eastern European group set up three 'benefit factories' across London to churn out bogus tenancy agreements, counterfeit payslips and forged letters from landlords, employers, and GPs to trick the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). Footage released by the Crown Prosecution Service shows officers entering Antonia's Foods supermarket in Wood Green - a functioning corner shop which allowed the group to hide in plain sight whilst they carried out their criminal activities. Upon raiding the store, police discovered computers, some open on the Universal Credit application page, filing cabinets full of claim packs, and folders containing records on benefit claims. The force also found several hundred low-tech mobile phones, all being charged, alongside thousands of SIM cards. Most of these devices had the names and claim number of the applicant who had used it.

                They were the baby-faced troublemakers who terrorised Britain's streets. From the infamous 'Asbros' who brought mayhem to their community, to the 'Ratboy' burglar who received his first caution at the age of 10, the notorious 'ASBO Kids' became the poster boys for youth street crime . The ASBO, or anti-social behavioural order, was introduced by Sir Tony Blair 's Government in 1998 as a way to deter crime by putting a curfew on an individual and banning them from certain places. But for many yobs it became a badge of honour, and more than half of those who received one would breach its conditions. The ASBOs were scrapped in 2014 and replaced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by civil injunctions and criminal behaviour orders. Left, Danny and Ricky Oakley. Right, Anthony Kennedy. Top inset, Alfie Hodgin. Bottom inset, Calvin Hooper and his brother Kyle.

       Channel 4 Dispatches documentary The Truth About Temu explores accusations of data-harvesting and insufficient safety checks on products which appear on the Chinese retailer's site. Known for selling anything from children's clothing to BB guns at a dirt-cheap price, Temu company has grown massively since it launched less than two years ago. It is a website that provides a platform for thousands of Chinese businesses to sell their products. The app has around 15million UK users and generates profit by cutting out the middleman, with the merchants sending the item directly to the buyer. Temu's parent company is worth an estimated £170bn. But concerns have been raised after 11-year-old Chloe Norris was left in hospital after her father bought her an at-home manicure set from the online outlet. Chloe, from Kent, (pictured left and right) was left with severe third-degree burns after she bought the nail glue with her own money at the beginning of December. Channel 4 Dispatches investigative reporter Ellie Flynn (bottom inset) set out to explore the quality and safety of its products and uncovered many concerning things about the items you are putting into your shopping cart (top inset, a gold chain being sold on Temu).

                Tom Parry, 49, and his 12-year-old son Richie climbed the UK's highest mountain on Monday before travelling to Glencoe in the Scottish highlands on Tuesday, where they set off amid thundery skies. The experienced hikers had been due to return to their Cheshire home in Alsager on Wednesday but have not been seen or heard from. On Thursday police said they recovered two bodies in their urgent search for the pair. Posting a tribute to the pair on Facebook earlier today, one fellow walker claimed she had seen Mr Parry and his son at the summit of Ben Nevis and they had been 'proud' to make it to the top.

                I doubt there's a mother of teenage boys in the land whose heart didn't plummet as she read that Loaded magazine is to return to reassure men they can 'ogle beautiful women'. Give us a break. What reassurance do poor, downtrodden men need when they can ogle (virtually) naked beautiful women on every red carpet? Or, at the flick of a switch, watch endless online porn? After a nine-year hiatus, the rebranded Loaded World will return with the stated aim of recreating the nostalgic - or retrograde, in my opinion - feel of the title which folded in 2015 as competition from the internet and changing tastes sounded the death knell for so-called 'lads' mags'.

       'It is our Prime Minister, Rishi SUMAK.' While hitting the campaign trail hard earlier today, the weary PM got a rather awkward intro from a fellow Tory candidate when he hilariously mispronounced his name. Despite cringingly stating earlier in his speech that Sunak was his 'tech bro from another mo'. However, nothing was going to stop Sunak proudly storming into the room, all laughs and smiles, waving unabashedly at the crowd.

                JANET STREET-PORTER: Maybe it's shallow and unfair to judge someone by the cut of their trousers (Rishi's ankle swingers) or their spooky dark shirts - but if you're battling for the top job in British politics, what you've chosen to wear on the campaign trail really matters. Clothing reveals so much about personality and can reinforce your brand, but our leaders are stuck in the stone age. Britain is the style capital of the world, no doubt about that. So why do our leaders look like a couple of middle management nobodies?

       Faisa Shaheen said she will challenge a decision made last night to prevent her from running against former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green. The former supporter of Jeremy Corbyn accused Labour of having 'a problem with black and brown people' and said she had been subjected to 'a systematic campaign of racism, Islamophobia and bullying'. It came as Sir Keir Starmer found his party at the centre of a row over attempts to remove of several election candidates, including veteran MP Diane Abbott.

                The unpublished memoirs of Alan Fisher, a man from the slums of Manchester who rose to become one of the most sought after butlers in the world, are going under the hammer, along with an unseen photo of Edward in royal robes, as if dressing up as a king, with Wallis at his side (left). The memoirs lift the lid on high society courtesy of a man who served royalty, the rich and famous and describe Wallis (right) as a woman who would have been 'Queen Dictator' if she'd ever ascended the throne.

                Businesses in Magaluf are worried about the lack of holidaymakers in the party city in the lead-up to the busy holiday season.  Photos show Magaluf, one of Majorca's busiest cities, is still half-empty days before tourists are meant to be flooding its streets, bringing with them much-needed spending money.  The Majorca Daily Bulletin reported that businesses are anxious about whether enough tourists will come to the island.

       The commotion unfolded at the Nao Pool Club in Marbella, when a crowd of revellers spilled into the car park. A security team dressed in black trousers and white polo-necks were dispatched to calm the situation, but one particularly burly guard took umbrage when a slender woman in a green dress appeared to swing her handbag at him. Blocking her bag, he retaliated with a violent slap that clouted the side of her head, and moments later launched an even more erratic swing at a second woman who came to her defence, hitting her square on the cheek and sending her stumbling away. A British tourist who recorded the incident also appeared to catch on film how one of the bouncer's colleagues surged into the crowd, attempting to seize the phones of shocked onlookers who had also filmed the slaps.

                Even though it was more than 15 years ago, I clearly remember looking round the primary school I had set my heart on for my firstborn son, Jacob. Despite being in North London , it was set amid green fields, with a huge playground and outdoor space for all the classrooms. I was sold. But when I told one of my snootier friends, she reeled in horror. 'You're sending him to state school?' she sneered incredulously. It was as if I had announced I was letting my five-year-old loose in a crack den. This is a reaction I have encountered so many times over the years - and I know I am not alone.

                Natalie Portman and Paul Mescal couldn't control their giggles as they enjoyed an evening out drinking at at Bar 69 in Islington, London on Tuesday.  The actors - who met last year when they interviewed each other for Variety magazine - looked in high spirits as they headed outside for a cigarette. Natalie, 42, was no doubt pleased to have a fun night out having quietly finalised her divorce from Benjamin Millepied (inset) in March following rumours he was unfaithful. Meanwhile, Paul, 28, has made no secret of his admiration for Natalie so was clearly delighted to be in her company.

       Richard Madeley has been mocked by GMB viewers after having another 'Alan Partridge' moment.  The 68-year-old presenter is often compared to Steve Coogan's tactless character, and drew parallels yet again on Thursday during an interview with Kerry Katona.  Kerry, 43, appeared on the breakfast news show to discuss her new nose job after drug abuse left her with a hole in her septum.

        Ireland has long enjoyed a reputation as the land of 'a hundred thousand welcomes'. But with record numbers arriving, there's a backlash - and it's clear the state is struggling to find accommodation.

                The cruel stunt, filmed by Reynolds' streamer pals and later shared on Reddit, shows the influencer encouraging the woman to jump into a lake before mocking her. Viewers have responded to the clip by telling Reynolds to 'get f***ed' while others described her as 'narcissistic' and 'absolutely horrible'.

       Race Across The World gripped viewers as the winners of its fourth series were crowned during Wednesday night's episode after a gruelling eight week challenge. Five teams of two were tasked with racing to the island of Lombok in Indonesia via a series of checkpoints, with friends Alfie and Owen ultimately taking the win. However, while the challenge appears undoubtedly tough on screen, previous contestants and crew members have lifted the lid on the behind-the-scenes secrets.

                Hollywood actor-turned-Putin mouthpiece Steven Seagal has made the bizarre claim that Ukraine was known for 'organ trafficking, child sex trafficking and Nazism', as the Russian leader himself gave the sycophant the nation's Order of Friendship.  In a ceremony at the Yekaterininsky Hall of the Kremlin in Moscow today, Seagal, 72, was presented the honour for his 'big contribution to development of international cultural and humanitarian cooperation' in his role as an envoy to the US.  He claimed in his speech after Putin personally pinned the medal on his chest: 'Before the special operation, Ukraine was known for human trafficking, organ trafficking, narcotrafficking, child sex trafficking, biochemical warfare labs, fascism, and Nazism.

                Sue Hambley's one-year-old pet Ralphie was left with his 'leg hanging off' after being mauled by a hound that slipped its lead and muzzle in a park in Kent on May 20. Police have not yet confirmed the breed of the vicious dog - but Miss Hambley and neighbours believe it to be an XL bully. The dog in question has now been seized by officers following the 'horrendous' attack at Victoria Park in Ashford, Kent. Recalling the terrifying incident that left blood spattered across her clothes and the road, Miss Hambley said: 'We passed a few women with young children and a dog with a muzzle on. As we walked past, it sort of growled and barked at Ralph, but we just took no notice, as he was on a lead.'

                Pensioners who face a choice between staying on the road or giving up driving thanks to rising insurance costs are being urged to renew in the 'sweet spot' to slash the cost of cover. While most drivers have faced higher renewal quotes in recent years, pensioners on tight budgets could be tempted to quit driving altogether if rises are too big to manage and as such, lose some of their freedom.

                Jurgen Klopp has offered an insight into what his retirement could look like on the sunny Spanish island of Majorca - but the former Liverpool boss (right) isn't done with management yet. The German, 56, has bought a villa (left) on the Balearic island for £3.4million and plans to create 'an ecological family paradise' there. It would be the perfect place to unwind with wife Ulla (inset, bottom right) and his family after admitting he left Liverpool because he was 'running out of energy.'

        Heralding the return of warm weather by wearing florals doesn't sound like anything new. But don't dismiss this trend out of hand, because this year it does have something more to offer.

                This rainforest-themed brainteaser challenges you to spot the hidden snake in seconds - so, are you ready to scale up to the challenge? In celebration of World Environment Day, sustainability experts have slithered in with a fun challenge that's bound to twist your brain. World Environment Day, which is observed annually on June 5th, is the perfect occasion to appreciate the planet's natural wonders, while encouraging awareness and action to protect the earth from climate change, pollution and deforestation. This year, BusinessWaste.co.uk is marking the day with a brainteaser that highlights the Amazon, one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems. According to the creators, the average time to solve the puzzle is 2 minutes and 28 seconds, but the record to beat is a swift 25 seconds. How will you measure up?

                Gordon Ramsay has finally returned to his family home in Wandsworth after two years of renovations.  The celebrity chef, 57, and his wife Tana, 49, were spotted returning to the south London mansion on Wednesday which they bought for in 2002 for £2.8million.  Now worth £7million, the home has undergone a number of renovations over the years, including a single storey outbuilding in the garden and a temporary pig enclosure.

                Ben Affleck was every inch the doting father as he brought his son Samuel to school in Los Angeles amid rumors he is living apart from his wife Jennifer Lopez. While doing the morning drop-off at his 12-year-old's school, the 51-year-old Oscar winner looked a bit exhausted as he carried an iced coffee in one hand for a much-needed pick-me-up. The Gone Girl star bundled up for the outing as he sported a red jacket with a sherpa lined hood over a light grey zip-up and blue t-shirt. He completed his laid-back look with a pair of light blue jeans, a black belt buckle and a pair of stylish sneakers.

                Mourners including King Charles and Queen Camilla gathered to pay their respects to former Arsenal chairman Sir Chippendale 'Chips' Keswick who died in April, aged 84. The Queen attended the service in support of her and the King's dear friend Lady Sarah Keswick. Sir Chips was an eminent banker and scion of the family which controls Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong - based business empire. The businessman joined Arsenal's board alongside Lord Harris in November 2005. He stepped down in May 2020 after overseeing a streak of good luck with the team winning four FA Cups. Keswick had previously been a vice-chairman of Hambros bank between 1986 and 1998 and was knighted by the Queen for services to banking in 1993.

                King Felipe looked 'less assured' when appearing alongside his wife at a board meeting with the patrons of The Gallery Of The Royal Collections in Madrid today, according to Judi James. The body language expert told FEMAIL that mother-of-two Letizia, 51, displayed a proud posture, raised chin and a 'regal and warm gaze' - but Felipe, 56, sported a 'weak but warm-looking smile' and held his arms 'awkwardly at his sides'. Their joint appearance comes after journalist Jaime Peñafiel, 91, launched a fresh attack on the European Queen with his new book 'Letizia's Silences', which was was published in Spain this week. Following his first best-selling book 'Letizia & I' (which alleged that Letizia had an affair with her ex brother-in-law Jamie del Burgo ), the veteran royal reporter claims in his latest work that Felipe was 'aware' of his wife's alleged infidelity 'in real time'.

       Lawyers for Christopher Gregor, 32, claim six-year-old Corey died of 'infection' despite a doctor's findings that the little boy died from blunt impact injury. The New Jersey man was seen forcing his son to run on a treadmill, even picking him up and placing him back on the machine, in the weeks before his death. Gregor has been charged with first-degree murder and endangering the welfare of a child. However, his defense team argues that Corey died from 'natural causes' and that the prosecution failed to prove the boy died in the way medical officials maintain. 'There's no winner here. Corey died. That's it. Nobody had anything to do with it,' attorney Mario Galluci said in court on Wednesday.

       Wilshere and his wife Andriani Michael welcomed daughter Siena just a year after their wedding in June 2017 - but noticed that she was always coughing shortly after her first birthday. During a family holiday in Cyprus, a doctor detected a heart murmur and urged the family to take Siena to see a cardiologist - where they discovered that Siena had a hole in her heart. Recalling the terrifying phone call he had with his wife, Wilshere told the BBC: 'I was preparing to travel with the team, my team, for a game like we normally do any my phone rang.'

       A quiz show contestant hit out at conspiracy theorists who accused him of cheating on a popular TV quiz show - and insisted he was just adjusting his earring. Father-of-two Jason Duckett (pictured), 36, dismissed claims he had tried to influence the outcome of The 1% Club by rubbing his ears to signal an answer. He told of his shock after discovering wild theories had emerged online as the apparent 'gesture' was made as host Lee Mack asked a question which had the correct answer 'ear' and 'hear'.

                National Geographic Traveller has revealed the winners of its 12th annual photography competition, showcasing the most beautiful and powerful images taken by British and Irish photographers who travelled across land and sea to capture them.  The winners of the competition, who travelled as far as Antarctica and as near as London's Chinatown, were made up of amateur and professional photographers alike, who each took breathtaking images from across the world.  The photos each portray a unique side to the world, both natural and man-made, that tells a different story of progress, preservation, belief, wonder and much more.

                Jena Sims left little to the imagination while practising her golf swing on a glamorous getaway to the Bahamas.  The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model shared a snap of herself rocking a green bikini as her husband, Brooks Koepka, watched on.  'Après golf,' she captioned the Instagram post Thursday, which showed her swinging a club while barefoot.

It was just as chaotic for Isi Gabsa the same morning, despite her tee shot hitting the green at the first time of asking.
