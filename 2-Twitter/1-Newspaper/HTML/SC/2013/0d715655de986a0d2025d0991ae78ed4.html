	The Greenwood Shrine Club and City of Greenwood will welcome
the Hejaz Shriners 2023 Fall Ceremonial on October 28, 2023.  Everyone is invited to come help celebrate
the awesome time.  Kicking off the event
will be a parade beginning at 10 a.m. from Main St. Baptist Church and ending
at Fat Daddys BBQ.  Then at 6 p.m. the band
Month of Mondays will perform un the Uptown Market on 220 Maxwell Ave where
refreshments, food truck and cash bar will be available.
		
	This will be an awesome time for the entire family to
enjoy.  The Greenwood Shriners do a lot of
events throughout the year that many of you enjoy.  They work hard to raise funds to support the
Shriners Hospital who helps so many children. 
		
	As great way to show them support is by coming out to the
parade and concert and make this years ceremony the best ever.

She held memberships in the American College of Healthcare Executives, the South Carolina Health Alliance, Sigma Theta Tau (the National Honor Society of Nursing), and National Association of Long-Term Hospitals.

"As a retired healthcare executive, I have experienced the benefits and necessity of technical education. Hospitals and healthcare facilities cannot operate without these skilled professionals.”
		 
		Butler earned her master of science in nursing from Clemson University and her bachelor of science in nursing from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.

	A Greenwood man was sentenced to 15 years in prison after
pleading guilty to a drug trafficking charge right before his trial was to
start on Thursday morning, 8th Circuit Solicitor David M. Stumbo announced
today.
		
	Antonio Lamar Gary, 41, of Greenwood, pleaded guilty to
one count of trafficking heroin, which exposed him to up to 20 years in prison.
A jury had already been selected on Wednesday afternoon, and pretrial motions
completed, when Gary elected to change his plea from not guilty to guilty.
		
	Circuit Judge R. Keith Kelly sentenced to Gary to 15
years in prison, with no possibility of parole. Gary has a criminal history
with drug related charges dating back more than two decades. The crime is
classified as violent and serious under state law and Gary must serve a minimum
of 85 percent.
		
	
	In June 2019, deputies with the Greenwood County
Sheriff’s Office performed a traffic stop on a vehicle after observing no
working taillights. Gary was located in the passenger seat of the vehicle.
Deputies observed both Gary and the driver of the vehicle acting nervously and
requested K9 "Loki,” a trained drug sniffing K-9 officer, respond to the scene.
The K-9 alerted to the presence of narcotics after performing a "free-air
sniff.” Deputies observed a plastic baggie with a number of small blue pills as
well as bag containing a blue powder. Both men were placed under arrest and taken
to the Greenwood County Detention Center.
		
	Deputy Solicitor Yates Brown and Assistant Solicitor
Andre Nguyen handled the case for the state. Gary was represented by Jane
Merrill of the Greenwood County Bar.
		
	Solicitor Stumbo praised the work of his staff along with
investigators at the Greenwood County Sheriff’s Office, particularly K-9
"Loki,” Inv. Michael Mejia, Inv. Matthew Womack, Matthew Noblin, in securing
the conviction and lengthy prison sentence.
		
	"The K-9 officers in our partner law enforcement agencies
do not always get the credit they deserve, but they are a critical part of the
front-line work in the war against deadly drugs on our streets,” Solicitor
Stumbo said. "I am pleased to have another drug trafficker out of our community
for the foreseeable future, and will continue to work with our partners in law
enforcement to fight back against the wave of devastating and deadly narcotics
in South Carolina.”

arm of GGC last July, successfully steering the final phase of the $1.56
million ‘Journey of Discovery’ campaign that supported several innovative
technologies in research and diagnostic testing. 

“GGC has been so fortunate to have strong philanthropic
support throughout our history,” said Steve Skinner, MD, Director of GGC. “Bill
brings valuable expertise as we expand our reach and advance our mission to
serve families with compassion and expertise.” 

“I feel a deep sense of calling to the mission of GGC, and I
pledge to move the mission forward with purpose and joy," said Tiller.
"I look forward to working alongside GGC’s distinguished professionals, in
partnership with donors and investors, and in service to the many children and
families who look to GGC for comfort and care."

Ltd will almost double production of its newly launched the Etios sedan to prevent prospective buyers from opting for other models as the waiting period now stretches to as much as eight months. The Indian arm of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. will start a second production shift at its Bidadi plant in Karnataka to meet growing demand, deputy managing director Sandeep Singh said. "There is nothing much that we can do with the kind of demand the Etios has generated. It has taken us by surprise," said Singh. "From April onwards, we will start second shift production at our Bidadi plant." Launched in December last year, the Etios has a waiting period of six-eight months, according to the Bangalore-based firm. With the second shift starting April, the company hopes to reduce this to three-four months."Currently we produce at least 2,500 units a month, but the demand is of around 7,000 units. It is quite difficult to bridge that gap in a quick time," said Singh. Production will be raised to 4,500-5,000, he added. The Etios, priced at below '5 lakh in an aggressive bid to enter the mass market, received 3,077 bookings in two days after its launch. The company said it has bookings for about 18,000 Etios cars. The company's second India plant, which is located in Bidadi, and cost '3,200 crore, has an annual capacity of 70,000 vehicles. Production began at Bidadi in December last year. "A long waiting period for the Etios may compel buyers to move to rival brands. It will have to act fast," said Akshay Bhalla, managing director, Protiviti Consulting Pvt. Ltd. The car is pitched against other entry-level sedans such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's Dzire and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd's Logan. "We have our plans in place, which will yield results in the coming years," Singh said, without elaborating. "A lot of the focus will be on localization."                    </p>                    <p class="cus-section-133-more">                        <a class="d-inline-block text-decoration-none fs-5 text-dark lh-1 fst-italic" href="https://gwdtoday.com/toyota-kirloskar-motor-pvt-ltd-will-almost-double-production-of-its-newly-p208-1.htm">More</a>                    </p>                </div>            </div>                            <style>.DisplayFlag{display:none;}</style>                    </div><style>@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=PT+Sans:wght@700&display=swap");.cus-133-label {border-bottom: 4px solid #bdcde3;}.cus-133-label > span{position: relative;}.cus-133-label > span:before {background: #25add8;position: absolute;display: inline-block;content: "";width: 100%;height: 4px;bottom: -6px;}.cus-section-133-archivemore span:hover {color: #04a1d2 !important;border-color: #04a1d2 !important;}.cus-section-133-archivemore-active ~ .cus-section-133-archive {display: flex !important;}.cus-section-133-archivemore-active {display: none !important;}div[data-cus-src*="lib/images/blank.png"]::after {position: absolute;top: 50%;left: 50%;transform: translate(-50%,-50%);color: gray;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.5rem;width: 100%;text-align: center;padding: 0 1rem;}</style><script>/* Hide on homepage*/if(ReadSubmenu() == SParameters()) {  document.querySelector(".cus-section-133-container").classList.add("d-none");}/* SubMenu Title */document.title = "Homepage";/* Load More Button */if(document.getElementsByClassName('cus-section-133-load-more').length) {document.getElementsByClassName('cus-section-133-load-more')[0].addEventListener('click', function(){document.getElementsByClassName('cus-section-133-archivemore')[0].classList.add('cus-section-133-archivemore-active');});}/* Blank Image Text */var cus_domain = "https://gwdtoday.com/";if (cus_domain.split('/').length > 4) {cus_domain = cus_domain.split('://').pop().split('/').slice(1).join('/').split('/').shift();} else {cus_domain = cus_domain.split('://').pop().split('/').shift();}document.getElementsByClassName("cus-section-133-container")[0].insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<style>div[data-cus-src*='lib/images/blank.png']::after {content: '" + cus_domain + "';</style>");</script><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">start();</script></div></div>
