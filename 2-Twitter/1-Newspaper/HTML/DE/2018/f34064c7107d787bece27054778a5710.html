this is the time of year that you may begin to think more about the missing family member(s).\nSo if you too, are thinking of a loved one or loved ones and want to connect with others who may be feeling the same way, perhaps starting a podcast on grief and relief might be a great way to grieve and relive some of those emotions.  I wrote a blog post years ago, “The Gift of Grief”, which I reshare every year and no matter what, it is the most commented on post in December because so many people can relate, and it’s not just December, because I bet if I reposted it in June or October, it would probably get a similar response.\nWith a podcast you can connect with others who may be feeling the same way, even though their grief and relationship with their loved ones may be different than yours being able to connect with others may help during this time.\nSince we still can’t connect with one another face to face like we did pre-COVID, this is a great alternative.  Starting a blog or a podcast that gives others a platform in which to share and care is a great way to help others and a gift meant to be shared.\nIf you are ready to start a podcast, then send an email to me at info@ablakeenterprises.com to schedule your 30-Minute Complimentary Discovery Call or order a copy of the “Podcasting Your Purpose” Resource Guide on Amazon to get started today!","duration":1074669,"episodeId":"encai9","episodeImage":"https:\u002F\u002Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\u002Fanchor-generated-image-bank\u002Fproduction\u002Fpodcast_uploaded_episode400\u002F53290\u002F53290-1607110173965-a9c47f2042b75.jpg","shareLinkPath":"\u002Fdelawareblogger\u002Fepisodes\u002FPodcasting-Through-Your-Pain-Eps--234-encai9","shareLinkEmbedPath":"\u002Fdelawareblogger\u002Fembed\u002Fepisodes\u002FPodcasting-Through-Your-Pain-Eps--234-encai9","stationId":"e9e6e8","title":"Podcasting Through Your Pain Eps. #234","isMT":false,"spotifyUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fopen.spotify.com\u002Fepisode\u002F51XUuD2YlgJ1x411d2IjM6"},{"created":"2020-11-20T23:37:46.000Z","createdUnixTimestamp":1605915466,"isDeleted":false,"modified":"2020-11-20T23:44:48.000Z","publishOn":"2020-11-21T15:00:00.000Z","publishOnUnixTimestamp":1605970800,"hourOffset":5,"podcastEpisodeIsExplicit":false,"podcastEpisodeType":"full","podcastEpisodeUuid":"8e721219-4836-4394-952a-1a67e45498cd","podcastSeasonNumber":4,"description":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E“Self Care for Podcasters -

don’t pay nor charge guests!\nOnce you have chosen your guests and scheduled the interview, send them Guest Release form which you can create in Google Docs along with a release statement include questions such as:\n\n Preferred name\u002FPreferred title\u002FOrganization\u002FBio\u002FHeadshot\u002FTopics to talk about\u002FLinks to website and social media platform\n\nRecording remotely can be a challenge and nerve racking, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from interviewing guests on the go.  I am going to leave the link in the show notes to an article by Descript.com that provides information on How to Record a Podcast Remotely and Get it Right the First Time.\nI have a few tip sheets for podcasters and podcast guests, so send an email to info@ablakeenterprises.com and I’ll send you a copy and you can also register for the Podcasting Your Purpose Coaching Session!","duration":1074343,"episodeId":"ekh3m1","episodeImage":"https:\u002F\u002Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\u002Fanchor-generated-image-bank\u002Fproduction\u002Fpodcast_uploaded_episode400\u002F53290\u002F53290-1601675087249-3c665cab74b7b.jpg","shareLinkPath":"\u002Fdelawareblogger\u002Fepisodes\u002FPodcast-Guest-Request-Pointers-Eps--226-ekh3m1","shareLinkEmbedPath":"\u002Fdelawareblogger\u002Fembed\u002Fepisodes\u002FPodcast-Guest-Request-Pointers-Eps--226-ekh3m1","stationId":"e9e6e8","title":"Podcast Guest Request Pointers Eps. #226","spotifyUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fopen.spotify.com\u002Fepisode\u002F5mMHXhmhDzStrhwMRk3ENi"},{"created":"2020-09-25T21:11:09.000Z","createdUnixTimestamp":1601068269,"isDeleted":false,"modified":"2020-10-09T20:50:32.000Z","publishOn":"2020-09-26T14:00:00.000Z","publishOnUnixTimestamp":1601128800,"hourOffset":4,"podcastEpisodeIsExplicit":false,"podcastEpisodeType":"full","podcastEpisodeUuid":"96c4fccf-da60-4e2c-b664-407a7c1b2766","podcastSeasonNumber":4,"description":"\u003Cp\u003EEpisode #225 of the Delaware Blogger Podcast\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHow Long Should a Podcast Show Be?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you've decided to start a podcast -

and featured in search results.  Unfortunately, Google can’t search MP3 files (at least not yet) so you need to include important keywords that are said in your podcast to be somewhere on the internet where the Google bots can find them.  Remember to make them readable with at least 300 words.\n\n Show notes allows you share the links to other resources\n\n\nUse your show notes to direct listeners to any links that you may have mentioned in the episode including affiliate links, online courses, books and invite them to join your email list for newsletter and podcast updates.\n\n Show notes increase your authority\n\n\nThe more content you have online the more legitimate you’ll look online to the search engines and others when they are searching online.\n\n  Show notes can be viewed on all devices\n\n\nWhen sharing your episodes you want a link that’s going to work for everyone no matter what device they’re using, Android or Apple which is not the case with some podcasting platforms.\n\n  Show notes are a great reference tool for your audience\n\n\nIf you provide links or mention articles or just want to share your guest’s information,  you can include them in your  show notes.  Listeners won’t need to take notes or re-listen to portions of your podcast for links they may have missed.\nThere are many other important reasons for show notes and I invite you to share some of your own and when you are ready to start your own podcast, please send an email to info@ablakeenterprises.com to schedule your 30-Min Complimentary Discovery Call or to enroll in the 90-Min Mini Coaching Session which is a great investment of $97.\nFind and follow me on all my social media platforms using the hashtag #DelawareBlogger or my linktree id Delblogger

However, there’s nothing like meeting face-to-face. This gives loyal listeners the opportunity to meet you and gives you the opportunity to learn more about your listeners.\n Live shows can help monetize your podcast.\nBesides being able to meet your audience in person, live shows can generate money to support the production of your podcast. You can charge a nominal fee to cover overhead like event space. Ideally, remaining funds can go towards items such as equipment upgrades and monthly RSS feed fees.\n Live shows can promote shopping local.\nEvents such as Small Business Saturday (presented by American Express) and the resurgence of entrepreneurship have made it cool to support small businesses in our communities.

However, there’s nothing like meeting face-to-face. This gives loyal listeners the opportunity to meet you and gives you the opportunity to learn more about your listeners.\n Live shows can help monetize your podcast.\nBesides being able to meet your audience in person, live shows can generate money to support the production of your podcast. You can charge a nominal fee to cover overhead like event space. Ideally, remaining funds can go towards items such as equipment upgrades and monthly RSS feed fees.\n Live shows can promote shopping local.\nEvents such as Small Business Saturday (presented by American Express) and the resurgence of entrepreneurship have made it cool to support small businesses in our communities.

<p><strong>This has been such a frequently asked question, that I decided to address it again in this episode of the Delaware Blogger Podcast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once you have decided to start a podcast; you’ve chosen a title, topic and your description and you may even have your equipment and are ready to get into the closets to start recording.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, one of the biggest questions you may have before hitting the record button is, “how long should my podcast episode be?”  How long should I be talking….5 mins...15 mins...30 minutes or even 60 minutes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre-COVID, when podcasting was becoming popular I was taught that it was best to record no more than 28-35 minutes which was a normal commute on a bus, train or in a car, however, now with most people working remotely that has changed...a normal commute is about 13 stairs!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people’s commute is from the bedroom to the living room so the attention span got longer which is a good thing because we had so much more time on our hands with nothing to do, vegging out on Netflix became popular so much so that “Netflix and Chill” became a popular phrase.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will be presenting “Creating a Binge Listening Podcast”</strong> at the PodKnow2021 Online Podcasting Conference on June 24th, here is the <a href="https://nycpodcastnetwork.com/conference-speaker/antionette-blake/?1615675517" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">link</a> if you need tickets https://nycpodcastnetwork.com/conference-speaker/antionette-blake/?1615675517</p>
<p>Just like blogging, if you can say it in 50 words, why write 500 words?</p>
<p>Listen to the entire episode to determine how long your show will be - but remember, you have to “do you boo boo!”</p>

<p>Whether or not you are a newbie or a veteran podcaster, promotion is by far the biggest pain point for most hosts.  With over 60 social media platforms to choose from there’s no doubt that your ideal audience is out there, ready to engage with you and your content.  But how do you promote on social media effectively? The first step is understanding where your audience hangs out and then be there consistently with good content to actively grow that audience.</p>
<p><strong>The number don’t lie!</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Facebook</strong> has 2.8 billion monthly active users<br />
</li>
 <li><strong>Instagram</strong> has 1 billion monthly active users<br />
</li>
 <li><strong>Twitter</strong> has 353 million monthly active users<br />
</li>
 <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> has 310 million monthly active users</li>
</ul>
<p>However, not all social media platforms are created equal! While you may want to have a presence on all of the main channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube), it’s best to start slow. You can always expand in the future.  Focus on who your ideal listener may be, as well as the subject matter covered in your show – where do those types of people congregate online? Do they engage with Facebook groups? Are they on Twitter? Are they on Instagram? YouTube?</p>
<p>Use audience data and analytics to pick the platform that best matches your listener and spend your initial efforts where you can make the largest impact on your target audience and here are a few quick tips:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Set up a business webpage or website - Podpage or Wordpress</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create one link to make it easier to share</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Create videos and add captions to catch and keep attention</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Send weekly emails or monthly newsletters - preferably Sunday mornings at 7 AM - early riser/reader</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Use audio grams/headliners/audiobursts for teasers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Always create a CTA</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now it doesn’t matter whether you are an entrepreneur, solopreneur, freelancer, a 9-5 employee or even a SAHM/SAHM, you may have thought about starting a podcast. Perhaps you have a passion or a hobby that you wish to share with others, are considered an expert or guru in your field, then starting a podcast to share that knowledge and expertise is a great way in which to do so.</p>
<p>You might also think that it is going to be an expensive investment and that you will need to spend a lot of money for equipment, hardware and software. But nope, that is not the case and you can start a podcast and get it up and running without having to spend a lot of money.</p>
<p>Remember, "<em><strong>you don't have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great"</strong></em> - Les Brown</p>

<p>First impressions are important so you want to have a simple, yet eye-catching design that works as well at the size of a postage stamp as well as on a large desktop screen.</p>
<p>Also, please note that you need cover art in order to submit your podcast to the major directories and there’s no way around that.</p>
<p>Think of your cover art as your favorite album cover and to those of us who remember when we purchased an album from the record shop sometimes it was just for the cover so that we can hang it on the walls, but I digress and I am also showing my age!</p>
<p>However, no matter what topic or niche of your podcast, there are many others, literally millions of other shows to compete against, so you want your art to be unique and draw attention immediately - we have the attention span that is less of a goldfish!</p>
<p>So when people are scrolling through podcasts they are seeing different colors, shapes and fonts and you want to make yours different so it catches their attention making them want to stop, click and listen!</p>

<p><strong>When you have decided to start a podcast for your business, remember, it should be an extension of your brand, not a replacement of your brand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Concept/Topic</strong></p>
<p>When starting a podcast for your business you should always start with a concept, topic or niche.  What is your podcast going to be about?  Will it be about the product and services that you offer or will it be a topic that is related to your offerings for your target market audience and/or help to solve their pain points.</p>
<p>Allow your creativity and personality to shine through.  Make sure if you have guests that they too are good for your business brand - remember, <strong>“your brand is your bond and your bond is your brand!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tone of the Show</strong></p>
<p>What is the tone of your show, will it be professional and serious or will it be light hearted and fun.  Whichever tone it takes, make sure that it presents your business in a positive light - “shine online” and the guests you choose should also fit the tone of your show.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Content</strong></p>
<p>Your podcast should provide to your listeners content that is of value and you shouldn’t use your show as an advertisement.  The podcast is about your audience not your ego so use it to improve your relationship with your clients, customers and listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>What is going to motivate you to start a podcast?  Yes, it can be about making money, but that should not be the main reason to start.  You want to grow your audience, drive traffic to your blog, website or brick and mortar store.  You want people to know, like and trust you so that you can increase your bottom line.</p>
<p>Listen to the entire episode to get the summary of the 5 reasons to start a podcast for your business and how to schedule your Complimentary Discovery Call to get started.</p>

She has started a women&#x27;s group, &quot;Embrace Your Inner Light&quot; and helps to run the family business, &quot;Helping One More Entrepreneur&quot; where Blake&#x27;s Booth Podcasting Studio is located, 108 Patriot Drive, Suite A in Middletown, DE.<br/> I wanted to sit and chat with Rosemarie to test out the equipment and everything about this interview went quick smoothly.

<p>However, listeners are not too keen on paying for a podcast or even<strong> buying a cup of coffee</strong> or <strong>donating</strong> to your show.  As there are over 1 million published podcast shows, listeners feel that they should be free like public radio.</p>
<p><strong>Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>That is what we will be discussing today on the Delaware Blogger Podcast</p>
<p><strong>Music/Transition provided by thePodcastHost.com &amp; Alitu: The Podcast Maker</strong></p>
<p>According to a recent article in Variety, “MOST PODCAST LISTENERS STILL LUKEWARM ON PAYING FOR PODCASTS, DATA SUGGESTS.  There certainly has been a subscription revenue boom in the media space in recent years, but it may not have benefited podcasts as much as other forms of media."</p>

<p>My podcast music was provided by <strong>The Podcast Host and Alitu</strong> @thepodcasthost.com/freemusic</p>
<p>Today, I want to touch on a few tips on how to use your words to change the world with your podcast, as I have always stated in my Podcasting Your Purpose presentations and coaching sessions, that you can literally change someone’s life with your voice.</p>
<ul>
 <li>H2H engagement and make it conversational; 1 to 1<br />
</li>
 <li>Be genuine in your emotions - use the mirror trick if necessary because what you see on the outside will shine from the inside<br />
</li>
  <li>Powerful Yet Passionate<br />
</li>
  <li>Climate Conditions - where are you, how are you feeling?<br />
</li>
  <li>Visualization - speak with enthusiasm<br />
</li>
  <li>Meaningful stories on a particular subject matter<br />
</li>
  <li>Who / Where / What - give details if necessary - CTA<br />
</li>
  <li>Relevant / Authentic / Genuine - not a condescending, know it all attitude<br />
</li>
  <li>TMI - no information overload - do not pack a lot of data - re-purpose or create a series<br />
</li>
  <li>Touches emotionally<br />
</li>
  <li>Guidance - helping hand<br />
</li>
  <li>Clarity - speak with a clear voice and eliminate any distracting background noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be engaged in the beginning with a catchy episode title and be straight to the point about your topic.<br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be conversational with your personality not someone else's voice.<br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be consistent in rituals including the same greeting which should be  short and simple and solidifies the brand - sense of comfort.<br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Show should include a clear beginning/intro, topic of interest and promise of value, CTA and outro<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Podcasting is still a marketing tool, not only for your business but for your brand as well, so these are just a few things that can turn your podcasting journey into one that is not only rewarding to yourself, but to others as well.</p>
<p>As I stated in last week’s show, “Creating a Binge Listening Podcast” this can be the catalyst that makes someone want to binge listen to all of your episodes.</p>
<p>So if there is anything that you heard in this episode that you wish to share or has helped you, please feel free to do so and leave a review so that others can get this information as well.</p>

<p>Podcast creation is becoming very popular and it’s HOT - but so is listening to podcasts too!  People are boasting about and promoting on their social media platforms about how they are bingeing on podcasts.  Podcasting bingeing is actually better than "Chillaxin with Netflix", sitting on a sofa with ice cream and consuming content when they have time.</p>
<p>Unlike sitting and bingeing on Netflix, people can listen to podcasts on the go...listening anywhere...at any time and to the podcast episodes that they want.</p>
<p>“Bingeing” on entertainment became popular in 2007 when both Netflix and DVRs were introduced which allowed television viewers to spend entire weekends catching up and watching full seasons of shows, instead of waiting one week or more in between new episodes. That same method of consuming entertainment is now becoming a natural way in which to listen to podcasts too!</p>
<p>The pandemic also sped up the popularity to consuming more digital programming literally overnight. Everywhere in the world people are spending more time using digital and artificial devices.</p>
<p>But what makes a podcast binge worthy, that’s what I talked about in this episode of the Delaware Blogger podcast and basically there are only 3 elements and they are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Subject Matter<br />
</li>
 <li>StoryTelling Skills<br />
</li>
  <li>Length and Frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>Podcasts are quickly becoming the number one platform for telling and sharing interesting stories with the world. Got a story to share? Why not consider starting a podcast to get your message out there?</p>

<p><strong>CTA's are vital, they tell listeners what to do next or how to connect to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A call-to-action, or CTA, is a marketing term referring to a piece of content, such as an image, a button or a line of text, intended to prompt users to perform a specific action.</strong></p>
<strong>Why is a CTA important?</strong>
<p>Strategic calls-to-action (CTAs) can help you guide your visitors through the buying journey and directly impact your <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/conversion-rate" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversion rates</a>. A really effective CTA will draw visitors’ attention, piquing their interest and guide them to the next step which should be the signup process -- email addresses are gol!</p>
<p>Conversion is simply getting someone to respond to some kind of a call to action. A successful CTA results in a conversion. Most of the time, it involves a click or tap on a button.</p>
<p>Human's minds are so accustomed to being told what to do or given instructions that we naturally expect it especially in the online world; they are oftentimes looking for a call-to-action whether is a button or just a command.   That, however, doesn’t mean they’re prepared to follow your instruction and convert and oftentimes it takes several times before they even take action so after the break I will give you some samples of CTAs that you can use and can be mastered if you follow the proven techniques.</p>
<p>A CTA is typically an instruction or directive using action verbs like “buy”, “sign up”, “register”, “follow”, etc. and they lead the consumer to the next step of your sales funnel or process.</p>
<p>Calls to action are most commonly used in sales and marketing to solicit the desired action from leads and customers. For example, a CTA can be used to grow your email list (“Sign up to our newsletter”), promote a special offer (“Claim your voucher code”) or a piece of content (“Download our new eBook”).</p>

<p>Podcasts are great when you want to earn a little extra income, but it also requires a little extra work. If you put in the time to find quality sponsors, instead of just any sponsor, you’ll enjoy the rewards of satisfied listeners and put a little extra cash in your pocket.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways to make money with your show which includes asking for donations; creating a membership site; Patreon; selling merchandise, or work-for-hire on other podcasts and radio shows.</p>
<p>In this episode I explained the 2 types of podcast ads:</p>

 <li><strong>Host Read</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Radio Style</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Sponsorships are a great way to <strong>monetize</strong> your podcast by getting paid to promote a product, brand or service.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, nearly two-thirds of podcast listeners act based on ads they heard, whether they make a purchase or simply search for information based on the recommendation.</p>
<p>So, when the time comes and you are ready to seek out sponsors for your podcast shows, there are a just a few steps that you need to take.</p>
<p>The first step should always be to <strong>consider your niche and your audience</strong>. The most important part of <strong>sponsorship </strong>is finding <strong>sponsors </strong>that fit your niche or topic and/or solve a pain point for your listeners.</p>

<p><strong>Grant it, we don’t all have the “perfect” radio or podcasting voice and many of us will admit to “hating the sound of our voice” but you have to remember, that to some your voice may be perfect and to others not so much.  As a matter of fact I was watching an episode of the Odd Couple and Felix was trying to help Mirna, Oscar’s secretary change her nasely voice - what he didn’t realize, her boyfriend loved her voice and everyone in her family sounded the same way - so where you might feel that you have a nasally voice - someone else may love it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now unless you are a professional DJ or voiceover artist, you don’t need to enunciate everything perfectly you want to be conversational and casual more like a friend unless your podcast is a narrated documentary then that’s a different story and I won’t be talking about that on today’s show.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you are speaking try to do so as clearly as possible especially if you have a thick accent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Experiment  – record, listen, modify</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t Fake the Funk - communicate emotions and feelings</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Stand while you are recording</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Practice breathing</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Review the script</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Slow down and take a pause</strong></p>

<p>Are you drinking the juice?  No, not the apple juice, lemonade, water or wine sitting in a glass next to you when you need to wet your whistle...I am talking about Google Juice - are you drinking the juice?</p>
<p>This is by far the easiest way to ensure that your content gets a much wider and broader audience. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the bridge between your podcast content and your audience’s ears.</p>
What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?
<p>Search Engine Optimization helps the search engines get your content to listeners, whether they are using Google, Bing, Yahoo or Yelp. It increases the quality and quantity of listeners through organic search engine results. Organic as it FREE - not talking about paid ads here.  SEO helps attract visitors who are truly interested in the content that your podcast provides and it increases the traffic to them that are specifically looking for your content.</p>
<p>On today's episode of the Delaware Blogger Podcast I am sharing 4 ways in which to improve your SEO</p>
Now with full disclosure, these are just 4 ways in which to improve your SEO and they are not all inclusive, but they definitely are great ways to start so if you haven’t done anything to increase the listening audience or download numbers then they will help.  Today’s episode is being sponsored by H.O.M.E. - Helping One More Entrepreneur in Middletown, DE www.thehomellc.com

While it's not 100% necessary, having a website can do a lot for you as far as promoting and finding your podcast through the search engines - or SEO.</p>
<p>I’ve been blogging since 2012 and yes, it takes time to build and grow an audience and increase readership and no it’s not easy, but you can do it and if you are looking for a place to begin, start by signing up with Podpage and please feel free to use my referral link : https://www.podpage.com/?via=antionette</p>
<p>The purpose of a blog or website is to house all your episodes in one location. Most podcasters post their shows on various social media platforms which is fine, but it’s much easier for your listeners to go to one site and you can also track your analytics from the one site as well.</p>
<p><strong>Find the right Platform</strong></p>
<p>If you want to build a blog or website from scratch, then I suggest GoDaddy because there are plenty of different templates so you can choose the look you want.</p>
<p>I can teach you <a href="//www.ablakeenterprises.com" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how to start a blog</a> as part of my offerings for $299 or you can wait and enroll in my online <strong>Build a Blog</strong> course which is coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>Podcast Posts</strong></p>
<p>Use your show notes to create short blog posts about each episode. The content should include specific keywords for search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
<p>SEO is the way in which search engines rank certain websites. If you want your show's website to show up on the first page of Google, consider adding high ranking keywords to your blog posts. If you need more assistance in researching keywords, try using Google's<a href="https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> keyword planner</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the show notes from your podcast episodes you should also include other key elements such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>About The Host(s): Let your audience get t know you and the others if there are more than one<br />
</li>
 <li>What to Expect: Why you started the show and what your audience can expect from it<br />
</li>
  <li>Events: Showcase when you’re hosting  an event<br />
</li>
  <li>CTA: What do you want them to do or where to go after reading the post<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/delblogger" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Post Promotion</strong></a></p>
<p>The best part of having a blog or website is in promoting it via the various channels. Especially if your goal is to have listeners find your episodes all in one site, you need to make sure that you're directing them to that site.</p>
<p>Make sure you add your URL to your social media bios or create a Linktree id which makes it easier to find. Your end of show CTA should let your listeners know where they can find you and ask them to leave comments on your posts because comments and reviews can also boost your SEO rankings.</p>

<p>Podcasting listenership is increasing every day with more than 90M people in American alone reporting they listen to a podcast show each and every month.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID19-Pandemic, not only are people listening more from home using their Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets and Desktops they are listening via Smart Speakers; AI Devices and via Infotainment Centers built into their vehicles.</p>
<p>Listening to music is still high, but the news, talk and sports listening is increasing especially those with podcasts covering these topics.  Consumers are consuming more media so business owners and brands need to create more content to satisfy this increase.</p>
<p>Technology is at our fingertips and there is no longer a distinction  between age groups or other demographics either, with many saying “goodbye” to green screens shooting videos to saying “hello” to their walk-in closets recording podcasts.</p>
<p>So if you are a business owner, entrepreneur, solopreneur or even a side hustler, you should start a podcast so that you can broaden your brand and expand your exposure online.</p>

<p><strong>Go for the Goal</strong></p>
<p>You need to be clear on why you want to make a Podcast. What is the goal of your podcast, Think about whether you need a Podcast for your main life (brand) or business objectives.   Health, fitness, family, finances, retirement, education, college, vocational training, new business start up…and you need to know the pain points of your target market audience.</p>
<strong>Caring is Sharing</strong>
<p>Choose an idea for a podcast that you are genuinely interested or passionate about.  You don’t need to be an expert in this field right now, but you need to be interested enough to spend the next few years learning more about a topic and creating content on this topic. So choose wisely.  Passion will keep you motivated in moments of a slowdown.</p>
<p>Note: There are more than <strong>1 million Podcasts, but over 650 million blogs. </strong>There may be less competition in podcasting, but you must consistently create high-quality content, otherwise you won’t get noticed and if you are not posting new content <strong>regularly</strong>, you will lose your <strong>relevance</strong>.</p>
<strong>Future Monetization for Your Podcast</strong>
<p>With the rising popularity of podcasts there is an opportunity to make money online. If you are planning to work hard on your podcasts, so think about a <strong>monetization </strong>strategy in advance which includes: <strong>Affiliate marketing / Patreon / Selling your product</strong></p>
<strong>What Problem Will Your Podcast Solve?</strong>
<p>You must know your audience well. Are they male or female? What do they do? Are they college students, working professionals, or senior citizens? Are they single moms, bloggers, or entrepreneurs? Know the demographics of podcast listeners.  Knowing this will help you choose a topic for a podcast that will talk about something that is a specific pain-point solution for people. Use your podcast to give answers to your audience’s questions.</p>
<strong>Select a Niche and a Format for Your Podcast</strong>
<p>Even if you are creating podcasts as a hobby or a business,  it is not advisable to talk about too many different types of topics, for example, don’t talk about weight loss in one episode and then politics in the next.  Try to have a theme or be  specific with your genre or issues so that your audience is likely to come back for more. If you want to make Podcasts to spread awareness, choose a theme instead of working on a bunch of random topics every week.</p>
<p>Along with a niche, you should also choose a format. A Podcast is an audio media where you can experiment with several formats; it can be scripted with a solo host or an interview between two individuals, or even a free-flowing conversation within a small group of people.</p>
<p><strong>Include Keywords for SEO</strong></p>
<p>Your podcast will rank higher in search if the topics include keywords that users commonly search. Search Engine Optimization Strategies so that people find your podcast through search engines like Google. There are many tools where you can <a href="https://www.authoritylabs.com/validate-podcast-keyword-research/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">find highly searched keywords</a> on your subject and use it in your topic. Try to have the main keyword for your podcast episode in the title or description.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is the tone of your show<br />
</strong>If you are not creating a podcast as an extension of your brand, business or blog, you will need to think about the tone of the show.</p>
<p>For example, will it be professional, personal, funny, educating, enlightening, inspirational, motivational?</p>
<p>Whatever it is, choose a podcast name that reflects the tone of the show.   If it’s going to be funny or humorous, then try incorporating something witty - write down words that are associated with the mood.</p>
<p>Try using <a href="https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNTY3NjkyOCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiaWlidXo2bGp0Ym9memhxbzJiaWsiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JlbGF0ZWR3b3Jkcy5vcmcvP19fcz1oMmltd3hzczhndWZ0Y2kxeHlmOSJ9" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relatedwords.org</a> to search for words that match the feel of your podcast!</p>
<p><strong>2. Make your name short and sweet!</strong></p>
<p>Good podcast names are always short, catchy, and easy to remember.   No matter how you choose to name a podcast, you want to make it easy for your target audience to find you.</p>
<p><strong>A good rule of thumb here is to cap it at 3-4 syllables tops! </strong>Anything longer than that may make it difficult for your audience to remember -  a shorter name is better in general.</p>
<p><strong>3. Research your competition</strong></p>
<p>Check out the names of other podcasts in the same niche, it is a great way to gauge podcast names from others in the industry. The goal is to quickly have listeners identify your niche within the first couple of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make sure your name isn’t already taken</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a no brainer, right?  Well you never know, make sure to do a Google Search and this also includes profile and business pages on other social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>You don’t want to make the mistake of registering an available domain - but then realizing later on that someone else has already used the same one on social media!</p>
<p>It takes only a few minutes to go through each platform to see if your podcast’s name or a variation of it has already been taken by other people.</p>

<p>It begins with Halloween - the dark and spooky holiday that actually sets the tone for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa then New Years, especially if you are suffering mental or physical disorders.</p>
<p>Now, before I begin, let me make this disclaimer, I am not nor have I ever been a member of the medical community therefore, nothing I say today is recommended to go against your personal physician's recommendations and or prescribed medications.</p>
<p>I do know that as a blogger, someone who loves to write and a podcaster, someone who loves to talk, both of these activities have helped me navigate my pain - especially as a podcaster.</p>
<p>As a podcast host, one who has interviewed others, it afforded me an opportunity to connect with new people, locally as well as across the pond.  As a podcast guest, it has given me a chance to share with others and both of these opportunities has helped to take the focus off my problems both mentally and physically especially as a Type 2 Diabetic.</p>
<p>Not that being a diabetic is a death sentence, because it is not, however, it has altered my life a bit and it can be frustrating to say the least, however, there are bigger concerns especially during this time, with the loss of loved ones whether it was this year, 11 years ago with the death of my grandmother or 28 years ago, when I lost my sister - this is the time of year that you may begin to think more about the missing family member(s).</p>
<p>So if you too, are thinking of a loved one or loved ones and want to connect with others who may be feeling the same way, perhaps starting a podcast on grief and relief might be a great way to grieve and relive some of those emotions.  I wrote a blog post years ago,<a href="https://delblogger.com/the-gift-of-grief-coping-with-death-during-the-holidays/" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong> “The Gift of Grief”</strong></a>, which I reshare every year and no matter what, it is the most commented on post in December because so many people can relate, and it’s not just December, because I bet if I reposted it in June or October, it would probably get a similar response.</p>
<p>With a podcast you can connect with others who may be feeling the same way, even though their grief and relationship with their loved ones may be different than yours being able to connect with others may help during this time.</p>
<p>Since we still can’t connect with one another face to face like we did pre-COVID, this is a great alternative.  Starting a blog or a podcast that gives others a platform in which to share and care is a great way to help others and a gift meant to be shared.</p>

<p><strong>November 4th was NATIONAL STRESS AWARENESS DAY and although self care has become quite the buzzword unfortunately, many of us have not done a good job in taking care of ourselves in the way we should.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In today’s world filled with anger, anxiety and angst as well as the remote working, remote education and the COVID19 pandemic many of us are neglecting our self care which could be negatively impacting our health and well-being - cutting our lives short.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes, our lives are stressful; we have jobs to do, responsibilities to fulfill, and people who depend on us, and now more than ever, we’re facing uncertainties that put us under strain, and as podcasters, there’s also the added pressure to continually create valuable content, to put out high-quality episodes, promote and market your show, and connect with your audience. It can be a lot!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today’s episode of Podcasting Your Purpose, I am sharing a few self-care tips that will hopefully help you and (your podcast) feel great and help you to function at your best level, so you can feel good both mentally and physically.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you feel good, you’ll share good energy, and you and your podcast will benefit from it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this episode of the Delaware Blogger Podcast, I give you 6 self care tips to keep your mind, body and soul healthy and happy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I remember having a reading circle in my classroom when I taught 3rd grade and it was the best part of the day.  Having all the kids sit in a circle while I read to them some would lay back and close their eyes while I read - they were probably imaging the scenes and characters in the book not aware that I was showing the pictures after each paragraph.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I loved reading to my sons when they were young, making the voices of the Disney Characters like Mickey Mouse or Pluto, this too was the best time of the day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do you think LeVar Burton’s Reading Rainbow was so popular?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most people love listening to stories and that is why storytelling sells a podcast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have to be relatable to your listeners, you have to offer them something - education, entertainment, enlightenment, inspiration, motivation - something, but more importantly, you have to tell the story in order to sell them to come back for more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, not everyone is a good storyteller, nor is everyone a good podcaster, but if you are good at telling stories, not LIES, then you probably are a good podcaster.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I have however, authored 2 books,</strong><a href="https://app.thebookpatch.com/BookStore/basic-blogging-tips-for-beginners/630a64d2-75eb-42e7-a089-ccbc68e8dccd?isbn=9781645507574" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong> “Basic Blogging Tips for Beginners”</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3exl0tM" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>“Podcasting Your Purpose” </strong></a><strong>Resource Guide on Amazon and just recently completed another Podcasting eBook which I will be launching during the holidays.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These books are an extension of the podcast and blog that allows yet another opportunity to expand and broaden my brand online.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are many podcasters out there who have expanded their influence and reach by taking topics shared via audio on their podcast then putting those words on paper and turning it into a book and so should you!</strong></p>

<p>I will also be presenting “Podcasting For Your Business or Brand” on November 12th from 6:30 to 8:00 pm in Middletown, so this is perfect timing for me.  </p>
<p>During that in-person and virtual session, I will be covering a lot of information, such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What is a podcast<br />
</li>
 <li>Why start a business podcast<br />
</li>
  <li>Power of podcasting<br />
</li>
  <li>Planning a podcast<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about the benefits of starting a business podcast and if you are following me along, you know that not only does a podcast connect you to your clients and customer base in a non-salesy manner, but it can also help to broaden your brand and expand your exposure online and even perhaps provide an additional stream of income.</p>
<p>Podcasting is becoming a very popular and powerful medium and there are so many exciting enhancements coming to the podcasting world including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sharing your podcast on Instagram Reels<br />
</li>
  <li>1-click submit to all podcast directories if you are not on Anchor, Transistor.fm now offers this service<br />
</li>
  <li>Spotify who owns anchor has reported it <a href="https://go.podnews.net/l/VIsU763setpkZzycjIOAfqJQ/Dcd7U9A2lnR8UCFjV6rB9g/nVn3kMus763SK892CqS646763YiA" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has 320m monthly active users</a>: which up 29% year-on-year. 22% of them used podcasts (up 1% from last quarter).<br />
</li>
  <li><a href="https://go.podnews.net/l/VIsU763setpkZzycjIOAfqJQ/JF5ICg37rD47BcF9ktOs763g/nVn3kMus763SK892CqS646763YiA" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon’s net income tripled year-on-year</a>.<br />
</li>
  <li>Oh and Netflix, which by the way is increasing their monthly costs, will soon be offering audio-only mode for background listening which will basically allow you to listen to your Netflix shows like you would listen to podcasts, allowing you to attend to other important tasks, which require your complete attention.</li>
  <li><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>So this is the perfect time to start a podcast and starting on November 1st, you can join millions of other podcasters as we kick of NaPodPoMo!<br />

<p>Did you know that you can get more guests from LinkedIn for your podcast than from Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>Did you know that you should be promoting your podcast on LinkedIn more than on Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>The answer to these questions should be YES YES &amp; YES!</p>
<p>If you are a podcaster and are doing this professionally, yes, like turning a hobby into a jobby, one of the best ways in which to promote yourself is on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>With all the changes with the Facebook algorithms, and the constant trash talking on Twitter, you may want to spend more time on LinkedIn, with not only promoting your podcast, but also in making connects for guests and sponsors as well as speaking engagements and paid gigs.</p>
<p>If your podcast is designed to help others in their industries, then you need to include that in your profile summary.</p>
<p>For example when you land on my LinkedIn profile, under my picture are the keywords:</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Manager📌Author📌Award-winning Blogger 📌TV/Podcast Host 📌Professional Speaker📌Branding Specialist 📌</strong></p>
<p>So right away you know that I am a Podcast Host.  My articles not only include my blog posts about podcasting, but also the links to the show for listening.</p>
<p>My About Me clearly reads: <strong>As a Professional Speaker, Coach, and Adjunct Instructor I train others on how to start a blog and or a podcast. As the CEO of A. Blake Enterprises I help business owners with their social media marketing &amp; branding strategies to effectively engage with their target market audience.... see more</strong></p>
<p>Featured Media includes the cover art for both of my podcasts,<a href="https://tinyurl.com/blog2profit" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong> “Blog Your Way to a Business Profit”</strong></a> and the “Delaware Blogger Podcast” with clickable links to the show directories.</p>
<p>My Experience also includes<strong> “podcast host”</strong></p>
<p>So you can plainly see that I am promoting myself as a podcast host and when I post, I also use the appropriate hashtags, #podcast #podcaster #podcasthost #podcastlife #delawarepodcaster</p>
<p>This is definitely a much better way in which to not only promote your podcast, but to also see guests for your show which is how I found most of mine for the “Out and About with Antionette” and”Social Media Sunday with the Delaware Blogger” podcasts.  I still get offers for guests via LinkedIn and outside of Facebook groups and communities that is the only means of contact I have made for guests.</p>
<p>Think of Linkedin as your 24/7 365 Chamber of Commerce where you can reach out to others who may be a great fit for your podcast and are professionals in what they do, as you can check from their profiles, which is far more extensive than a Facebook or Twitter bio.</p>
<p>So in your profile, make sure to make clear what your podcast is about so that others using search words will find you and include those key words in your profile and you may even want to include a profile pic that contains a mic - however, a professional picture with your face is more trustworthy than an image of a microphone.</p>

<p><strong>If you have yet to subscribe or Favorite my channel,  I invite you to do so now because every week I provide podcasting pointers that will help you launch and grow your podcast and if you prefer to see my face in the place with these pointers, head over to YouTube and subscribe - using my name Antionette Blake</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today’s topic “Podcasting in Your Prime - This is Your Time” Most of you that have been following me and my blog, Delblogger knows that my tagline is “Boomer Who Blogs with a Millenial Mind” and that my target market audience and clients are usually boomers and beyond, you know, those of us born between 1946 and 1964, personally it was 1961 for me and last month, on September 20th to be exact, I celebrated my 59th Birthday and just the month before on August 11th, I celebrated 30 years of marriage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some of you may say, “wow” that’s a long time, or “gurl you are old” - but I respond with “age ain’t nothin but a number - now ask me about my podcasts”</strong></p>
<p><strong>With age comes wisdom and common sense, yes, we went to school, many to HBCU’s or institutes of higher learning, but nothing I learned in college back in the late 70’s and 80’s prepared me for what’s going on in the world now - but that’s a different story for a different day!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anywho, with age comes wisdom and knowledge that we can share with others which is why I encourage women AND men of a particular age to think about or actually to start a podcast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We can share not only life skills but corporate skills, job skills, family skills, educational skills, technology skills, speaking skills, musical skills, storytelling skills, I could go on and on, but you know where I am going.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once you get to a certain point in life, there is knowledge and wisdom to share and doing so on a podcast is probably the best platform today.  You can command the attention of 100’s, 1000’s, even perhaps millions of people using your own voice and you can do it from the comfort of your home in a t-shirt and shorts like me!</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I hope I have motivated a few of you boomers and beyond to take the next step to start a podcast and I hope those that I spoke with last week will definitely pursue their passion because age is just a number and we should be podcasting in our prime time which is now!</strong></p>
<p><strong>So if you are ready to share your skills with the world, using your voice, please send an email to </strong><a href="mailto:info@ablakeenterprises.com" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>info@ablakeenterprises.com</strong></a><strong> to register for the 2-hour Podcasting Your Purpose Coaching Session and you will receive a Resource Guide, printables and other great items to get you started and launched and even learn how to monetize your podcast.</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, when you are looking for guests, make sure they fit the niche of the show and are providing value to your listeners.  You don’t just want to bring on a guest just because they are “rich and famous” unless their last name is Obama or Winfrey - just kidding.  Hey, you might even get James Carville on your show if it’s political because he too is launching a podcast - we are stompin' with the big dogs now.</p>
<p>Anywho, if you are interviewing guests, make sure to lay the ground rules and don’t let them take over your show because once you lose control you might be able to bring them back.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, even if you’ve known your guest for a period of time or have heard them interviewed on another podcast, they might try to hijack your show and that definitely is a no no.</p>
<p>My previous podcasts “Out and About with Antionette” were scripted interview style shows, I alway sent the Q&amp;A’s to my guest prior to the show along with a guest release, however, it was always notated that even with the scripted Q&amp;A’s there would be some ad-libbing, because you to make sure that you are delivering what you have promised your listeners no matter what and you do want to allow for some good storytelling to keep everyone engaged.</p>
<p>Finding podcast guests can be a struggle at first, but podcasting is still considered to be a new medium and a lot of people would be excited to be guests on your show.</p>
<p>So when you put out a call to find your guests, whether you are searching on LinkedIn using the appropriate hashtags or asking memes in your Facebook and Twitter podcast communities, be sure you let people know the type of show that you have as well as the topics of which you are seeking so you both know the criteria before you book them onto your show.</p>
<p><strong>Remember,</strong> you don’t have to put anything or anyone on it that you don’t want to and 2  no-no’s - don’t pay nor charge guests!</p>
<p>Once you have chosen your guests and scheduled the interview, send them<strong> Guest Release form</strong> which you can create in Google Docs along with a release statement include questions such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Preferred name/Preferred title/Organization/Bio/Headshot/Topics to talk about/Links to website and social media platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Recording remotely can be a challenge and nerve racking, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from interviewing guests on the go.  I am going to leave the link in the show notes to an article by Descript.com that provides information on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-lpnUxNYhHpUqF7vopVViuvy8g9Pnrr8EEpr2IVVOEs/edit" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Record a Podcast Remotely and Get it Right the First Time.</a></p>

<p>How Long Should a Podcast Show Be?</p>
<p>So you've decided to start a podcast - yay and congratulations! You have your title, your topic and your description.  You may even have purchased some equipment and are ready to get into the closet to start recording.</p>
<p>However, before hitting the record button you may be wondering just how long to record - 5 mins...15 mins...30 minutes or even 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Back in the day….long long time ago, when podcasting was first becoming popular with everyday folk, we were taught that it was best to hit it and quit it - don’t make it too long or people wouldn’t have time to listen as most were doing so via a normal commute which was 28-35 minutes - not in NYC or DMV, however, just long enough to get people from their home to their place of business...now with remote working, thanks to COVID-19 that changed.</p>
<p>Most people’s commute was from the bedroom to the living room so the attention span got longer which is a good thing because we had so much more time on our hands with nothing to do, vegging out on Netflix became popular so much so that “Netflix and Chill” became a popular phrase.</p>
<p>Podcast lengths began to change as well, however, it was intimidating for many that had short 30 minute shows to increase them to 60 minutes plus which is why, your content and your audience will determine when to “hit it and quit” it.</p>

<p>In today's episode of the Delaware Blogger Podcast I am once again talking about Podcasting in the Classroom as I did in Episode #201 back in March.  With remote learning and Zoom Bombing, podcasting may be a great way to get and keep the students engaged in or outside of the  classroom.</p>
<p>As much as we want to think that kids want to stare at a computer screen all day everyday, that may not be the case and it can cause harm to their eyes, however, with a podcast, they can pop in their earbuds or put on their headphones every time a new episode of their favorite pod is released, head outdoors, walk the dog, eat lunch or just veg on the sofa after a long day of mathematics.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, students between the ages of 12-17 make up only 10% of monthly podcast listeners so it’s still a somewhat undiscovered medium that you can use to capture their attention, adding something that may be a perfect media to supercharge your class and curriculum!</p>
<p>Even if you’re a total newbie, getting started with podcasts in the classroom is an easy skill to add to your teaching toolbag. Whether you’re using them to listen together or individually, or you’re having your students record their own podcasts, there’s space for podcasts in any syllabus.</p>

Do you want to appeal to your audience’s ears and eyes?  There’s no doubt that by looking into your audience’s eyes deepens the relationship and builds a stronger connection with them and that’s definitely a benefit of doing a video podcast.
<p>But when you’re putting together an audio podcast there are a lot of things to take into consideration especially if you want a high-quality show.  Creating a video takes you to another level because you need to consider a whole bunch of additional factors, like…<strong>"Do I look Good?"</strong></p>
<p>No seriously, money and experience is a major part of video production, everything from the lighting, the sound, the stage setup, etc.  Everything that could potentially make a viewer say <strong>“What the heck am I watching?”</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a film school graduate or you have a production company you probably have video equipment, lighting and boom mics.  But if you’re just starting out you’re either going to have to hire a professional production company to produce your videos or purchase professional equipment and learn to do it yourself.</p>
<p>If you’ll just be using your iPhone or Android Smartphone to record you will still have to put time into thinking about your set, the lighting, the sound and of course the editing.  When recording an audio podcast you can record in your pajamas, sweats and a T-shirt, but when using a camera you have to think about what you are wearing and how you look.</p>
<strong>A video podcast is less convenient for your listening audience</strong>
<p>Your audience can actively listen to your content while multitasking - driving the car, walking the dog, doing the dishes, etc.   However, with a video they can’t consume your content on the go and they have to be stationary to watch from a computer, tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>So think about it, will you do add video or just voice podcasting?</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Show notes encourage people to come to your website<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally you want to continue the relationship with your audience after they have listened to your show, so getting people to your website or blog via your show notes page gives them an opportunity in which to do so.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Show notes are great for SEO<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want your podcast to be found by new listeners it needs to be indexed and featured in search results.  Unfortunately, Google can’t search MP3 files (at least not yet) so you need to include important keywords that are said in your podcast to be somewhere on the internet where the Google bots can find them.  Remember to make them readable with at least 300 words.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Show notes allows you share the links to other resources<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use your show notes to direct listeners to any links that you may have mentioned in the episode including affiliate links, online courses, books and<strong> </strong>invite them to join your email list for newsletter and podcast updates.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Show notes increase your authority<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The more content you have online the more legitimate you’ll look online to the search engines and others when they are searching online.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show notes can be viewed on all devices<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When sharing your episodes you want a link that’s going to work for everyone no matter what device they’re using, Android or Apple which is not the case with some podcasting platforms.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Show notes are a great reference tool for your audience<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide links or mention articles or just want to share your guest’s information,  you can include them in your  show notes.  Listeners won’t need to take notes or re-listen to portions of your podcast for links they may have missed.</p>
<p>There are many other important reasons for show notes and I invite you to share some of your own and when you are ready to start your own podcast, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@ablakeenterprises.com" rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">info@ablakeenterprises.com</a> to schedule your 30-Min Complimentary Discovery Call or to enroll in the 90-Min Mini Coaching Session which is a great investment of $97.</p>

<p><strong>If you have committed to starting a podcast or even a blog you may want to jump in with both feet just to get started.  However, no matter how anxious you are to get started, let me tell you one thing first, "slow your roll" and line up your ducks first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I started my first podcast in 2012 and my first podcast in 2017 - I am still updating and adding  and learning, so here are just 5 tips that I am sharing with you for when you are starting your podcast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Client shoutouts!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slow Your Roll Tip #1</strong> - <strong>Don't spend a lot of money on equipment </strong>- everyone is anxious to have the latest and greatest piece of equipment - but wait, use your mic on the phone or an inexpensive condenser mic before going out to purchase fancy expensive equipment for a home studio - there are too many ways to record on the low - in your closet or under a fort and if you wait to save up for the latest and greatest equipment you may be waiting weeks, months or even years and then give up!</p>
<p><strong>Slow Your Roll Tip #2 - Build a Foundation - </strong>you may be thinking that your podcast is just a hobby, but think of it as a jobby - why, because it’s your brand and you want it to be as good as it can get from the giddy up even though there will be tumbles along the way.  But think of it as an investment into your media brand, have fun but it may be the catalyst for something bigger - perhaps a tv show or major sponsorship!!??</p>
<p><strong>Slow Your Roll Tip #3 - Listen to advice from those in the know - </strong>don’t be so cocky that you can’t learn from others - but choose those “others” wisely -  listen to their videos and podcasts, read, share and grow as there is always room for improvement even it you have been podcasting since 2000!  Remember, your network is your net worth so sign up for course or listen to audio from those in the know that are doing the darn thing!</p>
<p><strong>Slow Your Roll Tip #4 - Waiting and Procrastinating - Imposter Syndrome is real!  </strong>Don’t allow fear or intimidation of other’s success stop you from starting.  If you fear that you are not deserving of success, even if you are helping only 1 person or have a handful of listeners, don’t delay your launch especially if you are passionate about your topic.  Every day that you delay your launch is a delay of success.  “You don’t have to be great to get started, but you do have to get started to be great!”</p>
<p><strong>Slow Your Roll Tip #5 - Checking Your Numbers - stop it!</strong></p>
<p>If you want to have a successful podcast you have to stop thinking about how many downloads you have - think about what really matters.  You are the voice behind the vision - you are the SME, you are building onto your brand, you are leaving a legacy!</p>
<p>As a new podcaster you will grow and get better, but don't wait and allow others to determine your path - remember “you have to do you boo boo!”</p>

<p><strong>Now that you are ready to launch your podcast, the description or trailer is very important, it's like the cover of a book. It’s what people read</strong><em><strong> before listening to your show</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A podcast description or trailer should cover these three topics:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>Explanation Statement: Tell your listeners what they can expect to hear on each of your episode so they can determine if it's worth the listening investment of time.<br />
</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Frequency / Where to Find It:  How often are your shows, weekly, bi-weekly or daily - let the listeners know so that they will invest in your show.<br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>CTA - Call to action:  Make sure to always tell your listeners what you want them to do after listening to your show, i.e. share, subscribe, listen for more, etc.</strong></li>
