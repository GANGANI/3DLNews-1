LeMaster into their living rooms to break down the news of the day and hold the powerful accountable. \n\nC.J. also co-anchors WLBT News at 5 p.m. alongside Maggie Wade.\n\nSince he began serving as WLBT's lead investigative reporter in 2016, C.J. has uncovered <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2019/01/31/your-side-investigates-pattern-secrecy/\">misleading crime statistics from the Jackson Police Department</a>, exposed a <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2022/07/14/3-your-side-investigates-under-influence/\">Rankin County elected official’s drunken behavior hours before he would face a felony rape charge</a>, revealed a <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/story/36044334/exclusive-3-on-your-side-investigation-prison-payday/\">prison extortion scheme that stretched across the state </a> and helped uncover <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2021/08/12/pandemic-profits-heres-how-hinds-co-spent-more-than-18-million-election-grant-funding/\">misspending in Hinds County</a> that led to the <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2023/01/26/no-jail-time-co-conspirators-who-pleaded-guilty-hinds-county-embezzlement-bribery-scandal/\">conviction of three people</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2023/01/09/jury-selection-begins-monday-embezzlement-trial-hinds-co-election-commissioner/\">removal of an election commissioner from public office.</a>\n\nA scathing <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2022/08/18/exclusive-emails-reveal-staffing-shortage-threatened-shut-down-water-treatment-plants/\">3 On Your Side investigation into Jackson’s water crisis with Anthony Warren </a> ended with the city <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2022/09/09/mary-carter-ousted-deputy-director-water-operations-amid-jacksons-ongoing-water-crisis/\">firing the whistleblower in the case</a> and demoting its public works director, who <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2022/09/14/former-public-works-director-says-carter-was-terminated-performance-not-going-media/\">would later resign.</a>\n\nMost recently, a <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2023/12/22/3-your-side-investigates-side-hustle/\">year-long inquiry into possible misuse of taxpayer dollars by Richland's mayor and Pearl's police chief through side jobs they held with Rankin County</a> led to <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2024/01/19/pearls-police-chief-resigns-weeks-after-wlbt-investigation-into-timesheet-discrepancies-with-his-county-job/\">both men resigning from their city</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2024/01/05/employees-named-wlbt-investigation-into-timesheet-discrepancies-resign-rankin-county-tax-assessors-office/\">county jobs</a>. The piece also triggered an <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2024/01/19/pearl-mayor-auditor-looking-into-former-police-chief/\">investigation from the State Auditor's office.</a>\n\nC.J.'s work has resulted in six Emmy nominations, twenty-two state awards and the First Amendment Award of Excellence five years in a row, highlighting his dogged use of public records in investigations. In a landmark case, the <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2021/08/06/city-jackson-slapped-with-largest-fine-state-history-following-wlbt-ethics-complaint/\"> Mississippi Ethics Commission levied the largest judgment in state history against the city of Jackson </a> for failing to produce public records to WLBT. His team has filed four public records complaints against agencies in the last eight years, winning three of them to help ensure greater transparency for residents in Mississippi.\n\nBefore coming to the Capital City as a reporter and weekend anchor in December 2013, C.J. worked at WTVA/WLOV in Tupelo, Mississippi, for nearly a decade in several roles, some of that while pursuing a broadcast journalism degree from Mississippi State.\n\nAfter graduation, he got hired as a reporter there and then went on to anchor some of the station’s top-rated newscasts.\n\nC.J. was raised in Booneville, where he began his journalism career at Northeast Mississippi Community College. He worked in both print and television during his time in college.\n\nWhen he’s not working, C.J. enjoys finding new restaurants in central Mississippi and exploring the area with a camera to support his photography habit.\n\nIf you have something you want C.J. to look into, email him at coleman.lemaster@wlbt.com.","org":"WLBT","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Investigative Reporter","slug":"c-j-lemaster","source":{"source_id":"24634681"},"status":true,"twitter":"CJLeMaster","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2024-05-01T15:45:08.739Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wlbt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"8"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T00:18:35.093Z","description":{"basic":"A Rankin County judge has dismissed a restraining order at the request of a woman who previously claimed a state trooper sexually exploited her."},"headlines":{"basic":"Rankin County judge dismisses restraining order in MHP sex scandal case at alleged victim’s request","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM","additional_properties":{"countryId":227,"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/02Gc7M8D8R83kOUIDMAumlBstEQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_job_identifier":"MSRS201","iptc_source":"AP","iptc_title":"STF","keywords":[""],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"AP22220798488500.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM.jpg","owner":"josh.carter@wlbt.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/02Gc7M8D8R83kOUIDMAumlBstEQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/02Gc7M8D8R83kOUIDMAumlBstEQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-05-17T13:44:43Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/iLUJiBTizVuNS5Mljq5gq17nxyw=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/OUP7RHWCABG5PCUZM5PFWLAJQM.jpg","usage_instructions":"THIS IS A MAY 17, 2022 PHOTOGRAPH.","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{"locality":"Jackson","region":"MS","country_name":"USA"},"auth":{"3":"4f5b7f3a607b9d47289334bb19d5e3f0b3945e6be7ebd1e224049141287140c4"},"caption":"","copyright":"Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

He looks forward to serving the people of Central Mississippi and loves meeting new people so don't be shy to say hi if you see him out and about.\n\nIn his free time he loves watching hockey (Go Stars), working out, and enjoying a good book but sometimes finds it hard to get into books since working on the mornings as a good nap sounds much better. Chase has always loved weather and is so excited to share what he has learned over his years of storm chasing as he drives to be the best meteorologist he can be and is always open to criticism.

The piece also triggered an <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2024/01/19/pearl-mayor-auditor-looking-into-former-police-chief/\">investigation from the State Auditor's office.</a>\n\nC.J.'s work has resulted in six Emmy nominations, twenty-two state awards and the First Amendment Award of Excellence five years in a row, highlighting his dogged use of public records in investigations. In a landmark case, the <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2021/08/06/city-jackson-slapped-with-largest-fine-state-history-following-wlbt-ethics-complaint/\"> Mississippi Ethics Commission levied the largest judgment in state history against the city of Jackson </a> for failing to produce public records to WLBT. His team has filed four public records complaints against agencies in the last eight years, winning three of them to help ensure greater transparency for residents in Mississippi.\n\nBefore coming to the Capital City as a reporter and weekend anchor in December 2013, C.J. worked at WTVA/WLOV in Tupelo, Mississippi, for nearly a decade in several roles, some of that while pursuing a broadcast journalism degree from Mississippi State.\n\nAfter graduation, he got hired as a reporter there and then went on to anchor some of the station’s top-rated newscasts.\n\nC.J. was raised in Booneville, where he began his journalism career at Northeast Mississippi Community College. He worked in both print and television during his time in college.\n\nWhen he’s not working, C.J. enjoys finding new restaurants in central Mississippi and exploring the area with a camera to support his photography habit.\n\nIf you have something you want C.J. to look into, email him at coleman.lemaster@wlbt.com.","org":"WLBT","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Investigative

She graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Mississippi where she was also a Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College graduate.\n\nWhile at Ole Miss, Courtney Ann worked as anchor, reporter and producer for NewsWatch, the student-run live broadcast. She was selected as the station's only credentialed Spin Alley reporter at the 2008 Presidential Debate that was held on campus. She continued to sharpen her reporting skills while working as an intern for Talk Radio News Service in Washington, D.C. She reported daily on Senate and House hearings, press conferences and various events throughout the city.\nShe has worked as an on-air reporter in Jackson since 2010. She is currently on air for both WLBT and FOX 40 and is the 6:00 p.m. co-anchor and statewide reporter. As part of her statewide duties, she sends stories Monday-Friday to WCBI (Columbus), WTOK (Meridian), WDAM (Hattiesburg) and WLOX (Biloxi). \nJackson received the first place for TV Reporter in a Large Market during the 2021 Mississippi Association of Broadcasters Excellence in Broadcasting Awards. \n\nJackson covers the State Capitol during the legislative sessions each year, often times gaining exclusive interviews with policymakers and helping break down the most complex issues of the day for viewers across the state. Her statewide coverage isn’t limited to the Capitol. For example, she was sent to Los Angeles in 2016 to cover the American Idol finale and is often sent to other parts of the state for significant breaking news and weather events.\n\nShe’s covered a wide range of stories, including: presidential visits, prison riot protests, sit-down interviews with governors, votes and commission meetings to change and replace the state flag, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, statewide and congressional elections…just to name a few.\n\nCourtney Ann served as a panelist for the 2018 Mississippi U.S. Senate Debate hosted by WLBT and Mississippi Farm Bureau which was televised across the state. Her insight into that Senate special election also afforded her the opportunity to provide a Facebook live conversation for NBC News on how Mississippi’s election could impact the makeup of the Senate. \n\nJackson shoots and edits her own video, writes the stories and then appears on camera daily.\n\nHaving grown up in Mississippi, Courtney Ann knows there are extraordinary stories to be told in this state and she looks forward to uncovering more of them.\nCourtney Ann enjoys spending time with her husband, family and friends. When she’s not at work, she can be found cooking, entertaining, dancing, traveling, and exploring locally owned shops and restaurants.

Eager to get involved in the media as a child, Patrice worked at a radio station in New Orleans, AM 940, as a co-host of a local teen talk show.\nPatrice graduated from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana.  During college, she worked as a Reporter/Anchor for her college television station and KTIB local radio station. She also interned at FOX 8 News in New Orleans.\nAfter earning a degree in Journalism, Patrice moved back to her hometown and worked at WWL Television as an assistant assignment editor. She also helped produce the youth program \"Our Generation.\"\nPatrice then moved to South Mississippi to work as a tape-editor at WLOX, but she was determined to be in front the camera. In her off time, she worked on her writing and storytelling.  After a lot of hard work, her dream came true and she was offered the Jackson County bureau chief position.  She was also a weekend live reporter and fill-in anchor at WLOX.   In 2016, She made a move to Jackson, Mississippi, to continue telling people stories.\nShe has interviewed business leaders, former presidents, governors, and Hollywood celebrities. But what touches Patrice's heart the most is helping and informing people in the community, a goal she fights to accomplish with each story.\nWhile at WLBT, Patrice has won first place for Best Public Affairs reporting from the Louisiana-Mississippi Associated Press Broadcasters and Media Editors. She also won first place for best Short Light Feature.\nPatrice also reached an educational milestone in 2019. She graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mass Communication at Jackson State University. On top of that, she was the Salutatorian of her program.\nWhen Patrice is not chasing a breaking news, she loves traveling, reading good books, and spending time with her family, friends, and sorority sisters. Yes, she is proud member of Delta Sigma Theta. But shopping is Patrice's true love. She and her mom can spend all day going from store to store.\nPatrice is also very spiritual; she credits the Lord for all her blessings, including her journalism career.","org":"WLBT","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News
