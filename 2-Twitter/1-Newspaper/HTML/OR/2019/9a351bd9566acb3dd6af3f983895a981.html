 <p class="story">(NEW YORK) - The coach and players of the Rutgers University women’s basketball team said Friday that they have accepted the apology delivered by radio personality Don Imus at the New Jersey governor’s mansion on Thursday night.</p>

<p class="story">C. Vivian Stringer : “We, the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights basketball team, accept Mr. Imus’ apology, and we are now in the process of forgiving. We still find his statements unacceptable, and this experience is one that we will never forget. </p>

<p class="story">“These comments are indicative of a greater ill in our culture. It is not just Mr. Imus, and we hope that this will serve as a catalyst for change. Let us continue to work hard together to make this world a better place. As adults we must be leaders in society. We must put children and morality above all else. And we must allow children to be children. </p>

<p class="story">“The healing process must begin. As for the members of the Rutgers University women’s basketball team, their focus needs to return to their studies. We ask that you respect that. We would also like to thank everyone for the tremendous outpouring of support throughout this very, very difficult time.”</p>

<p class="story">Imus’s wife, Deirdre, broadcasting this morning in his former time slot on WFAN during it’s annual Radiothon charity drive, described the basketball team as “unbelievably courageous and beautiful women.”</p>

<p class="story">She added that those who are sending hate mail to the team must stop. “If you want to send hate mail, send it to my husband.”</p>

<p class="story">The show's charity fundraiser had raised more than $1.3 million Thursday before Imus lost his job. </p>

<p class="story">The total, Friday had grown to more than $3.2 million for Tomorrows Children's Fund, CJ Foundation for SIDS and the Imus Ranch.</p>

<p class="story">Imus and his wife founded the Imus Ranch, a working cattle ranch near Ribera, New Mexico, 50 miles southeast of Santa Fe. The Imus Ranch is a charitable organization for children with cancer, as well as siblings of SIDS victims.</p>

<p class="story">The annual Radiothon event has raised more than $40 million since 1990.

Thank you soooo very muuuch.</p><hr />Albert Marnell April 16, 2007 12:49 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Sharpton,

I do live in a cave, very secure in the form of a condo.  Real Estate to me is just a form of modern caves and huts.  I am not romantic about them.  It is shelter.  Are you going to tell me that the world in not horribly corrupt?  I stay away from trouble, I can smell it a mile away.  I used to believe the police were so needed and of course we need  better trained people in law enforcement with regards to sensitivity issues.  But what I have personally dealt with dozens of times including having two cops abuse my mother in front of me when I was 10 years old and were going to leave me abandoned because they probably were going to rape her because she was in a bathing suit and was a model, have not left me with a fondness of law enforcement.  She used some quick thinking to get away from them but was shaking and crying.  And no this was not one unusual incident.  The more densely populated an area you are in, the more you have to deal with them.  I will not go into the other stories of them victimizing innocent people in front of me or when they did not know I was looking.  As a Funeral Director friend once said to me because he had to deal with them all of the time..."They are all cut out of the same mold."  I am know there are a few exceptions but the numbers are disconcerting.  And they can be friendly when they get what they want.  I am not the one who lives in fantasy so I am not the one in danger.  </p><hr />Sharpton April 16, 2007 7:17 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Marnell you appear to be someone who prefers anarchy. If so, I don't believe you would thrive in that environment. Possibly you should go find a cave, stock it with supplies, and withdraw from this world you obviously find so horribly corrupt. Me thinks you rationalize too much. A little information and facts mixed with fantasy can be pretty unhealthy. Good luck to you in that world you reside in.</p><hr />Albert Marnell April 16, 2007 12:16 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Sharpton

Go to www.badcopnews.com Your position is extreme and a bit of Cowboy and Indian.  The police are mostly a problem.  I have lived it and it does not matter which state you are in.  They are involved in drug dealing, organized crime...usually not at the start.  Check out the sight and you will see that be it Oregon or New York, the little that surfaces might change your opinion of them and put them in a realistic light.  </p><hr />Sharpton April 15, 2007 6:36 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">All in all we have the best police force on the planet. They need more resources, and we should demand higher and higher standards from them. Good cops know how valuable it is to have well-armed and well trained citizens out there. The rank and file most definitely support Concealed Handgun Licenses. Look at the data, the CHL people have a lower crime rate than the police. It's that way all over the country. Fight the Brady Bunch gungrabbers, they are liar'S! My Motto: Buy a gun every month and train at least 5 people a month how to shoot!</p><hr />Hey White Boy Sharpton April 15, 2007 3:08 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">You are right Sharpton, the cost benefit analysis of Police in the traditional sense renders them basically useless and creates a climate that makes it tempting for them to collude in all sorts of skulldugery.</p><hr />Sharpton April 15, 2007 12:15 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Thanks for clearing that up. So I can continue to use "nappy-time" for my children , great. I hate to think some racist' morons want me to suffer from having my speech censored. So when AL Sharpton (ordained at 11, never went to a seminary, nor finished any school actually-likewise for Jackson) uses the term "Diamond merchants" in place of jews, or tells his flock of fellow people of like-mindedness, that the Greeks, like "Socrates and other Greek homo's were living in caves when the black man was doing astronomy, advanced mathematics, and flying airplanes (true about the planes---see African Baseline Studies)", that that is fine. Haha. Thank your lucky stars you have the 2nd Amendment, cuz the cops won't protect you fom the real racists out there. Though they're great at drawing chalk lines around victims.</p><hr />Hey White Boy Sharpton April 14, 2007 7:40 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Your mixing apples and oranges.  There is a big difference between a bleach blonde headed ho and what Anus said.  Nappy hair has never been regarded by the larger culture of something of beauty when in fact beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.  It still has not hit many white brains that black is beautiful and nappy is beautiful.  Alot of black people especially black women have bought into the notion that nappy hair needs to be straight to be pretty.  This is kind of like internalized homophobia of gay people that have bought into the notion that if you are not heterosexual, you have less or no value.  Mainstream cultural predjudice and ignorance can really play with the average mind.  Luckily a few black women know that they a beautiful as they are and do not go for the Madison Avenue old vision of what the ideal is in terms of looks.  Be a little decent and not so immature and cruel even though there are many people that will not be hurt by your comment but will just think of you as a jerk. </p><hr />Sharpton April 14, 2007 5:46 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Would saying to your kids it's "nappy-time" be a faux paus. Please, anybody, I need to know before I say it again to them. I beseech you, let me know! Thank you.</p><hr />Olivia April 14, 2007 12:51 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">What about that disgusting, rude, know it all, brat they have?  He has to live on a vegan diet, not watch tv (except if dad lets him watch wrestling with him), is not permitted to enjoy the "heros" of young boys, Superman, GI Joe, etc. I saw him on the show once and he told Charles that he (Charles) is a d__ - Imus laughed and the kid said it again.  Mom said a weak "stop that"...She must be livid  because she had to cancel her "green" book tour.  However, those players had better get used to comments once they are out in the real world.</p><hr />Phony Spotter April 13, 2007 1:36 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">What is a young woman like her doing with an old bag like Anus?  What is the difference between prostitution and marrying for money?  Don't tell me she really loves him Anna Nicole with your clipped Wings.  Neither of them needs to work and he is ready to die anyway....he is such a picture of vodka and cocaine abuse.  That I can sympathize with but the money HOE stuff burns me up.  There are so many great men looking for a decent woman and then they sell themselves out just like hos.  That is fine too, but be honest about it.  Tell people, I really married him for the money! $$$$$$$$$$$$$  She's a real bleach blonde headed ho!</p><a HREF="#top"><b>[Return to Top]</b></a>
