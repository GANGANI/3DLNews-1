 <p class="story">(SALEM) - <table align='left'><tr><td><img width="230" src='/gphotos/1330743383.jpg'><p class='caption'><b>The photo shows what it appears to <br>show... an unexploded SLA rocket has<br> pierced this Tamil woman's lower body.</b></p></td></tr></table>One of the most contentious aspects of the Sri Lanka Genocide involves the routing of civilian refugees into so-called 'safe zones' - where Sri Lanka's Army inevitably rained bombs down onto their heads and just smashed people into pieces.</p>

<p class="story">This is just one part of the terrible Sri Lanka civil war under a microscope with the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) in Geneva, Switzerland.   </p>

<p class="story">Some place estimates of civilian casualties in the neighborhood of 40,000, others cite twice that many.  What we know is that when the smoke cleared,  after the culmination of the slaughter in May 2009, more than 160,000 Tamil people had vanished from existence.</p>

<p class="story">Along with the rampant deaths and injuries from the extended, military pounding, are a host of other key, significant aspects under examination by UNHCR.  One, perhaps the most disgusting, are incidents of bizarre sexual depravity, which I expand on below.</p>

<p class="story">Another area of investigation- the 'white flag' surrenders of Tamil Tiger military leaders who were deceived into believing they could somehow help end the violence against civilians by surrendering to the SLA.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='center'><tr><td><a href="http://www.notosrilanka.com/"><img src='/gphotos/1308398821.jpg'></a></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">The sad reality always leads back to the same conclusion: that there seemed to be no real interest in avoiding violence on the part of Sri Lanka; the national government and its military forces were only bent on killing Tamils.</p>

<p class="story"><h3>A Very Un<i>ethical</i> civil War</h3></p>

<p class="story"><table align='left'><tr><td><img src='/gphotos/1330754968.jpg'><p class='caption'></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story"><table align='right' float='right'><tr><td><img src='/gphotos/1330743780.jpg'><p class='caption'></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">Hostilities first erupted between the Sri Lanka government, which represents the dominant Sinhalese Buddhist culture, and Tamil separatists, thirty years ago. This story can be defined as one of thirty years of peaceful attempts by the Tamils to preserve their equality, and thirty years of violent resistance in the form of a civil war.</p>

<p class="story">What stands out among the long list of violent attacks, are the demoralizing tactics employed by the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) in bombing campaigns of refugee camps; repeatedly, civilians were told to go to areas that were, allegedly, demilitarized, and shortly after they entered the deplorable camps that were largely void of food and shelter, the attacks would begin and they were merciless.  </p>

<p class="story">Some Sinhalese advocates of the government's military action say all of the people killed were 'terrorists', which is their word for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelaam (LTTE), the 'Tamil Tigers'- a long standing and highly trained band of resistance fighters who defended the rights of the Tamil population, which accounts for about 18% of Sri Lanka, or so.  </p>

<p class="story">Others, I suspect even the same people on different days, in both email and story comments, say the Tigers entered the refugee camps and brought military equipment inside, and <i>that</i> is why the government trapped the people and killed them, transferring holdout pockets of humanity into the bloody pulp of non-existence.</p>

<p class="story">Other government advocates denied that the camps were attacked at all, that is, until they were forced to recognize what happened, as they have during each step of <b>Channel-4's</b> official revelations.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='right' float='right'><tr><td><img width="400" src='/gphotos/1330743556.jpg'><p class='caption'></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">It is a fact that officials denied allegations strongly backed up by prominent amounts of video and photo evidence; even going so far as to accuse <b>Ch-4</b> of having a personal vendetta against Sri Lanka, which is ridiculous.  Then, with no remaining choices, the SL government would eventually relent a little bit when the UN or a similar agency would verify the authenticity of the tapes and images.  </p>

<p class="story">War crimes are not something to be judged by this manner of negotiation, what it is clear is that the Rajapaksa regime is here to do what it wants to its perceived enemies, resistance fighters and otherwise, and then it practices damage control.</p>

<p class="story">I <i>know</i> those officials are squirming in Geneva right now and hating every step of the way, it is a very sad story.  There are incredible Sinhalese people who never gave their endorsement to the overwhelming military Genocide.  </p>

<p class="story">However like the Israeli advocates of Palestine's suffering, any manner of retaliation awaits those who utter a single word.  This brings to mind the incredible resilience of present-day reporters in Colombo, who have unrelenting courage and refuse to pander to the government's wishes.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='center'><tr><td><a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/march192011/palestine-babies-aw.php"><img src='/gphotos/1315171650.jpg'></a></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">Of course Sri Lanka has also been clamping down on the last refuge of free press; Websites.  Those that are not pro-government are increasingly being shut down and blocked within Sri Lanka.  This boosts the importance of our coverage greatly, which the country has no control over.  </p>

<p class="story">The truth is that the matter is now representing Sri Lanka at large and perhaps it should.  On a daily basis, government terrorism continues to plague the island: from Tamil refugees suffering in secret camps, to tourists from places like Moscow and Gaza being raped and murdered at beach-side resorts.  </p>

<p class="story">The infamous 'white van' disappearances continue to take place and for anyone in this country who dares support the plight of the Tamils, there is immense danger.</p>

<p class="story">The SL govt song and dance and list of excuses over the perceived, 'Tamil terrorist' is a long-winded excuse for a simmering ethnic tension that is rooted in Great Britain's long running colonization of 'Ceylon', Sri Lanka's previous national name, that ended in 1948.  </p>

<p class="story">The British masters gave preference to Tamils, it is a situation this island culture has paid dearly for, and nearly identical in nature to the Genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu and Tutsi were divided by the colonial government, and one side given preference.  In each case, it is important to recall that the Tamils were selected by the Brits to be the preferred culture, not the other way around.</p>

<p class="story"><h3>Historical Resistance</h3></p>

<p class="story"><table align='right' float='right'><tr><td><img src='/gphotos/1330747413.jpg'><p class='caption'></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">Slowly, in the years following 1948, the Sinhalese tried to eliminate the Tamil culture; laws were passed that reduced rights, and it was decided that the Tamil language would be eliminated... Tamils found themselves living under apartheid laws, like South Africa and Israel.  </p>

<p class="story">For 30 years, Tamils sought peaceful negotiations under a non-violent premise, during which this largely Hindu and partly Christian culture, employed the rules written by Gandhi.  Eventually the undeniable truth was recognized, that non-violence was not-working.  </p>

<p class="story">It isn't as if the Tamils didn't try long and hard, for three decades, to avoid violence.</p>

<p class="story">The Tamil Tigers formed in the 1970's and by 1983, the war was growing in intensity.  The Tigers learned a hard lesson when they killed 13 SLA soldiers during combat operations in a period remembered as 'Black July'.  </p>

<p class="story">What they discovered, was that their military achievements against government forces, would be meted by Sinhalese Buddhists attacking Tamil civilians.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='left'><tr><td><img width="375" src='/gphotos/1330770763.jpg'><p class='caption'></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">Somewhere between 400 and 3000 Tamils were killed in the violence, and tens of thousands of Tamil houses destroyed.  The fear from this Sinhalese mob violence created a wave of of fleeing Sri Lankan Tamils who relocated to other countries.
 
Regardless of labels, for many people in this world, the LTTE is a heroic band of freedom fighters and while they  killed non-combatants after the SLA showed Tamils how the game was played that day in <i>Black July</i>, they are vastly ill-portrayed.</p>

<p class="story">In that context, the LTTE's accomplishments for the Tamil people; a solid infrastructure, educational system and government, are not recognized.</p>

<p class="story">Then there is the most damning element; a nagging white elephant that is rarely mentioned; when the SLA moved north for the final push in 2005, after achieving the act of having the LTTE labeled as a 'terrorist group' with the help of the Bush administration, the government itself violated a standing agreement that was brokered in Oslo... a cease-fire.  It is highly reminiscent of the treatment the Native Americans received during what are recalled as 'The Indian Wars', where treaties were broken frequently by the American government, almost randomly.  </p>

<p class="story"><h3>Gunawanse's Acts Represent Sri Lanka</h3></p>

<p class="story"><table align="left"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://globalpeacesupport.com/globalpeacesupport.com/post/2011/07/29/Massacre-of-Prisonerse28093Black-July-1983.aspx"><img src="/gphotos/1329810305.jpg"/></a><p class="caption"><b>July 1983 Massacre of Tamils</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p class="story">Elle Gunawanse, widely described as a 'firebrand' Buddhist monk, is now being appointed to the police commission in Sri Lanka.  This 'religious leader' had strong links to a terrible attack on Tamil civilians 29 years ago.  </p>

<p class="story">Rather than being humble, Gunawanse was laden with state funds; he purchased a status symbol Pajero Jeep – a symbol of overt wealth, not exactly a humble Buddhist approach.  </p>

<p class="story">Sinha Ratnatunga’s (now the Editor in Chief – Sunday Times) book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Politics_of_terrorism.html?id=3QS0AAAACAAJ"><em><b>Politics of Terrorism: The Sri Lankan Experience</b></em></a> released in 1988, describes Gunawanse's important role in the events of July 1983, remembered as 'Black July in Tamil Eelam.  The book describes how the monk appeared at the scene of the military battle, trying to whip up the emotions of the crowd at Borella cemetery.</p>

<p class="story"><table align="right"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sri-Lanka-arrogance-decadence-murder/dp/9559447041"><img src="/gphotos/1329809704.jpg"/></a><p class="caption"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sri-Lanka-arrogance-decadence-murder/dp/9559447041"><b>Order from Amazon</b></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p class="story">Gunawanse wanted to harness the anger of the crowd and turn it against the Tamils, and in this regard he had a tragic amount of success.  The monk played on the alleged mutilated condition of the bodies to incite the crowd, demanding that the bodies be shown – ‘even a little dismembered finger’. That was the beginning of the holocaust.</p>

<p class="story">The monk is shown on the evening of the 24th of July, asking the Army funeral authorities to show the bodies of the dead soldiers before they are interred. There is an oblique reference to in Ratnatunga’s book, that the monk who had come uninvited to the cemetery, who, that same evening, led a mob down Cotta Road, Borella, with a list in hand. </p>

<p class="story">He was subsequently reported being seen at the Cinnamon Gardens Police station, having come in a jeep with a pistol tucked under his robes, demanding curfew passes. The longest reference to Gunawanse’s activities appears on page 32 regarding the events following the late night cabinet meeting on 27th July. (Read  “<i>Sri Lanka: Arrogance of Power – Rajan Hole</i>.”  for an in-depth analysis of Gunawanse’s criminal behavior and also see: <b>Feb-20-2012:</b> <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/february202012/gunawanse-appointment.php"><b>A Criminal Monk To The Police Commission</b></a>)</p>

<p class="story"><h3>Worst Sex Crimes Imaginable</h3></p>

<p class="story">As we have significantly documented, there were mass rapes of women and girls conducted by troops of the Sri Lanka Army.  They actually recorded the aftermath of one of these escapades on their own video cameras, and those images... loading nude female rape / murder victims into the back of a truck, include statements from the soldiers who joke in extremely callous, insensitive ways about the dead, mostly dead... or soon to be dead, female victims </p>

<p class="story">A soldier shockingly proclaims of one victim, that he "would like to cut her tits off".  What kind of people does Sri Lanka allow into its military?  In twenty years of news, covering the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and dozens of deaths, murders, and other terrible crimes; after all of that, I have never heard such foul words uttered in such a casual tone.  This goes right to the very soul of humanity as far as I am concerned, creatures like this existing as armed soldiers... the mere notion of it is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p class="story"><i>The nude bodies are kicked and treated like inanimate objects, while at least one of the women is clearly still alive.</i></p>

<p class="story">The above translations from Sinhala to written English were performed by <b>Channel-4</b> in London and they are indisputable.  As Presenter Jon Snow said, "<i>These disturbing scenes raise extremely serious questions for the government of Sri Lanka."</i>  </p>

<p class="story">This is the same military organization connected to terrible sex crimes in Haiti, where members of the SLA were deployed as part of UN peacekeeping forces, there to assist earthquake victims. </p>

<p class="story">Sri Lanka has a running history of severe corruption and the war crime allegations are enough to put it over the edge.  </p>

<p class="story">The only thing they are really even facing, is the implementation of their own measures as proposed by the Lessons Learnt & Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), it's own government investigation, and it barely attributes any wrongdoing to Sri Lanka, it blames the LTTE for everything, it scarcely scratches the surface of what took place, <i>and this they vehemently resist</i>?  </p>

<p class="story">The obvious problem is that this needs to be addressed in a serious way, like the Nuremberg Trials, not just to have a hand slap be the total extent of their punishment.  </p>

<p class="story">Even though it is terribly biased toward the SL govt, the LLRC report does contain sound recommendations and at a minimum, this will be a start of something that can grow.</p>

<p class="story">I have been written to by hundreds of people over our ongoing coverage of these matters involving Sri Lanka, and I want to make a point, and that is the main reason I have gotten into this so deeply, is because I am a father, and a son, and a brother, husband and uncle.  </p>

<p class="story">I have the greatest hope that future generations can heal this planet, end the suffering, straighten out the crooked thinking and religion-dominated governments that leads to so much dramatic tragedy.</p>

<p class="story">When I see the murdered Tamil children, it sends a chill down my spine and it is hard to look at the results of such cruel, calculated killing, just like in Gaza, without really wanting to do something about it.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='left' float='right'><tr><td><a href="eliteoftheworld.com"><img src='/gphotos/1330755302.jpg'></a><p class='caption'><b>Beautiful image of India's Mahatma Gandhi </b></p></td></tr></table> </p>

<p class="story">I refuse and will <i>always</i> refuse to endorse any government that subjects people to such horrible oppression; so fierce and unyielding that that the only answer is armed retaliation and resistance.  This is the story of the Tamil Tigers and other resistance organizations that are exactly the opposite of 'terrorists' to the people they support and protect.</p>

<p class="story">This brings us to an interesting point about the Tamil struggle.  When they tried for three decades to avoid violence, they found themselves deeper in the same struggle, no amount of political exchange could reverse the trends increasingly challenging this culture of people.</p>

<p class="story">Non-violent resistance has won battles, major ones like the Civil Rights period in the United States that began in the 1950's and culminated in the 1960's.  While non-violence is the bottom line, and the best approach, there is a point where it is weak and foolish and cowardly.  It was Gandhi who said:</p>

March 3, 2012 10:39 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments"><p>First I want to appreciate Tim King and Salem-News.com for their effort to bring The Tamil tragedy and the Genocide  of Tamils by SriLankan Govt.Tamils are living in Elam(North East of SriLanka) for more than 3000 years with their own Kingdom.After 1948,they are fighting for their Freedom for more than 60 years,30 years as non-violent and 30years as violent. In non-violent period,each and every year they are not only loosing their Rights,but also their self respect,their Honor,their wealth etc.Also the Srilankan Govt induced the Mass violence against Tamils and executed it with the help of police and Army personals.Hence Non-violent method lost its value among Tamils.Then Tamils slowly start to support violent method of freedom fighters like LTTE.Most of the people in the world doesn&#39;t know the history of Tamil&#39;s fight for their freedom and their history of their own kingdom  in Sri Lanka. British Govt, only in 1833, for their convenience, joined the Tamil Kingdom and the SriLankan Kingdom into one. But after 1948, British Govt. gave freedom only to SriLankan Govt. with majority of Simhala people. By their majority, they made the Tamils as their slaves. Elam became the colony  of SriLankan Govt. But the world doesn&#39;t understand it. Again I thank you for Tim King and Salem-news.com. </p><p><strong>Tim King: Thank you very much Balan. </strong><br /></p></p><hr />Sri Lankan Pride March 3, 2012 9:56 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Tim, even some of the most prominent tamil activists who are anti-sinhala, anti-sri lankan admit the LTTE killed many tamil civilians in addition to the thousands of Sinhala civilians. I can point you to scores of independent media reports where this is well documented. The LTTE also eliminated many of the moderate tamils. Killing any civilian is unacceptable be they tamils, sinhalese or muslims. I have yet to come across a war where there were no civilian casualties. The last time I checked it was the US that dropped the atom bomb on Japan to end the war. Were the US military leaders and political leaders tried for war crimes? I didnt think so. And what happened in sri lanka is no where close to japan. You say that you dont have a beef against the country or culture. If that is the case why dont you speak out also for the sinhala civilians that have been murdered. I have many tamil friends and I believe all nationalities should have equal rights. However equality does not mean I support my country being divided to satisfy economic refugees in the west. This is something we the sri lankan people will not allow.</p><hr />Sri Lankan Pride March 3, 2012 1:57 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments"><p><strong>Tim King: First, if I need information on terrorism supporters, I&#39;ll call your embassy, what better representative for terrorism exists?. Do you really think I get this information from the west? Think again, most of the support for the Tamils comes out of India and SL A good part of it has come right out of the victim&#39;s hands.. the few who survived that is..</strong><br /> <br /> Sri Lankan Pride: The last time I checked the sri lankan government is not a terrorist organization. The few that survived? There are more than 2 million tamils in sri lanka.. So that must be a lot of information gathering going on. Anyone can get information. The question is how credible is that information? Have you ever visited sri lanka? have you spoken to the thousands of the sinhala victims? Have you spoken to the tamil victims that were tortured and killed by the LTTE? Have you spoken to the many that were used as human shields by the LTTE and deliberately put in harms way? </p><p><strong>Tim King: I think that human shield idea is typically an excuse for killing civilians in war crimes, I refuse to believe that the LTTE intentionally had Tamils killed, that does not add up.&nbsp; I have been in Europe and Asia, I have not been to Sri Lanka and would probably not be murdered for the first several hours.... No, like so many people I have not been to Sri Lanka, though that has little to do with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p></p><hr />Sri Lankan Pride March 3, 2012 9:25 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments"><p>The lawfully elected government of sri lanka was engaged in  war with the LTTE - a banned terrorist organization in 30+ countries. The LTTE was classified as one of the deadliest terror organization by many international agencies including those in the US. The LTTE has killed thousands of sinhala civilians however the likes of Tim King conveniently ignore this and instead try to persecute the govt that was freeing the country from terror. We the people of Sri Lanka fully support our government and our armed forces for freeing our country from the reign of terror. It is a relief to us to be able to go about our daily lives sans bombs, suicide attacks and thousands of people from all communities being killed and maimed. I have included a Youtube clip that summarises the attrocities committed by the LTTE terrorists against the Sinhala people just during the month of October. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC7IUYDhlkkandsafe=active"><strong>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC7IUYDhlkkandsafe=active</strong></a><br /> <br /> We will never let the hypocrites in the west try to meddle in our internal affairs. Even the Palestinians whom Tim King is so passionate about fully back Sri Lanka in its fight against terror. Ironically the hypocrites in the west are sending their military forces to sri lanka to learn from our military. Now why would one want to do that if our military is committing war crimes. Also why does the UN enlist sri lankan forces to serve in peace keeping missions? Points to ponder. </p><p><strong>Tim King: Again, you fail to address the Tamil tragedy, you talk about thousands of civilians killed and I am talking about tens of thousands maybe closer to 200k. One very finite difference between you and I is that you are a nationalist and I am a humanitarian.&nbsp; Sure,&nbsp; you represent SL well, downright unrelenting, but it isn&#39;t responsible and sticking to your guns instead of admitting that your country screwed up is not making you appear in a better light.&nbsp; I made your link live and I also want to say again that this is not a beef against a country or a culture, it is a problem about war crimes and unregulated, undisciplined soldiers running roughshod over humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br /></p></p><a HREF="#top"><b>[Return to Top]</b></a>
