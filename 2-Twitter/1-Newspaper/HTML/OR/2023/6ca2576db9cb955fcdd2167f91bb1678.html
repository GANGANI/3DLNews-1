 <p class="story">(WASHINGTON D.C.) - <b>Note from Publisher:</b> <i>In an effort to assist our government in keeping information "transparent", we are publishing this important article by Wayne Madsen,   on the father of Rahm Emanuel. You won't find his bio on wikipedia, or any where else easily accessed. It has been deleted. </i></p>

<p class="story"><i>Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel held a top position in our country's leadership and his example of ethics and integrity is of the highest importance. This is not diminished regardless of his aspirations to leave the national spotlight and become the mayor of Chicago.</i></p>

<p class="story"><i>But, it seems, some secrets must just be harder to share. This revealing article will leave you with a better understanding of why no one wants to talk about Benjamin Emanuel. And why they should.<br> - Bonnie King</i></p>

<p class="story"><img src='/gphotos/1296088527.jpg' align='left'>A well-placed British source informed WMR that Rahm Emanuel's father, Benjamin Emanuel, specialized in the terrorist bombings of buses carrying British troops and policemen during the British Mandate in Palestine.</p>

<p class="story">British MI-6 files contain information on the elder Emanuel's participation in the terrorist activities of Irgun Zvai Leumi, a Jewish terrorist organization that targeted British forces, UN officials, and Palestinian Arabs in the lead up to Israeli independence in 1948.</p>

<p class="story"><table align='right' float='right'><tr><td><img src='/gphotos/1296088784.jpg'><p class='caption'><b>Emanuel's father Benjamin was part of<br> the Israeli assassin team that murdered<br> Sweden's Count [Folke] Bernadotte in '48.<br> Bernadotte was the UN envoy in Palestine<br> who sought to find a solution to the UN<br> Partition Plan that gave Palestinian land<br> to Jews from "beyond the pale." </b></p></td></tr></table></p>

<p class="story">Benjamin Emanuel, a Jew from Russia whose real name was Ezekiel Auerbach, was arrested by British police for terrorist activities in the months prior to Israeli independence. </p>

<p class="story">Many of the British policemen killed by Emanuel and his Irgun colleagues between 1947 and 1948 had been transferred to Palestine upon Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947. Irgun saw the increase of British policemen from the Indian subcontinent as a major threat.</p>

<p class="story">The Jewish terrorist murders of British troops and policemen resulted in massive anti-Jewish riots in London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester, and Cardiff in 1947. In 1946, Emanuel's Irgun bombed the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people, including 28 British soldiers and policemen.</p>

<p class="story">British intelligence also believed that Benjamin Emanuel may have been related to Vladimir Jabotinsky, a Russian Jew from Odessa who founded Irgun. </p>

<p class="story">Jabotinksy, who was an admirer of Benito Mussolini and who secretly negotiated for the expatriation of Jews to Palestine with the Nazi government in Germany and Admiral Miklos Horthy's pro-Nazi regime in Hungary, died of a heart attack in New York in 1940.</p>

<p class="story">Wikipedia deleted Benjamin Emanuel's entry in 2008*, shortly after Rahm Emanuel was designated as President Obama's chief of staff. Wikipedia is a favorite device for the perception management goals of Dr. Cass Sunstein, Obama's director of the White House Office of Regulatory Affairs.</p>

<p class="story">With a record of terrorist acts contained in his MI-6 files, Benjamin Emanuel was permitted by U.S. authorities to emigrate to Chicago from Israel in the 1950s, becoming a citizen. Rahm Emanuel was born in 1959.</p>

No they were trying to steal a country and ethnically cleanse it and are still doing so today.  By the way, you need to look at it from the correct perspective, the Jews of Palestine as they were then were fighting the British all through the WW11 due to an agreement made with Hitler to free 33,000 Wealthy, educated German Jews with all their assets in 1938 to go to Palestine. So in effect While the allies were fighting in Europe to free the Jews from Concentration Camps, the Jews of Palestine were fighting for Nazi Germany against the allies in Palestine.  His brother Ezekiel is also in charge of setting up "death panels" in the US when Healthcare takes effect.  The panels will decide which patients will be treated and which will not and they are using the same system as Nazi Germany. 
I would like to know why a Jewish War Criminal was allowed into America while other people from Europe were screened thoroughly in case they had said "boo" to a Jew during the war and extradited to stand trial.  They should still revoke his status and that of his sons for serving in a foriegn military, but not the American</p><hr />Francis February 1, 2011 7:25 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">I wonder if Rahm also thinks Arabs are only good for "cleaning floors".</p><hr />Anonymous February 1, 2011 6:57 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">The Children of Post WW2 Germany are still paying reparations for the war, yet Rahm should not be questioned about his father's involvement in the murder of Bernadotte, who saved 20000 people in WW2, half of them Jews? What if Hitler had a kid, could he be mayor of NYC illegally? No, the bullshitting Zionist only gets open minded about their own little sacred cows.</p><hr />Doug February 1, 2011 4:28 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Amanda's response simply underscores the old saying that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. If we are to accept or condone terrorism done by our "friends", then we cannot honestly condemn terrorism done by our "enemies".

Amanda's post also claims that the acts of the elder Emmanual were done under conditions of war. Israel was not a country at the time of the Irgun murders and bombings, and the targets were British soldiers and Swedish diplomats. So, were the Jews at war with the British and Swedes? And who exactly declared this "war"? Israel was not a nation, so was it declared by the World Jewish Congress or by one of the many other international Jewish organizations?

This also brings to mind the fact that the World Jewish Congress declared war on Germany in 1933, two weeks after the Nazis came to power. They declared war again on 3 Sep 1939, along with France and Britain. By declaring war on Germany, they made the Jewish people under German jurisdiction valid military targets, at least as valid as the people of Dresden or Hiroshima. Anything that may have happened to the Jews between 1933-1945 were a direct result of their own declaration of war.</p><hr />expat February 1, 2011 2:56 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">His mum was a airline hostess

He funded the Nazi German war machine which incidently killed many US GI's during WW2 if I'm not mistaken.  Of course his son and grandson went on to become US Presidents.  So maybe Rahm will be President soon.  I heard he was born in Hawaii the day after Obama.</p><hr />Anonymous January 27, 2011 4:52 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">It doesnt matter...the supreme court said rham can run for office, even tho it is strictly forbidden by law. If you dont know by now that the zionist bankers own this country, including most of congress/senate/president, you are living in a fantasy world. Unlike israel/zionists, I am against violence, I make videos now and then..here is my latest.
 Stayed up all night making this. WHile they kill, destroy, destruct, manipulate, brainwash, and lie, I am just a person who actually loves humanity, and I am sick and tired of the rothchilds/zionist/israel destruction of this plaent for their own good. But I dont shoot guns, I make videos. (amanda, you probably dont even know the rothchilds birthed the zionist cult, to move into the middle east, and financed both sides of WW2 do you? of course you dont, go back to your tv)

What did any of that have to do with the respect his son’s garnered? Nada. Innocent until proven guilty. You simply cannot judge a book by its cover.

E.J. O'Hare was Al Capone's lawyer.  E.J. had a son named Butch, who was the joy of his life.  As Butch moved into his teens, he dreamed of being a pilot.  He dreamed of an appointment to the Naval Academy at Annapolis.

But the U.S. government wouldn't give such an honor to the son of Al Capone's lawyer.  So E.J. made a deal.  He would give the feds the goods on Capone.  In return, his beloved Butch would get into Annapolis.

Well, Capone did get convicted of income tax evasion, in 1931.  A few years later, Butch did go to Annapolis, and graduated Class of 1937.  He became a pilot and a hero in World War II, earning the Medal of Honor.  He was later killed in another engagement. 

Today, Chicago's O'Hare Airport is named for him.
But E.J. could not revel in Butch's glory, nor mourn his passing.  In 1939, E.J. was gunned down on a Chicago street.  The Capone mob had learned of his betrayal.

At this point, the Irgun was simply keeping the pressure on using maybe intimidation to the U.S.) to follow through on some old pro-Zionist promises (from 1917 and 1922) endorsing to let the Jewish Diaspora set up in Palestine as 'rulers' if they behaved themselves (which they didn't/haven't). Some Irgun terrorists were given an asylum of sorts in the U.S.

The better question would be "Why?"

There is so much corruption in their government you culd cut it with a knife. His actions working with obama are from a mad man.  He is now breaking state law running for office, it will be interesting to see how corrupt the courts are, and if they bypass the law for good ol rahm.  Anyway, cool to see ya got Wayne Madsen to send an article. I hear him on the alex jones radio show now and then, seems to be a pretty good 'in the know' type guy. 
 And yeah Tim, watch out for that dead fish in the mail. </p><hr />carmen January 26, 2011 7:48 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">As a Chicagoan I'm impressed that someone is actually printing stories that draw questions of Rahm or his family. Damn right we need to know about this. MI-6 labeled his father a terrorist. Why can't we know about this? 
Good job Salem News. But don't be surprised if you get a dead fish in the mail.</p><hr />Amanda January 26, 2011 6:26 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments"><p>I think it is unfair to post a father&#39;s questionable deeds under conditions of war, or attempt to espose a son for his fathers acts under conditions of war.</p><p><strong>Editor: The man was/is a terrorist.&nbsp; If the shoe was on the other foot everyone would <em>scream </em>but the blatant prejudice of this nation allows people to condone the murderous deeds of the Israelis but instantly condemn those of the people whose land was stolen.&nbsp; Shall we make bin Laden&#39;s son the next chief of staff?&nbsp; Please note that this man belonged to a particular military group that killed a lot of British military personnel and other westerners.&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t just some stooge in the IOF. &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br /></p></p><a HREF="#top"><b>[Return to Top]</b></a>
