 <p class="story">(SALEM, Ore.) - I am not surprised that the number one thing Americans are asking President-elect Barack Obama is whether or not he is going to legalize marijuana.  Generations are changing and evolving and the taboos around cannabis are slowly falling away.  </p>

<p class="story"><img src='/gphotos/1229075487.jpg' align='left'>American industries can harness the power of this multi-billion dollar, still mostly black market business.  The attitude of people in this country is in a mode of great anticipation and change.  Barack Obama is already on the record saying he does not want to use the Justice Department to bust state operated medical marijuana dispensaries.  </p>

<p class="story">People submitting questions in this Online event seem to identify the legalization of medical marijuana and marijuana overall, as a top priority.</p>

<p class="story">I included the top ten and a link to the page that allows you to see all of the other questions that people seek to have answered by Barack Obama.</p>

<p class="story">Other hot topics are Wall Street, Stem Cell Research, and for a lack of better terms, retribution against the Bush Administration for things like illegal wiretapping and the authorization of torture.</p>

<p class="story">Since its launch Wednesday, the "Open for Questions" tool processed over 600,000 votes from more than 10,000 people on more than 7,300 questions.</p>

<p class="story">Voting came to a close Friday, December 12th, at 12:00 AM Eastern Time, so that the team can prepare answers to some of the most popular questions.</p>

<p class="story">Pilot projects like "Open for Questions" depend on feedback from users to better understand how to make participation intuitive and productive.</p>

<p class="story">Obama's team stated, "Participation in Open for Questions outpaced our expectations, and we're looking forward to rolling it out again next week. We're tremendously excited about the promise of tools like this that offer Americans a level of access that has historically been hard to come by."</p>

<p class="story">By voting questions up, users have been able to convey to the team which major issues -- including the auto industry, health care, ethical standards, and others -- are the most important to this community.</p>

<p class="story">As one of the only essentially mainstream news organizations Online that covers legal medical marijuana seriously, Salem-News.com has earned a worldwide and national reputation as the only Website that offers an experienced doctor who is an expert on the subject, for question and answer interviews based on visitor's questions.</p>

<p class="story">Dr. Phillip Leveque is a World War Two veteran and his education, background and experience in multiple specialties, places him among the most qualified doctors in the nation.  He writes from the perspective of an Osteopath, Pharmacologist and Toxicologist.  </p>

<p class="story">I am glad to see the value of this natural herb gaining acceptance for its potential value as a legal and taxable commodity, and we do not consider this as any kind of an underground or taboo subject when we report about it.  Medical marijuana is legal in Oregon and many other places, and the patients have very few places to turn.  We are glad to fill that void.    </p>

<p class="story">Over the next few days, some of the most popular questions selected by the <a href="http://www.change.gov">Change.gov</a> community will be answered by the Transition team, and their responses will be posted on their site.</p>

<p class="story"><b><font style='font-size:14px;'>The Questions Americans are Asking Barack Obama</font></b></p>

<p class="story">Currently in the lead: <i>"Will you consider legalizing marijuana so that the government can regulate it, tax it, put age limits on it, and create millions of new jobs and create a billion dollar industry right here in the U.S.?"</i><br>- <b>S. Man, Denton</b></p>

<p class="story">Second place question: <i>"What will you do as President to restore the Constitutional protections that have been subverted by the Bush Administration and how will you ensure that our system of checks and balances is renewed?"</i><br>- <b>Kari, Seattle</b></p>

<p class="story">Third place question: <i>"What will you do to establish transparency and safeguards against waste with the rest of the Wall Street bailout money?"</i><br>- <b>Diane, New Jersy</b></p>

<p class="story">Sixth place question: <i>"Will you lift the ban on Stem Cell research in your first 100 days in office?"</i><br>- <b>James_M, Nashville, TN</b></p>

<p class="story">Fifth place question: <i>"What will you do to promote science and mathematics education to Elementary and Middle School students?"</i><br>- <b>JasonWyatt, Raleigh, NC</b></p>

<p class="story">Sixth place question: <i>"Will you appoint a Special Prosecutor - ideally Patrick Fitzgerald - to independently investigate the gravest crimes of the Bush Administration, including torture and warrantless wiretapping?"</i><br>- <b>Bob Fertik, New York City</b></p>

<p class="story">Seventh place question: <i>"13 states have compassionate use programs for medial Marijuana, yet the federal gov't continues to prosecute sick and dying people. Isn't it time for the federal gov't to step out of the way and let doctors and families decide what is appropriate?"</i><br>- <b>Greg, Minnesota</b> </p>

<p class="story">Eighth place question: <i>"What do you plan to do to our food industry to make it more sustainable? Will there be changes to our farming policies?"</i><br>- <b>Jentry, Lincoln, NE</b></p>

<p class="story">Ninth place question: <i>"What will you do to end the use of mercenary forces (ie Blackwater) by our military?"</i><br>- <b>Betsie, Mtn Home, AR</b></p>

<p class="story">Tenth place question: <i>"What will you do first to reduce pollution/waste and incentivize greener behavior across the country?"</i><br>- <b>Diane, Boston, MA</b></p>

Marijuana is not a drug, a plant is all! I think this plant has kept a lot of peace on this earth. so smoketh, cougheth and passeth!! </p><hr />Mikey boi June 24, 2009 1:01 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">There are alot of federal and state laws that have different ways to regulate marijuana. The one that makes me the most angry, to curb black and mexican immigrant minorities in the south. The government knows mexicans and other low wage workers use the plant. I myself use it in order to sleep and relax at the end of a hot day.. why do u think the pen is all full up with hispanic and african american men. Do not get me wrong.. there are ALOT of illicit drugs on the street. many of them are incredibly unhealthy. Marijuana is not one of these substances.  
If People act up on alcohol.. they will be prosecuted.. Wh not setup the same rules for mary jane? why not harness the economic capabilities marijuana can provide as an industry? we can makep (clothing, rope, psuedo plastics, and other useful instruments); jobs and hope.. that i have yet to feel from the obama administration.</p><hr />janet June 19, 2009 11:09 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">it should be legal. alcohol is so much more dangerouse. what are they doing to stop prescriptions from getting sold. "oh you didn't test positive for pot but just keep taking your volume, oxycodnes, etc. thats ok."you know how much jail space and money we would be saving. This whole thing is just so the government can control (regulate) our lives more and waste money.</p><hr />Darick June 4, 2009 12:16 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Legalize it!</p><hr />teen May 7, 2009 1:24 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">ok so im supposed to be doing a debate paper for my law class. i have read MANY articles and looked at both sides and i must say that this could be an ok idea i dont know if i like it ,but im taking on the attitude of mr schwartzenegger(probably spelled wrong) and im open to a debate on such a thing. Mr. obama should understand that todays society and ideals are changing and as a blood born christian i dont know if all of them are acceptable, our society is changing and we need to recognize this like adults not the stubborn headed 5 year olds that politicians have become we need to have an honest and open to a debate. people are saying that marijuana is "the safe drug" and that studies have shown so. this is impossible every drug ever created by man or nature has some sort of negative effects. now that all of the sudden these colleges are coming out with 8 to 10 year studies of people they are watching who are taking marijuana. i dont know if i can believe that simply because ITS STILL ILLEGAL!!! they cant conduct a study on an illegal drug! but i must say the evidence is compelling. i will continue my research.</p><hr />Will April 26, 2009 8:42 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">I really think Obama did not consider the implications of his actions when he laughed at the question. He didn't consider that there are thousands of non-violent drug offenders who have been sentenced to a prison term because they were enjoying a bit of pot. He himself admitted that he has smoked before.. does that mean he should be in jail? I wish he would just have the courage to legalize it and help out all those families that are now broken because of an old scheme to save the lumber business from hemp. It must also be known that the activity or objects that are deemed illegal attract violent, criminal (of other sorts such as murder etc.) activity. A criminally minded person would have no interest in selling pot if it was illegal.. it would be like selling Tylenol.. and thus the rate of crime would diminish significantly.. Justice is meant to protect the people, not persecute them!!!</p><hr />Harley April 13, 2009 7:43 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">think about this would you rather two doors down from a child molestor or a person who smokes a joint a day!!</p><hr />Keith the vet from CA March 26, 2009 6:13 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">I think Obama should not laught about the legalization of Marijauna. I not only voted for him but I even call my congressmen and go above and beyond to support him. There are a lot of peoples live that are affected in a negitive way because people like him think it is a joke to legalize marijauna . How about the people patrolling the border ?I just heard they killed another U.S. marshall . I know the mojority of people in CA would like to see it legal and these are the people that rally for president Obama . So for him to act like that is not something that is on our minds will not get him more support. If it wasn't so many people would not have brought it up... and no I do not smoke the stuff myself! </p><hr />mike March 26, 2009 12:26 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">america is being seen as a dum a## becus we wont make a plant legal. 64% of the usa uses this plant. mi opinion is that weed is a plant it grouse in the ground if god didint wont it it wudint be around.im shor u wont it legal but your just wateing for the rest of the usa to like you mor.the only thing it dues is make u hungry,sleepy,happy.</p><hr />John David Hancock March 25, 2009 10:12 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">This war on marijuana is a big waste of us taxpayers hard earned money. Legalization would mean billion in annual profits that could go towards something worth fighting.. like the bigger drugs such as heroin and cocaine. I was recently arrested (3/19/09) by an officer for no reason whatsoever, i had just dropped off a friend and was leaving and turned a corner (using my blinker) and he was going the opposite direction, he turned his lights on and came up to my car opened my car door told me to get out and get on the ground and took the weed out of my door and cuffed me (i only had a quarter and a pipe) and now i'm facing over $2,000 in fines, but for what, smoking a little weed and enjoying life? To some people weed is just one of those things in life that make us happy as is sex and television. Do some research on marijuana and it's true facts instead of just hearing things and assuming they're correct here's a little webside i've found with some very interesting facts (http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/factsmyths/) Marijuana's dangers are very over rated and stoners are stereotyped as low lifes that do nothing but sit around and smoke pot! it's bull shit! why wont people freakin realize that you cant do anything as an individual in this crazed world "Adam Davis agrees" we live in, BUT UNITED WE ARE STRONG! We dont have to take this bull shit any longer, we're american citizens "the supposably land of the free" who's free here? in jail we aren't free are we? ... smoke a little weed and end up in jail, and all because we just wanted to be happy.. so i encourage you, do something about it and STICK IT TO "THE MAN"!! Support Assembly Bill 390, and start the revolution and one day maybe it will be legalized in all of the United States!</p><hr />Brandon Aguiar March 23, 2009 5:22 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Legalize what the lord has blessed us all with.. for I and so many will reach a sense of peace and our economy will be great..and oh yea you should regulate and tax it for all states along with a 18 or 21 age Plus..Legalizing this wonderful plant will stop violence and issue of trying to obtain it without breaking our country's law..Overall Hemp is great!</p><hr />Morpheus320 March 22, 2009 6:13 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">legalize it. cannabis is beautiful plant that i love</p><hr />cattellar March 21, 2009 7:42 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">To Mr. Obama: The people of your country have spoken, this IS an important subject, your nation want it to be legalized, if you dont listen to your people you are a dictator.

Perhaps its because we finally have a President, Barack Obama, who has a different prospective on this issue then his predecessors did. If cannabis was legal, we as a Nation would stimulate our ever decreasing economy. We would generate more then a billion dollars in tax revenues, each year. We would create thousands of new jobs throughout the country; be able to monitor our cannabis dispensary's and by doing so, we would ensure the cannabis was not being sprayed by harmful chemicals, or sold to minors under the age of 21. With over 60 million people using cannabis in the U.S. today, our laws and law makers should view it under the same-light as they do alcohol. No driving under the influence, no consumption in public, unless in an establishment designated for such consumption. This would also eliminate individuals from having to sneak into the dark corners of our communities, risking harm to themselves or worse. Studies have been done showing cannabis is not as harmful to our bodies as alcohol is. The following are statistics on Alcohol vs. Marijuana: 
1. Over 100 thousand deaths annually are directly linked to-acute alcohol 
poisoning. 
2. In 4,000 years of recorded history, no one has ever died from a pot overdose. 3. Alcohol causes physical and psychology dependence. 
4. Alcohol is reported to cause temporary and permanent damage to all major
organs of the body. 
5. Cannabis is a much less violent provoking substance than alcohol. 
Marijuana Status in 1970 11% of high school seniors said they were using marijuana everyday. In 1975 About 27% said they had used marijuana sometime in the previous month. In 1978 The monthly users grew up to 37% then in 1986 dropped to 23%. In 1979 12 to 17 year old reported using it within the last month has dropped from a high point of 17% and in 1987 dropped to 12%. It's smoke, doesn't it cause "cancer"? The truth is, it doesn't increase the risk of cancer enough to associate it as such a risk. Doesn't the constitution allow Doctors to distribute medication to their patients they feel would benefit them? Bring comfort to them? Cannabis helps relieve pain from chemo therapy, allow the patient to eat something. So why does the Government protest cannabis for medicinal purposes? Now we can get really into it and discuss how the government, through the CIA and DEA allowed drugs into our country. I think it was called Iran-contra! President Reagan, Oliver North.... ringing any bells? The drug war is not winnable, but it sure is findable. The Government doesn't appose drugs in our country, its keeping the politician funded and happy.
US Secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, was the CEO of a pharmaceutical Company. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar business, would it benefit these companies to legalize cannabis? Wake up America and educate yourselves to the facts. Politicians care about two things, getting re-elected and making money. If the American people speak out and refuse to re-elect these politicians who are on "the other side of the issue", you will see how fast they expedite getting on the "right side of the issues", with dancing shoes on.

Every year…
Can you IMAGINE how much weed that would produce?
Dude, In the prohibition, The reason they couldn’t control the Alcohol is b/c everybody had drank, (that drinks) before then. But, See when they Illegalized weed, NO BODY SMOKED IT! (except blacks and Mexicans) Who, at that time were just coming out of oppression. So there was no uprising. They had no power. But think if “all of a sudden weed was legal, lets say for a year, long enough for everybody to get the grow lights needed, and learn how to grow at their house. Actually make it two years its legal.(so people have time to start enjoying life with this new “Increased Awareness” of how much they’ve been lied to; sets in… then. Make it illegal again….
TRY TO STOP IT! 2 years! Im proposing the 2 year legalize plan.
To see what would change? The Government shouldn’t be scared right?
If what they say is true, they have nothing to worry about!
But what is “What they say?”… I mean, does the Government have anything to justify it?
What are they afraid will happen? …
People “Wake up”?
Seriously. If anyone has an answer please tell me! A Gateway? Cigarettes are a gateway!
If I got high right now, Sitting here in my house, in 2 weeks I still wouldn’t be able to get a job; yet, I could get flat on my face drunk drive home And Still get a job tomorrow!
I have a poster that says “Man made beer, God made grass…who do you trust?
Gorge Washington! For gods sake… we, (as Americans) think he’s pretty “KNOWLEDGABLE” right? (His face IS on the dollar bill)… 
Funny, He is quoted as saying “The hemp seed is good, Sew it EVERYWHERE!”
Americas economy was FOUNDED on hemp.
The constitution was written on hemp paper
Some say it makes you lazy, takes your motivation, OKAY!...
For every pothead that you show me that it “makes lazy” I’ll show you Two that it…”Gets motivated!” For instance, me, I’m high. That’s why I’m writing this.
It takes motivation to type this… Does it not? Okay. Point proven. That’s like alcohol.
Show me a low bottom alcoholic, I’ll show you 2 social drinkers that can “Take it or leave it” Give me those same alcoholics, The 12 steps of AA, and a FAT SACK of NUGS, And I’ll show you some “Recovering Alcoholics that won’t relapse.” 
The only reason people smoke so much is b/c “The Man” tells us we can’t.
And tells us not to. Actually, tells us “You better NOT!
If I put you in an all white room, w/ only a little tiny tiny window, and a red button on the wall. I sat you down and I said “Whatever  you do, Do Not push that button!
Something bad will happen….
Most people would sit there and never touch it. Never even think about it.
But some us, (anyone still reading this) … dare to question… It would drive us crazy.
EXpecially when everyone else in the room is talking shit about the guy that told you not to, and saying its fun to. Their pushing it, nothing bad is happening. If something does happen, its b/c the Man caught you pushin it. And he come in and spank you…. Meanwhile other people are pushing it to, all day everyday, but he doesn’t see them!
For some reason? What this letter is trying to do is get you RILED UP! Its time the people in this room, wait for THE MAN to come in and try and spank one of us, 
THAT’S WHEN WE JUMP HIM! Like in that book “Animal farm”
Its that fuckin time people. Can’t you see it? Its boiling right at the surface,
This uprising! We can do it! We need a leader… well, Hello! Im the leader!.
This is my SPEECH. I am gonna be the “martin luther king jr.” of the legalize marijuana movement! I don’t have an address. I don’t have a name.
But someday, streets will be named after ME! For my efforts toward this movement!
So now that you’ve read this, you know why it was sent to you! And here’s how it got to you… Since I’ve taken the time to write this, You can take the time copy paste it to a letter, and send it to EVERYBODY YOU KNOW that wants “IN” that’s tired of “The Mans” bullshit.(basically anybody that smokes, or HAS smoked) anybody That anit gonna wait until our freedom of speech is taken, before they choose to SPEAK OUT about how they want to live! That’s YOU! I know it is! See how many people we got already? 
See? We have to unite! Divided we are nothing. Together we’re unstoppable!
That’s why your reading this! If you choose not to… let me just say, that you are IPIDOMIZING the STEROTYPE of a stoner…
And YOU are the reason  WE PAY for it like its “something” reason its 5.00 for a GRAM of “garbage green” IT ANIT SHIT! Why am I paying 5 for it?
Well, I’m not. And your not either! (anymore). Im not gonna let you! If you close this or walk away.
And don’t do anything. Don’t send it to anybody… can I ask you something?
How worthless are you?
If you don’t stand for something you’ll fall for anything. TAKE ACTION!
All its gonna take is a spark. And this thing will BLOW! I’m telling you! ITS TIME! People. ITS TIME!. START THE REVOLUTION! JOIN ME!

Im gonna tell u all the truth... Marijuana is not a drug, its a f%$*n plant!<br />
Thats like saying that roses are illegal..WTF? Here are some facts:<br />
Does not cause cancer<br />
Does not kill brain cells<br />
Alcohol kills more than Heroin,Crack, and Cocaine combined annualy.<br />
Improves sexual life<br />
Positive reasons for using it<br />
Reveals peoples true personality<br />
Good for socializing<br />
Calms you down<br />
Used for thousands of purposes, all positive<br />
Safer than tobacco<br />
Does not kill or harm anyone it does the opposite<br />
Releives stress, which can increase heart risk<br />
Helathy medication<br />
<br />
So for these reasons i am all for legalizing marijuana, not only do i think we should legalize it, I think it should be  mandatory. <br />
For all those religious folks, saying marijuana is a drug is like saying god made a mistake, so u might want to think twice about calling marijuana a drug!<br />

The people laughed and said oh yeah, he means he can nigger rig it.  I disagree with this statement seeing as he is Arab.  Personally, that is the only reason he got as many votes as he did.  He played black, every negro in the nation votes for him not for his knowledge and expereance and values but his color and that alone.  We the people of The Northern States are hopeing to see you survive for more than a few months as president, we realy are.  But if you want to realy make a change it is going to take more than your skin color to impress your intentions upon the people.  We here in the Northern States believe that if you want to be the largest change maker in history YOU can achieve this in ONE easy step.  Legalize marijuana. If you do this you will be able to put tax on it, age limits and amount regulations.  Do yourself a favor and look up the original reason for delegalization of the plant.  It was uptight jackasses that had no knowledge of the plant.  Well you will find that out.  Anyhow, this poposal could do so much more than you can imagine.  YOU, Obama can fix the economy.  YOU, Obama can bring this country entirely out of debt to any other country.  Do you like owing them money or favors, NO.  I don't like the feelng that I owe sombody my hard earned money.  Obama, you could make these united states of embarrasment great once again.  Somthing no president has been able to achieve for so long.  You can be thought of by the people as a hero for stoping violence started over a once legal plant.  You do not have the right to tell mankind we can not have a plant.  It's a plant.  I know what your thinking, well so is cocain.  This is true however, it requires man to change it to be the DRUG we think of today.  Marijuana does not.  Think real hard and try to remember when the last time you saw sombody smoke a blunt or a bong or a bowl or a joint or any marijuana product rise to their feet and yell; "Lets go rob somebody!"?  NEVER.  It is a harmless plant that could change this country and the constant downhill economical landslide that your former presidents have left for you to attempt to repair.  Do you honestly believe there is any harm to be done?  Scientific tests prove that you pay more attention to the road when you smoke marijuana.  Unlike alcohol.  How many people die due to drunk drivers every year?  Way too many.  You need to legalize marijuana and crack down on drugs, NOT plants.  What idiot thought they where almighty and said ooo this is a bad plant, it should be illegal.  If it were not for them it would never have been illegal.  If you are worried about losing the support of the people who are against the plant then educate them.  Put them in a study.  Do not just say, "this is what I have been tought so it is what I believe.".  You and the people need educted on this subject.  You have heard not to judge a book by it's cover yet you do.  Learn the facts, Obama.  Take this country by the hand and lead them to greatness and individual wealth.  The profit this can bring is mass hemp product production, Hemp oil, pot browny mix, other recipies, maybe it could be used to make fuels, medicines, stimulate appetite, coffee, salads, many other things as well.  There is no sense in it remaining illegal.  Legalization could possibly give addicts to hard drugs a fallback product that will help them overcome addiction by stimulating the need for an escape from reality if used in larger quantities, without the worry of inprisonment or fines.  The bloodshed and inhumane crimes could be dropped by up to 90% or more.  You would make more room in the penatetaries for criminals, not conasures.  Think this over and do your research, it could benefeit you greatly as the nations elected leader.

I checked the most popular issues and legalization of marijuana had first place with 75000 votes, 7000 more than making the grid environmentally friendly, which was in second place. The best part about the topic is that its gaining over 1000 votes per day. I think I saw it gain about 1000 votes in just under a few hours yesterday. This is great. After his transition team shoots down the very idea of marijuana legalization, we the people of the united states shove the issue right back in his face. We're not gonna let this go until we end this silly war on drugs!

Just a few questions to help the cause.  You mentioned, and I quote, &quot;Barack Obama is already on the record saying he does not want to use the Justice Department to bust state operated medical marijuana dispensaries.&quot;  This is unquestionable true, however, this implies medical cannabis will be excepted on the federal level.  As you are aware, states like CA. disburse &quot;med-can&quot; cards.  But it is still illegal on the Federal level, for know.  But back to my thought, I am asking for the definition of &quot;decriminalization&quot; I herd Barack Obama say on a video, he advised he wanted to decriminalize cannabis, but not &quot;legalize&quot; it.  What do you think the benefit to &quot;decriminalization&quot; will be?  I am thinking citations, heavy fines or something on those lines.  I was curious on your thoughts.  Don&#39;t forget the court systems may still be involved in the above mentioned practices.  This will enrich the court systems with court casts, fines and so on. If it becomes a &quot;civil&quot; matter, there will be no jail time, but monetary awards can be obtained by the court system.  Just a thought, thanks for your time, Tony.</p><p><strong>Tim King: Tony, I look to the recent Supreme Court decision that ends local government&#39;s ability to interpret the law to fit their needs.&nbsp; I grew up in California where it has always been a simple ticket for possession of up to an ounce.&nbsp; I think the changes will be more gradual than we had hoped, but I think they will come. </strong><br /></p></p><hr />Deputy Tony January 1, 2009 3:41 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">I was reading some of your posted comments, as it relates to some other individuals thinking, and I felt compelled to wright yet again.  The term that concerns me is "gateway drug".  Does this mean every American who smoking cannabis, is on cocaine, crack or something else?  Hmmmm, interesting concept.  Does this mean the law makers who drink a beer, will drink then drink gray goose, and some day develop a liver disease and die?  If this was to happen, and it probably will, is beer not a gateway drug, at least by their definition?  When did tax paying citizens of this great Nation, which I proudly served for 10 years, become incapable of thinking for themselves?  I will look both way before crossing the street, I will stand up for the weak, I will pay my taxes and respect the elderly. I will smoke cannabis, but not crack.

Doctor's, under the constitution, can prescribe medications they feel will benefit their patients.  It does not mention which medications are, or are not appropriate.  It seems today we, as a nation, are relinquishing more and more rights given to us by our forefathers.  Not to drift too far off the subject, but we also have the right to bare arms.  Many States make it illegal.  Why did the forefathers do this?  Because they understood the Government was not perfect and if the day came the Government tried to take over its people, we would have the right to defend ourselves and protect the rights we have under the constitution.  Sure it applies to other countries invading us as well, but stay with me.  The legalization of cannabis is in the front lines, in my mind, as a right I am going to fight for.  The individuals on the "other side of the issue” are most certainly entitled to be.  But remember, 75%-80% of our nation is for it.  Hmmmm, then why the resistance?  In a word, Politicians.  Never forget the war on drugs is not winnable, but it is fund-able!  This is why I'm telling you all, to vote them out.  They are supposed to represent us, not themselves or special  interest groups.  Become pro-active and find out where these Politicians stand on the issues.  Trust me, when they see where the bread is being buttered, they will get on the right side of the issue.  They ONLY care about getting elected and making money.  Wake up America, before it's too late.

I happen to take several medications for Bi-Polar disorder, and the many pills I take are not 100% effective.  They can cause diabetes and other physical problems.  It has caused me many difficulties in my career.  As a teen, I have smoked Cannabis, and never have I displayed a "mood swing" disorder of any kind.  The drug company, Seroquel themselves, don't know how or to what degree their product works.  You see I do, medications are a multi-billion dollar business.  We are no longer talking about whats best for a patient, it all about the money.  We as a nation would be able to tax it, monitor it, i.e., ensure its not being sprayed with a harmful chemical.  We could maintain control, similar to alcohol.  You need to be 21, no driving and so on.  Please people get a clue, put away your fears and do the right thing.

There isn't a difference, except medical marijuana generally is higher quality because it's sold in store-front establishments, as opposed to paranoid weirdos in the back room of their parents house.  Marijuana should be legal for all.  Even though California has the best medical marijuana laws in the country, I still can't go down the street and get my medicine in a drive through Rite Aid pharmacy like everyone else does, instead I have to drive 30 miles or more one way to get my medicine.  It's really absurd the hoops medical marijuana patients are required to jump through to get a medicine that doesn't kill, when it's far easier to get a lethal pill from the same place you buy laundry detergent.</p><hr />peace to the weed December 27, 2008 3:00 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">you can die of tabacco and its legal,but you cant die off marijuana and THATS ILLEGAL.

I have been outraged over this subject since I read the constitution and looked around to see where out once great nation now stands. Not only should it be seen as purely corrupt that our government would see such a natural herb as an evil greater than alcohol, but moreover that our government would restrict its people from any non-violent action at all. It is a moral debate more than anything because (put simply) people don't want their children to think it is okay to smoke marijuana, however, I believe that what makes a man (in principle) is his ability to choose what he believes is right and what he believes is wrong. If America wants people to stop leaning on the government then let us take the fall for our own mistakes and learn through our own actions instead of slapping our wrist everytime we get out of line. The only thing that SHOULD be out of line are violent crimes and man made drugs. -HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT FORTH- Isn't Asprin more potentially deadly? Does marijuana contain ANY addictive chemicals like cigarettes? Why is marijuana worse than alcohol? Among its many other advantages, doesn't marijuana actually help with asthma? How many peoples rights have been lost because they choose this helpful healthy recreation? How many smokers have lost their jobs, can't get a job, or undermined the government by selling marijuana because they have no choice in todays strict American standard? Would it even be physically possible for the government to EVER stop human kind or mother nature from growing marijuana? Why doesn't the government restore our rights and pull itself out of debt at the same time by legalizing this helpful healthy herb? Even if the expensive suits will never look past the brainwashings of their previous generations, wouldn't the best way to stop extreme usage of marijuana be to legalize it so that it may be controlled in more of a way than it is by simply slapping convicions on todays youth for something that you cannot prove to be a justified wrong in any since of the word that might even apply to alocohol as well?

Of course special care must be given to make sure that minors don't get a hold of it.  Of course this issue has its share of political overtones, but the fact is that there is a huge market for marijuana that includes people of ever walk of life including all races and classes.

End prohibition on industrial hemp and it can save the world because it is the perfect, self-sustaining, drought-resisting, soil-renewing wonder plant that could immediately be grown, harvested and converted to biofuel and thus end our dangerous dependence on fossil fuels.

Marijuana prohibition violates the Ninth Amendment and is Unconstitutional and the President can instruct the Attoneys General in every state to not enforce marijuana prohibition until such time as the laws are repealed.</p><hr />Anthony NYC December 13, 2008 1:21 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">To the first two posters:

1) Correct we do have bigger things to think about now...like the fact that the country is running record deficits, record national debt, record incarceration rates and expediture, unemployment is rising above 6% in quite some time, and we're in two wars mostly over energy.  Sound about right?  

By legalizing, taxing and regulating marijuana and its cousin hemp we address, in a serious way, ALL of the above.

#2 - The president has a huge influence on what bills congress passes esp. as he has the power to veto them

If pot were legalized the disgusting tobacco industry could switch gears (Marlboro already owns the rights to the trademark of "Marley" brand smokes), the price would sharplyy drop with the increase in supply and ease of purchase (no more meeting the guy who sells much much more than pot in the alley to get your herb), and then right's crys of "If you make it cheaper then more people will do it and society will decline into reefer madness!" could be qwelled by pushing the price back up to black market levels with a heavy tax, say 25% on sale.  

As the DEA's own website states, MJ is the most commonly used illicit drug in the US so the revenue potential here is quite substantial.  

We could be talking about paying for Obama's entire national healthcare system and more just by dropping MJ's status as schedule 1 which defines it as having no medicinal properties whatsoever when overwhelming majorities of people and 12 states and dozens of peer reviewed studies suggest otherwise.

This is not one of our biggest concerns.  Not that I wouldn't enjoy smoking a fatty legally, but we have much bigger things to deal with on our plate right now.  I'm assuming about 75% of people that are supporting this are under the age of 30.  Grow up for now...</p><hr />Mr Liberty December 13, 2008 11:53 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">While I am for the de-criminalization/legalization of all drugs to eliminate their black market -- the fact that people are asking Barack Obama to legalize it shows how stupid the American public is.

The President doesn't make the laws.  He/she is charged with enforcing the laws.  Want laws changed?  Contact your Congressman/woman and Senators.</p><hr />Tom December 13, 2008 11:32 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Marijuana Revolution, I'm so down. </p><hr />Mohsin December 13, 2008 11:17 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Legalization Marijuana will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, something our country needs right now.

positive characteristics about them. I have not understood why one is legal and one it not.

It reflects those people who came to the website and had the time to vote. I doubt the sample of people that participated in this survey correctly reflects the population as a whole. I could be wrong. But even the questions are written from a very liberal stance. It would be hard to imagine somebody who does not have a liberal mindset voting on a question from a liberal stance. Its like asking a bunch of guys who are chosen based on their being attracted to red heads if a red head is prettier than a blond. Of course, if the girls are comparable to those indifferent to hair color, the guys who prefer the red heads will collectively claim the red head is more attractive. The only thing i see this article survey, and really this article reflecting is the ignorance of Americans. We are a nation together, not a nation individually. </p><hr />Response December 13, 2008 9:49 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">@AvangionQ In response to "How does the question about weed outweigh the educational or stem cell research questions?"

Look at how full our jails are with non-violent "offenders".  The pervasive crime associated with pot is not due to it's use, rather the black market that is enabled by it's illegality.

This affects every community from costs of jailing non-violent people, to a lack of focus on serious crime.  

Not to mention, jail time can ruin someone's future, education or not.</p><hr />new2site December 12, 2008 7:16 pm <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">of course, all of the above posts correct.  Phone calls/emails were 2000 to one in regards to stopping the  the bailout in Sept.  Keep that in mind when spreading your info.  And keep that in mind while the dwindling support in obama continues.  </p><hr />George December 13, 2008 9:34 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">While its interesting to hear what Obama has to say about this, its misleading to suggest this ended up a top question for any reason other than subterfuge. The link from the Digg website was misleadingly set to be the "vote yes" link -- not the link to the question itself, so thousands of people voted for it without knowing they were voting for it. </p><hr />AvangionQ December 13, 2008 9:09 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Impressive questions, one and all, and they will be a test of the Obama administration to facilitate the answers ...</p><hr />backslash December 13, 2008 8:33 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">How does the question about weed outweigh the educational or stem cell research questions?

This would be part of every other topic:  jobs, health, etc.  We need to know our neighbors and how to keep them from freezing or boiling.  CEO's would have to change, but their jobs would not be gone, since coordinating micro-grids so the down ones can help the up ones would still be necessary.  I am concerned that isolated people are now in unacceptable danger.  </p><hr />Ricky Grubb December 12, 2008 10:14 am <i>(Pacific time)</i><br /><p class="comments">Go to Change.gov and register, then search for all marijuana ideas and vote on all (for or against).
Contact your elected representitives, and the house (Nancy Pelosi)leadership, and request they;
 Please co-sponsor, support, and pass 3 important bills now in committee.
HR 1009 Ron Paul industrial Hemp.
HR 5842 and HR 5843 Barney Frank move Hemp to sched 2, end federal penalties for minor Hemp possession.
The federal listing of Hemp as sched 1 is way out of line for this benign and useful medicinal plant, and the war on Hemp is stifling American farm economy, industry, and human nutritional needs, while smoking Hemp flowers has become widespread, all legitimate economic and retail uses are effectively banned.
  Thousands of reasonable, and informed American citizens feel very passionate (as I do) this Hemp ban is purely corrupt, ill-conceived, and un-warranted government intrusion, and untold human suffering has been the result.
