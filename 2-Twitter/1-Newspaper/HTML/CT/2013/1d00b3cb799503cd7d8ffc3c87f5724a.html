                  <div class="commtext c00">If I were you, I'd look at what similar sites in other cities are doing.<p>A friend of mine started this: <a href="http://www.altdaily.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.altdaily.com/</a><p>They've been at it four years, and I know they've worked their butts off â€¦ and changed the model at least once. They've built huge influence in the community. I can get you in touch with them if it helps you idea-wise.<p>I heard the guy behind this site speak: <a href="http://rvanews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rvanews.com/</a><p>Sounded like a similar, lots-of-work situation. It was borne of a smaller blog network, if I'm right. But they've gotten a long way.<p>A thought on the site's design: I like Jux as a platform for secondary (read: special feature) stuff, but you're really hurting yourself by making it a primary platform. One, it's very difficult to throw ads in, and two, while it offers a lot of creativity, you will feel somewhat boxed in because a lot of the design decisions have already been made for you. You should be making those decisions yourself.<p>FWIW, I'm familiar with the platform, and got a good number of visits from an interview I did with BJ Mendelson a while back:  <a href="http://slides.shortformblog.com/465373" rel="nofollow">http://slides.shortformblog.com/465373</a><p>I did use ads in it, but I had to use some hacky techniques to embed them. (I also had to use hacky techniques to modify the CSS, but that's a different story.)<p>Also, understand your market: There are sites out there like Baristanet (<a href="http://www.baristanet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.baristanet.com/</a>) and the New Haven Independent (<a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newhavenindependent.org/</a>) that have been mining this model for nearly a decade, and doing it well.  Do your market research here, and see what they've done that's cool and interesting, and what can be easily translated to your model.<p>My suggestion: Don't be afraid to step back from this for a couple of months, work on the business model and start with a little more experience. It's way harder to get things moving without the business model already pre-considered.<p>Hope that helps!</div>
