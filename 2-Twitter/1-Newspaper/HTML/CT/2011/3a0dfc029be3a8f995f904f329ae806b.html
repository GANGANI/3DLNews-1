Exhibition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse works of area artists will be showcased in June exhibit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilton Library is pleased to present the diverse works of area artists in its June art exhibition “Disruptive Narratives,” opening on Friday, June 7 with a reception from 6 to 7:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition, curated by Tara Blackwell and Jahmane, invites viewers to explore the works of visionary artists using pop culture symbols and clever commentary to challenge societal norms, offering a fresh, critical perspective on the ordinary. The artists compel viewers to question the narratives shaping our world through satirical reinterpretations and subversive twists on familiar imagery. To encourage deeper exploration and discussion, each artist has selected a book that relates to their work and the themes addressed in the exhibit. These recommendations provide additional context and insights into the provocative topics explored by the artists. The artists are: 5iveFingaz (Norwalk), Tara Blackwell (Stamford), Lauren Clayton (Stamford), Dooley-O (New Haven), Alejandra Gonzalez Zertuche (Norwalk), Thalia Hernandez (Bridgeport), Jahmane (Norwalk), Lily Morgan (Stamford), and Sain&#x27;t Phifer (Norwalk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, “Disruptive Narratives: Teen Edition” celebrates the transformative power of youth creativity, offering a platform for the bold and fearless expressions of a new generation of artists. Join us in embracing the rebellious spirit of these emerging voices as they redefine the boundaries of contemporary discourse. The emerging teen artists are: Clara Eliot (Weston), Freya Goldenberg (New Canaan), Olive Goldenberg (New Canaan), and Lila Malone (Stamford). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artists will display their works in an array of styles, media choices, and subject matter. The opening reception on June 7 is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show&#x27;s curators, Tara Blackwell and Jahmane, are Connecticut-based artists known for their thought-provoking work that raises awareness of social issues. Together, they have curated a compelling exhibition featuring a diverse collection of talented Connecticut artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jahmane &lt;/strong&gt;began his art career in the form of &quot;graffiti&quot; and has evolved into a wide spectrum of mediums including works on canvas, photography, fashion design, mural painting, screen printing and graphic design. With years of formal training and experience as a studio artist, he has developed a unique style that combines social awareness, spirituality, mythology and abstract language into visually intriguing works of art. Channeling inspiration from past, present and future influences including vintage posters, zine culture, African-American quilt making, interior design, architecture and science fiction movies, his work exemplifies his passion to deconstruct popular norms and challenge cultural stereotypes. Instagram: @artofjahmane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tara Blackwell&lt;/strong&gt; is a mixed media pop artist based in Stamford, CT. Raised in a household of artists, Tara was immersed in differing artistic styles and modalities from a young age. Experimenting with a variety of mediums and techniques, Tara employs bold colors, layers, and texture, often incorporating nostalgic pop culture to explore contemporary social issues. In her work, Tara utilizes her advertising background to take us back to her childhood. Exploring vintage imagery with subversive wit and whimsy, Tara recreates familiar logos, packaging, and cartoon characters into a visual narrative of her youth as she transports us back to our own. At a glance, these paintings depict a childlike innocence, but there is usually underlying social commentary seen with a closer look. Instagram: @taramariebwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwalk native &lt;strong&gt;5iveFingaz&lt;/strong&gt; is dedicated to uplifting his community through art and kindness. Inspired by the compassion he received during high school, he established a scholarship fund for students demonstrating &quot;kindness, love, and leadership.&quot; 5iveFingaz is relentless in his mission to improve others’ lives. His works, often featuring precise phrases, provide a positive focus for many. Frequently, he gives his art away via social media scavenger hunts, making his pieces gifts to humanity, one person at a time. Influenced by artists like Dali, Kahlo, and Basquiat, 5iveFingaz aims to simplify truth and meaning in his work. His #LoveMoreThanEver Movement is a successful renewed translation of the peace and love messages from 60s rockers, especially John Lennon. Instagram: @5ivefingaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Clayton&lt;/strong&gt; is an artist, graphic designer and founder of Studio 162 based in Stamford, CT. She studied at the Cooper Union School of Art in NYC before launching her art and design business in 2003. Over the years, she has grown to offer a variety of creative solutions from brand identity to commissioned artwork and murals. In her intricate pencil drawings and collages, Lauren explores ideas of identity, connectivity, and our impact in our community and beyond. She enjoys using monochromatic palettes in her drawings and bold bright colors in her murals. She often weaves in words and symbolism inviting people to spend time getting closer and being curious. Instagram: @studio162design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary Connecticut rapper-producer-DJ &lt;strong&gt;Dooley-O&lt;/strong&gt; is widely recognized in DJ circles as the first in hip-hop to sample obscure 70&#x27;s band Skull Snaps&#x27; It&#x27;s A New Day and Producer of the underground Graffiti Videos called GTV (Graffiti TV). As a young street artist Dooley-O was not accepted in the art world so the streets became his gallery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram: @dooleyo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alejandra Gonzalez Zertuche&lt;/strong&gt; was born in Coahuila, Mexico, immigrated and resided in central Texas, until recently moving to the East Coast. Alejandra is a figurative painter who draws inspiration from her Mexican heritage and familial stories. She is currently a practicing artist in CT and an artist in residency at The Norwalk Art Space in Norwalk, CT. Instagram: @imale_z_art&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thalia Hernandez&lt;/strong&gt;, a Hispanic multidisciplinary artist of Puerto Rican descent, relies on nostalgia and intuition as the foundation for her paintings. Hernandez was raised in the Bronx and moved to Connecticut for her high school education. When living in the Bronx dance and music were the artist’s medium of choice, however towards the end of her high school career she expanded to the visual arts. The uprooting of her lifestyle and new exposure contribute to the feeling of displacement and ‘child-like’ seeking that show through in the work. Hernandez attended Pratt Institute graduating with a Bachelors in Fine Arts in 2019. Thalia has recently been showcased in Miami FL, Paris France, Brooklyn NY and Bridgeport CT. Over the last 2 years she has worked with Champion creating custom pieces for notable musicians during Coachella 2023. Instagram @&lt;a href=&quot;x.thalia&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;x.thalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lily Morgan&lt;/strong&gt; grew up in Fairfield County Connecticut and found her way back to the area in 2017 after attending Messiah College, where she earned a degree in Art Education. Lily now teaches art full-time at Darien High School and she finds that working with students in the classroom is constantly informing her own art practice. Her work explores the balance between impulse and intention as well as whimsy and weight. Most pieces begin with a bold color and a grid to provide structure for the piece. After those initial steps her paintings are built, layer by layer, and increase in complexity as they move towards the surface. Instagram: @&lt;a href=&quot;lily.morgan.art&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lily.morgan.art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sain&#x27;t Phifer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a self-taught artist who has the remarkable ability to transform simple concepts into meaningful, saturated pieces of art that awaken the consciousness. Driven by a deep passion for self-expression, Sain&#x27;t has found solace and healing through his artistic journey. Art became a powerful tool that helped him navigate and overcome personal struggles. He invites viewers to embark on a journey through his abstract and minimalistic work. Drawing inspiration from the likes of Basquiat and David Hammons, his visual creations transcend conventional boundaries, offering a unique visual experience that sparks imagination and introspection beyond the canvas. Through his artistic exploration, he captures the essence of his subjects, distilling them down to their core elements. Each brushstroke and color choice carries intention, inviting viewers to interpret and connect with the work on a personal level. Instagram: @saintphifer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;	To offer a fresh perspective on pressing social issues, the exhibit also features four emerging teen artists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Eliot&lt;/strong&gt;, a high school Junior, is based in Weston, CT. She is a multimedia artist primarily focused on painting. Clara’s pursuit of art was inspired by her early childhood in Los Angeles, her passion for animals, and her appreciation of graffiti. She is inspired by the work of Keith Haring and Banksy. Clara is interested in making the unseen, seen and on exposing life for what it is. As an emerging teen artist, Clara is still on a journey and loving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freya Goldenberg&lt;/strong&gt; relocated with her family in 2018, from London to Connecticut, and is now a Senior at New Canaan High School. Freya is aware of how important Mental Health is and has been a part of her school&#x27;s Mental Health Club for the last 3 years. She is passionate about women’s rights and an advocate for all women. Freya has worked at both the US Open and NY Fashion Week in 2022 and is now looking forward &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;to fulfilling her dream of studying fashion in New York City. But first she is off on an adventure in South East Asia, with her older sister, for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olive Goldenberg&lt;/strong&gt; is a social advocate, who has a passion for the fight for an equitable world. Olive is currently serving as an ambassador with the Pad Project, where she advocates for Menstrual Equity. Prior to becoming an Ambassador, Olive hosted a screening of the Award-winning film Period.

WHS science teachers nominate candidates for the award. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coleman, an AP environmental science student, won the scholarship for multiple reasons: She initiated and ran a successful book drive with her friend at school to reduce paper waste; she plans to pursue a career in environmental geoscience at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom (UK); and she participates in many other activities including school theater productions, Spanish Honors Society and ballet. She also works at the local British gift store in town called Penny Ha’Penny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Coleman was born in the UK, she looks forward to studying there next year. She knows the UK has made great progress in sustainability and wants to see firsthand if their methods could be applied to the US and the rest of the world. “No matter our race, gender, religion, orientation, or creed, we all need the Earth,” Coleman said. “If we don’t come together to change our lives to be more sustainable, the future will be disastrous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Marybeth Wheeler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dedicated conservationist, Mary Beth Wheeler had a special interest in preserving and propagating native flora. More than 1,000 plant species growing in and around Wilton that Wheeler and WGC members collected can be viewed at Yale University Herbarium at the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Wilton Library.

Experimenting with a variety of mediums and techniques, Tara employs bold colors, layers, and texture, often incorporating nostalgic pop culture to explore contemporary social issues. In her work, Tara utilizes her advertising background to take us back to her childhood. Exploring vintage imagery with subversive wit and whimsy, Tara recreates familiar logos, packaging, and cartoon characters into a visual narrative of her youth as she transports us back to our own. At a glance, these paintings depict a childlike innocence, but there is usually underlying social commentary seen with a closer look.

Influenced by artists like Dali, Kahlo, and Basquiat, 5iveFingaz aims to simplify truth and meaning in his work. His #LoveMoreThanEver Movement is a successful renewed translation of the peace and love messages from 60s rockers, especially John Lennon.

Hernandez was raised in the Bronx and moved to Connecticut for her high school education. When living in the Bronx dance and music were the artist’s medium of choice, however towards the end of her high school career she expanded to the visual arts. The uprooting of her lifestyle and new exposure contribute to the feeling of displacement and ‘child-like’ seeking that show through in the work. Hernandez attended Pratt Institute graduating with a Bachelors in Fine Arts in 2019. Thalia has recently been showcased in Miami FL, Paris France, Brooklyn NY and Bridgeport CT. Over the last 2 years she has worked with Champion creating custom pieces for notable musicians during Coachella 2023.

Lily now teaches art full-time at Darien High School and she finds that working with students in the classroom is constantly informing her own art practice. Her work explores the balance between impulse and intention as well as whimsy and weight. Most pieces begin with a bold color and a grid to provide structure for the piece. After those initial steps her paintings are built, layer by layer, and increase in complexity as they move towards the surface.
