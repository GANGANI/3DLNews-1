However, we have seen some recovery as temperatures pushed back into the 80s behind the departing storm system. At the same time, another area of storms is developing to our west and headed our way. This round will impact us in the middle of the night with more downpours and some gusty winds. The overall severe threat will be on the low side. Another quarter to half inch of rain is possible. There may be some lingering showers in the morning, but these should push out by midday with some sun possible. Temperatures will rise into the lower 80s. More storms develop during the afternoon and evening to our west Friday and Saturday, having some possible impacts on our weather later at night. We keep a chance for storms going into next week, but chances may be a little lower. Highs this weekend and early next week will be in the 80s to the lower 90s.

","longBio":"Chief Meteorologist Ken Johnson is originally from Mississippi but has been calling Texoma home since June of 2008. That’s when he joined the News Channel 6 team.\nHe got a degree in meteorology from Mississippi State University, and his first job right out of college was forecasting weather in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. Ken worked for WAPT for nine years before moving to Wichita Falls and News Channel 6. In his career, he has forecasted some big weather events, including Hurricane Katrina in 2006, the Christmas Eve Blizzard in 2009, a record-breaking heatwave and drought in 2011, and countless severe thunderstorms, tornados, and flood events. He enjoys the challenging forecast and witnessing the awesomeness of Mother Nature.\nWhen not at work, you'll most likely find Ken in a t-shirt and blue jeans cooking up something good to eat. His favorite thing to cook is smoked ribs or brisket. You'll see Ken post a lot of his meals on Facebook and Instagram.\nKen has a big family with three kids of his own, two stepkids, and his wife Kellie. He is a huge dog fan and has three: a chocolate lab, a golden retriever and a little pit mix that keeps him on his toes!\nYou may also find Ken on the lake. He LOVES to fish! His favorite lake is Possum Kingdom because of the hilly terrain and clear water. You may also find Ken in the deer blind in the fall or hunting turkeys in the spring.","instagram":"kenjohnsonweather"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:35:22.490Z","description":{"basic":"A large area of storms will impact us in the middle of the night once again!

FALLS, Texas (KAUZ) - Most of tonight into early Thursday should be void of many storms. However, another area of storms possibly lurking to our north could be down our Thursday morning our around mid-day with some rain and storm chances then. If those storms don’t gobble up all of the thunderstorm energy in the atmosphere, we could see more storms tomorrow night. IF we get those storms, heavy rain and gusty winds would be the main concern. We’ll keep off and on rain chances this weekend and early next week.

That’s when he joined the News Channel 6 team.\nHe got a degree in meteorology from Mississippi State University, and his first job right out of college was forecasting weather in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. Ken worked for WAPT for nine years before moving to Wichita Falls and News Channel 6. In his career, he has forecasted some big weather events, including Hurricane Katrina in 2006, the Christmas Eve Blizzard in 2009, a record-breaking heatwave and drought in 2011, and countless severe thunderstorms, tornados, and flood events. He enjoys the challenging forecast and witnessing the awesomeness of Mother Nature.\nWhen not at work, you'll most likely find Ken in a t-shirt and blue jeans cooking up something good to eat. His favorite thing to cook is smoked ribs or brisket. You'll see Ken post a lot of his meals on Facebook and Instagram.\nKen has a big family with three kids of his own, two stepkids, and his wife Kellie. He is a huge dog fan and has three: a chocolate lab, a golden retriever and a little pit mix that keeps him on his toes!\nYou may also find Ken on the lake. He LOVES to fish! His favorite lake is Possum Kingdom because of the hilly terrain and clear water.
