Still a junior in high school, he started there in 1989 as a tape operator for KYEL-TV. While the age of \"tape\" is long over, Gibby has evolved with the times. He became a photographer for KYEL and then moved to KOLD in Tucson after graduating from Yuma High School.\n\nHe moved to Phoenix to join 3TV as a photojournalist in 1994 -- he had just turned 21 -- and became an integral part of the station's flagship show, \"Good Morning Arizona.\" He's seen Arizona's Family through nearly three decades of growth and transformation, including the merger with CBS 5.\n\nWhile he's still working behind the camera, he's also in front of it just as much now as an on-air reporter for \"Good Morning Arizona\" on 3TV and CBS 5. Gibby covers everything from the day's breaking news to the fun, light-hearted features Arizona's Family loves to see.\n\n\"My mom said, 'If you love what you do, then you'll never work a day in your life.' I have not worked a day in my life,\" Gibby said on his 25th anniversary with Arizona's

Still a junior in high school, he started there in 1989 as a tape operator for KYEL-TV. While the age of \"tape\" is long over, Gibby has evolved with the times. He became a photographer for KYEL and then moved to KOLD in Tucson after graduating from Yuma High School.\n\nHe moved to Phoenix to join 3TV as a photojournalist in 1994 -- he had just turned 21 -- and became an integral part of the station's flagship show, \"Good Morning Arizona.\" He's seen Arizona's Family through nearly three decades of growth and transformation, including the merger with CBS 5.\n\nWhile he's still working behind the camera, he's also in front of it just as much now as an on-air reporter for \"Good Morning Arizona\" on 3TV and CBS 5. Gibby covers everything from the day's breaking news to the fun, light-hearted features Arizona's Family loves to see.\n\n\"My mom said, 'If you love what you do, then you'll never work a day in your life.' I have not worked a day in my life,\" Gibby said on his 25th anniversary with Arizona's

Go, Devils!\n\nBefore returning to the Valley of the Sun, Holly worked in El Paso, Texas, for three years as a one-man band multimedia journalist, weekend weather forecaster, and fill-in anchor.\n\nWhile in El Paso, Holly covered a wide range of stories. Some of her most memorable coverage includes the Aug. 3 Walmart mass shooting and presidential visits, including Vice President Kamala Harris’ first official visit to the southern border, alongside many stories regarding the border immigration crisis. In addition, Holly did an exclusive ride-along with the Border Patrol as thousands of migrants crossed into the United States from Mexico daily.\n\nHolly grew up in Los Angeles and loves the ocean more than anything. She is a big fan of country music and plans to attend ​all the concerts she can in Phoenix.\n\nHolly is looking forward to getting to know the community and helping them have a voice.\n\nWhen she’s not working, she’s enjoying the outdoors, at a country music concert or a sporting event (Go, Dodgers!). She also loves wakeboarding and snowboarding.\n\nHolly’s family is now split between Los Angeles, Lake Havasu City, and Flagstaff so being happy to be back in Arizona is an understatement.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kpho","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-05-28T02:50:35.860Z","role":"Reporter
