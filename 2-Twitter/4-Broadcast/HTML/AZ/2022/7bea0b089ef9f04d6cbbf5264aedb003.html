While studying for his undergraduate, he interned for Arizona PBS and Cronkite News. During both his internships, he was a broadcast borderlands reporter and focused on covering border-related stories in both Washington D.C., and Arizona.</p><br>\n<p>After graduation, Alex left the Valley of the Sun and headed to Texas. Alex was the Midland Bureau Reporter at our sister station CBS7 News in Odessa, Texas. While reporting in the Permian Basin his stories not only had a local impact but also national, when covering the mass shooting that happened in the area.</p>\n<p>Alex continued reporting on stories important to the West Texas communities as a multimedia journalist for The Connect Network T.V. a lifestyle show that aired in Midland, Odessa, and Austin, Texas. He focused on stories relating to the pandemic, specifically how Texans came together and helped each other with the then-new virus.</p><br>\n<p>Alex moved to Southeast Alabama and joined the WDHN news team as a reporter and producer in March of 2021. During his time working and living in Dothan, Ala, some of his favorite stories he covered included City Commission, the coronavirus, and severe weather storms.</p><br>\n<p>In his free time, Alex likes to spend time with his two fur babies, Oliver and León. In addition, you can also find him traveling and exploring everything the Old Pueblo has to offer!</p><br>\n<p>His hope now is to continue to give a voice to those who are unheard and continue telling stories important to the Southern Arizona community.</p><br>\n<br>\n<p>&bull; <strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:alex.valdez@kold.com\">alex.valdez@kold.com</a></P>\n<p>&bull;

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:
