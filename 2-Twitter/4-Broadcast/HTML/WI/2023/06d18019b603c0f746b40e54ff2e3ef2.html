Serving in the Minnesota National Guard during college, he was called to active duty to sandbag and stand watch over flood zones in the Fargo-Moorhead area during the major flooding event involving the Red River in the spring of 1997.\n\nHis interest in journalism began in middle school, when he started watching local news while growing up in Marble Falls, Texas. A TV reporter from Austin interviewed his dad for a story, giving Jason his first glimpse of the business. After moving to Minnesota in high school, he volunteered at a public access channel and graduated with a major in Mass Communications from St. Cloud State University.\n\nJason says he likes to cover the urgent news of the day. “Whatever people are talking about, that’s where I want to be.” But one of the stories he remembers best was a car break-in. A wedding photographer’s camera was stolen with all the photos of a recent wedding. “Amazingly, it was found one year later in the woods by a hiker far from the scene of the theft. The pictures were developed, and the bride was surprised beyond belief. They thought the photos were lost forever.”\n\nJason covers the Fox Valley, including Appleton, Oshkosh and Fond du Lac.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wbay","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"18","last_updated_date":"2022-12-16T15:28:17.096Z"}}},{"_id":"Chris Roth","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Chris Roth","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/3f5275d7-9447-43d7-9c93-f124dd5e6bf7.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Chris joined WBAY-TV as Sports Director in 1999.

In 2020, he also became the anchor of Action 2 News at 4:30.  Chris has been in front of the station’s award-winning coverage of the Green Bay Packers ever since, including Super Bowl XLV. In addition to anchoring sports for the 5, 6 and 10pm newscasts, he has hosted the WBAY’s Packers programs Monday Night Kickoff, Tuesday Night Touchback and now Cover 2, which is syndicated throughout the state and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Chris has won awards during this time from the Milwaukee Press Club, the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, the Midwest Broadcast Journalists Association, along with a regional Edward R. Murrow award.\n\nChris came to WBAY after four years with WISN-TV (ABC) in Milwaukee. As WISN’s primary beat reporter on the Green Bay Packers, he had the opportunity to cover both Super Bowl XXXI and XXXII. Milwaukee is also where Chris began his career, taking a job as a part-time editor and sports producer upon graduating from Marquette University.\n\nHis first on-air job came in La Crosse as a reporter, and eventually sports director. During his time there, he worked on the state broadcasts of the WIAA Boys and Girls State Basketball Tournaments\nChris considers himself fortunate to have covered a variety of major sporting events, from the Super Bowls to the MLB All-Star Game, the NBA Playoffs, and four PGA Championships. His one-on-one interviews with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods are two career highlights, though he has interviewed many other high-profile athletes (including, of course, Green Bay Packers players).\n\nChris has also freelanced as a play-by-play announcer. He was the radio and TV voice of the Green Bay Phoenix Men’s Basketball for several seasons, and spent a few years as the voice of the Packers Preseason Telecasts. In addition, Chris has called quite a bit of college basketball for Marquette’s television package and for ESPN Plus.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wbay","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"sports","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","last_updated_date":"2021-12-01T23:37:41.217Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T03:21:42.678Z","description":{"basic":"The

Serving in the Minnesota National Guard during college, he was called to active duty to sandbag and stand watch over flood zones in the Fargo-Moorhead area during the major flooding event involving the Red River in the spring of 1997.\n\nHis interest in journalism began in middle school, when he started watching local news while growing up in Marble Falls, Texas. A TV reporter from Austin interviewed his dad for a story, giving Jason his first glimpse of the business. After moving to Minnesota in high school, he volunteered at a public access channel and graduated with a major in Mass Communications from St. Cloud State University.\n\nJason says he likes to cover the urgent news of the day. “Whatever people are talking about, that’s where I want to be.” But one of the stories he remembers best was a car break-in. A wedding photographer’s camera was stolen with all the photos of a recent wedding. “Amazingly, it was found one year later in the woods by a hiker far from the scene of the theft.

In 2020, he also became the anchor of Action 2 News at 4:30.  Chris has been in front of the station’s award-winning coverage of the Green Bay Packers ever since, including Super Bowl XLV. In addition to anchoring sports for the 5, 6 and 10pm newscasts, he has hosted the WBAY’s Packers programs Monday Night Kickoff, Tuesday Night Touchback and now Cover 2, which is syndicated throughout the state and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Chris has won awards during this time from the Milwaukee Press Club, the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, the Midwest Broadcast Journalists Association, along with a regional Edward R. Murrow award.\n\nChris came to WBAY after four years with WISN-TV (ABC) in Milwaukee. As WISN’s primary beat reporter on the Green Bay Packers, he had the opportunity to cover both Super Bowl XXXI and XXXII. Milwaukee is also where Chris began his career, taking a job as a part-time editor and sports producer upon graduating from Marquette University.\n\nHis first on-air job came in La Crosse as a reporter, and eventually sports director. During his time there, he worked on the state broadcasts of the WIAA Boys and Girls State Basketball Tournaments\nChris considers himself fortunate to have covered a variety of major sporting events, from the Super Bowls to the MLB All-Star Game, the NBA Playoffs, and four PGA Championships. His one-on-one interviews with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods are two career highlights, though he has interviewed many other high-profile athletes (including, of course, Green Bay Packers players).\n\nChris has also freelanced as a play-by-play announcer. He was the radio and TV voice of the Green Bay Phoenix Men’s Basketball for several seasons, and spent a few years as the voice of the Packers Preseason Telecasts. In addition, Chris has called quite a bit of college basketball for Marquette’s television package and for ESPN Plus.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wbay","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"sports","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","last_updated_date":"2021-12-01T23:37:41.217Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T00:21:47.821Z","description":{"basic":"June

If there is a sports game on—whether it be the Badgers, Packers or Brewers—you will most likely find her yelling at the TV.\n\nAfter graduating from Algoma High School in 2007, Brittany went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for Journalism. After earning her degree in 2012, she became the morning producer at WKOW-TV in Madison. She says that’s where she truly learned what it means to be a journalist—and she has never looked back.\n\nBrittany went on to become a reporter and weekend anchor at WKBT-TV in La Crosse where she received multiple awards from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association for her investigative work and live on-scene reporting. She also won 1st place for an investigative report from the Midwest Broadcast Journalists Association in 2016.\n\nBrittany enjoyed her time in Madison and La Crosse, but she always knew she wanted to come back home and she is excited to join the WBAY-TV family.  It’s been a few year, but she is quickly remembering everything she loved about the Green Bay area.\n\nBrittany loves anything sports related, a good movie and hanging out with family and friends. She is hoping to add to her family by getting a puppy in the spring, so watch out for a cuteness overload of pictures on her Brittany Schmidt WBAY Facebook Page.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wbay","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-02-21T19:11:02.179Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T20:13:57.495Z","description":{"basic":"Detroit’s Police Chief says preparation is the key to security when hosting an NFL Draft.
