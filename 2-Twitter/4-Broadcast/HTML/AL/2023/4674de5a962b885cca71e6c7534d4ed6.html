Lee recalls it was a defining moment for the station.\n\n\"We did wall-to-wall coverage and stayed on air during the storm. This was a time when people needed life-saving information. It put into perspective what was important,\" said Lee. \"You also learned to appreciate the little things -- like running water and hot meals.\"\n\nWhile in Lake Charles, Lee also served as the station's weekend anchor. Lee says whether out in the field or on the desk, he was always there to tell the stories that mattered.\n\n\"That's always been important to me. My first news director was a tough critic, but at the end of the day she always wanted to hear a great story. I've never forgotten that and remind myself that's what I'm here to do -- tell great stories that impact viewers,\" said Lee.\n\nLee's work has been honored by the Louisiana Associated Press Broadcasters Association, including several first-place awards.\n\nWhen he's not at work you can find Lee exploring the Mobile area.

Emily is a Gautier, MS native, graduating from Gautier High School, home of the gators. She graduated from the University of Mississippi with a Bachelor’s in Political Science and a minor in Broadcast Journalism. Emily then decided to pursue a Master’s in Journalism and graduated from Ole Miss in May 2022. \n\nWhile in college, Emily worked for Newswatch Ole Miss as a sports anchor and correspondent. She also hosted various shows for Rebel Radio over the years including Her Playbook, Put Her In Coach, and Midday Music. SportsTalkMS’s Richard Cross told Emily there was no better time for women in sports then right now, so she dove in headfirst. Her love of sports led her to opportunities covering Ole Miss football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and more. Many days were spent on the sideline, in the camera well, or up in the press box. Emily followed Ole Miss baseball’s postseason run and attended the College World Series in July to cover the rebels for HottyToddyNews. She says it was one of the best experiences of her entire life. Hotty Toddy!!\n\nEmily is over the moon to be back on the coast. She says it is a dream come true to cover sports in the heart of SEC country. Emily also loves covering high school football along the Alabama Gulf Coast for First and 10. She’s proud to see all the young talent we have right here at home. \n\nWhen Emily is not covering sports for FOX10, she enjoys cooking, traveling, going out on the boat, spending time with family, friends, and her goldendoodle Charlie, and watching more sports!!\n\nIf you have any sport story ideas, please email

Her love for people and desire to share their stories is what propels her to be relatable, kind, and informative. Reporting for FOX10 is a dream come true for Ashlyn ever since she moved from her home in Hannibal, Missouri in 2018 to pursue an education at the University of Mobile in Mobile, Alabama. Ashlyn likes to say she is “Midwestern by birth, but Southern by heart.”\n \nIn 2018, Ashlyn discovered UM when she competed at the Distinguished Young Women National Competition in Mobile as the Distinguished Young Woman of Missouri. She quickly fell in love with the hospitality and genuine community of Mobile. Mobile made such an impression on her that she decided to attend UM only weeks before classes began her freshman year.\n \nAshlyn graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor of arts in communication and minors in French and government. With a passion for speaking and networking with others, Ashlyn has worked in many leadership capacities. Ashlyn worked at the Mark Twain Cave in her hometown of Hannibal, Missouri as a tour guide for four years. In high school, she earned several prose and oratory awards as well as being named Student of the Year her senior year. During her college career, she earned presidential scholastic awards, served as vice president of the UM Ambassador Program, interned for the marketing department, managed social media for the Student Life Office, volunteered as a Ram Rush Leader, and worked as a graduate assistant in Residential Life. Ashlyn also served as the communications coordinator for Redemption Church in Saraland, Alabama for a year.\n \nAshlyn is currently pursuing her master’s in leadership and communication from the University of Mobile in hopes of earning her PhD in communication studies one day.\n \nAshlyn currently serves as Miss University of Mobile 2022, a preliminary for Miss Alabama. She has developed her own nonprofit and social impact initiative, HeadBAND Together. This initiative focuses on fighting street harassment by equipping men and women with practical training to advocate for safety in public settings. When Ashlyn isn’t working or volunteering, she loves to spend her time writing, playing pickleball, and spending time with friends and family.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wala","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-16T15:56:49.971Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"20","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ashlynnicholsfox10news/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:34:14.985Z","description":{"basic":"Court

Now, Josh serves the community as an On Your Side Investigator. He hopes to be able to continue telling stories that make a difference. \n\nPrior to joining WBRC, Josh was a reporter with Bay News 9, the 24-hour non-stop breaking news cable channel in Tampa, Florida. Most recently, he covered the Seffner sinkhole that swallowed and killed a man while he slept, a story that made national and international headlines.\n\nJosh started his one-man-banding career with WJHG, the NBC affiliate in beautiful Panama City Beach, Florida. The most bizarre story he says he covered there was a man who chained himself to his outside power box to help save his daughter's life.\n\nAs an Alabama native, Josh grew up in the small city of Valley, Alabama. He graduated with a Broadcast Journalism degree from Troy University in 2007 and worked at the on campus station \"TrojanVision News\".\n\nOver the years, Josh's work has been recognized by the Florida Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, and also a portion of his work received an Emmy nomination as part of a team effort.\n\nJosh is an avid sports fan. One of his first jobs was shooting video of players for a minor league baseball team in Columbus, Georgia. He is an old school music fan (anything Motown) and is learning to speak Spanish.\n\n\"If you're around me for any given time, you'll hear me laugh a lot,\" Josh says about himself. \"An older gentleman once told me, ‘Son, laughter just makes your soul feel good!'\"","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"joshua-gauntt","source":{"source_id":"22857056"},"status":true,"twitter":"joshg_TV","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-06T19:11:21.052Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:35:05.216Z","description":{"basic":"Efforts

Lee, along with the rest of the news team, evacuated to a nearby hospital, where they stayed on air throughout the entire storm. Lee recalls it was a defining moment for the station.\n\n\"We did wall-to-wall coverage and stayed on air during the storm. This was a time when people needed life-saving information. It put into perspective what was important,\" said Lee. \"You also learned to appreciate the little things -- like running water and hot meals.\"\n\nWhile in Lake Charles, Lee also served as the station's weekend anchor. Lee says whether out in the field or on the desk, he was always there to tell the stories that mattered.\n\n\"That's always been important to me. My first news director was a tough critic, but at the end of the day she always wanted to hear a great story. I've never forgotten that and remind myself that's what I'm here to do -- tell great stories that impact viewers,\" said Lee.\n\nLee's work has been honored by the Louisiana Associated Press Broadcasters Association, including several first-place awards.\n\nWhen he's not at work you can find Lee exploring the Mobile area. He’s always looking for story ideas and looks forward to meeting the viewers.
