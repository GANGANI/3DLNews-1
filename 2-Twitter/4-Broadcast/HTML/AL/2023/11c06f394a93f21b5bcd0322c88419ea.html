Over the years, WBRC FOX6 News reporter Josh Gauntt has found himself on a few of those front lines telling stories of survival, heartache, and affecting change with government.\n\nJosh joined the WBRC FOX6 News team in July 2013 as a reporter covering Tuscaloosa and other parts of West Alabama. Now, Josh serves the community as an On Your Side Investigator. He hopes to be able to continue telling stories that make a difference. \n\nPrior to joining WBRC, Josh was a reporter with Bay News 9, the 24-hour non-stop breaking news cable channel in Tampa, Florida. Most recently, he covered the Seffner sinkhole that swallowed and killed a man while he slept, a story that made national and international headlines.\n\nJosh started his one-man-banding career with WJHG, the NBC affiliate in beautiful Panama City Beach, Florida. The most bizarre story he says he covered there was a man who chained himself to his outside power box to help save his daughter's life.\n\nAs an Alabama native, Josh grew up in the small city of Valley, Alabama. He graduated with a Broadcast Journalism degree from Troy University in 2007 and worked at the on campus station \"TrojanVision News\".\n\nOver the years, Josh's work has been recognized by the Florida Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, and also a portion of his work received an Emmy nomination as part of a team effort.\n\nJosh is an avid sports fan. One of his first jobs was shooting video of players for a minor league baseball team in Columbus, Georgia. He is an old school music fan (anything Motown) and is learning to speak Spanish.\n\n\"If you're around me for any given time, you'll hear me laugh a lot,\" Josh says about himself. \"An older

good!'\"","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"joshua-gauntt","source":{"source_id":"22857056"},"status":true,"twitter":"joshg_TV","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-06T19:11:21.052Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:33:59.892Z","description":{"basic":"With

Bryan spent the last 12 years as a one-man band. The industry terms it as MMJ short for multi-media journalist. Bryan considers himself a storyteller at heart.\n\nBryan graduated from Mississippi University for Women, and yes, you read that correctly! There is quite a story behind the enrollment of men in the early 1980s and one that involved the U.S. Supreme Court. We’ll save that story for another day. Bryan has been married to his wife DiDi Henry for more than 30 years with a daughter Laura Grace Henry who is enrolled at the University of Alabama.\n\nBryan will be WBRC’s reporter in the Tuscaloosa

green-thumber.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"type":"author","last_updated_date":"2021-11-12T00:07:35.036Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T01:14:35.728Z","description":{"basic":"Pastor

Bryan considers himself a storyteller at heart.\n\nBryan graduated from Mississippi University for Women, and yes, you read that correctly! There is quite a story behind the enrollment of men in the early 1980s and one that involved the U.S. Supreme Court. We’ll save that story for another day. Bryan has been married to his wife DiDi Henry for more than 30 years with a daughter Laura Grace Henry who is enrolled at the University of Alabama.\n\nBryan will be WBRC’s reporter in the Tuscaloosa

She is an anchor and on the 6 On Your Side Investigates team.\n\nTwo days after graduating from college, Morgan Hightower began her journalism career in Montgomery, Alabama. Nearly a decade and a few other jobs later, she is proud to be back in Alabama.\n\nWhile in Montgomery, Morgan was part of a team that built the newsroom at the ABC affiliate. She was involved in all areas of the newscast, from shooting, writing and editing all her stories, to producing and hosting. Being part of a small team meant that Morgan had the opportunity to cover several big stories, including a federal corruption trial, the State House and most memorably, the deadly tornado outbreak in April 2011. She shared the stories of countless people rebuilding their lives, followed recovery efforts and tracked down lost FEMA payments.\n\nFrom Montgomery, Morgan moved to Greensboro, North Carolina and worked at the CBS affiliate for five years as a reporter, later promoted to an anchor. While proud of the investigative work she did tracking taxpayer money and holding the powerful accountable, she will never forget the chance she had to cover the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Bedford, Virginia. Morgan rode a bus with dozens of World War II veterans, sharing the stories of how they saved the world. Her station earned an EMMY for its coverage of that memorable day.\n\n\nMorgan has worked as an anchor and reporter in Nashville, Tennessee. She covered crime, corruption and politics. The stories that will have a lasting impact are the heartbreaking mass shootings at a church and Waffle House in Antioch. She anchored for several hours on the days of the tragedies and followed both stories for months, covering the criminal investigations and court cases.\n\nBorn and raised in Orlando, Florida, Morgan is a graduate of the University of Florida, but she appreciates the Auburn/Alabama rivalry! She and her husband feel truly blessed to be back in Alabama, the place they met, got married and will now raise their family. They have a young son and daughter. \n\nIf you have any story ideas for Morgan, please feel free to email her at

Over the years, WBRC FOX6 News reporter Josh Gauntt has found himself on a few of those front lines telling stories of survival, heartache, and affecting change with government.\n\nJosh joined the WBRC FOX6 News team in July 2013 as a reporter covering Tuscaloosa and other parts of West Alabama. Now, Josh serves the community as an On Your Side Investigator. He hopes to be able to continue telling stories that make a difference. \n\nPrior to joining WBRC, Josh was a reporter with Bay News 9, the 24-hour non-stop breaking news cable channel in Tampa, Florida. Most recently, he covered the Seffner sinkhole that swallowed and killed a man while he slept, a story that made national and international headlines.\n\nJosh started his one-man-banding career with WJHG, the NBC affiliate in beautiful Panama City Beach, Florida. The most bizarre story he says he covered there was a man who chained himself to his outside power box to help save his daughter's life.\n\nAs an Alabama native, Josh grew up in the small city of Valley, Alabama. He graduated with a Broadcast Journalism degree from Troy University in 2007 and worked at the on campus station \"TrojanVision News\".\n\nOver the years, Josh's work has been recognized by the Florida Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, and also a portion of his work received an Emmy nomination as part of a team effort.\n\nJosh is an avid sports fan. One of his first jobs was shooting video of players for a minor league baseball team in Columbus, Georgia. He is an old school music fan (anything Motown) and is learning to speak Spanish.\n\n\"If you're around me for any given time, you'll hear me laugh a lot,\" Josh says about himself. \"An older gentleman once told me, ‘Son, laughter just makes your soul feel good!'\"","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"joshua-gauntt","source":{"source_id":"22857056"},"status":true,"twitter":"joshg_TV","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-06T19:11:21.052Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:35:05.216Z","description":{"basic":"Efforts

As a multi-media journalist/reporter, she is excited to tell the stories of the people of central Alabama.\n\nGrowing up in Pittsburgh, the hustle and bustle of the Steel City inspired Gillian to pursue a career in news. Country Roads took her home where she earned her degree in Broadcast Journalism from the Reed College of Media at West Virginia University. Before graduating, Gillian was the main anchor and medical reporter for WVU News, interned with West Virginia Public Broadcasting, and WTOV-TV, and worked in Walt Disney World.\n\nBefore coming to Birmingham, Gillian spent two years in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She covered everything from breaking news to historic weather events to feature stories. She also had the opportunity to anchor when needed. In addition, Gillian spent a year working on a series titled ‘Addicted Iowa’ where she shared the stories of substance use disorders and resources available across the Hawkeye State. Gillian is grateful for the experiences she had and the people she met while in eastern Iowa.\n\nWhen she is not running around with a camera, you can find her either in the kitchen baking something sweet, on a bike ride, or spending time with her family and friends.\n\nIf you have a story idea, please reach out to Gillian on social media or email her at gillian.brooks@wbrc.com.","slug":"","instagram":"@gillianbnews","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"type":"author","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2022-07-19T21:32:16.105Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T17:37:35.898Z","description":{"basic":"For
