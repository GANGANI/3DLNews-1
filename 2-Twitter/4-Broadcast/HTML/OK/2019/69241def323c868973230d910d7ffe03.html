Today, and every day through April, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum is remembering one of the victims.","socialType":"WEB"}],"validPackageTypes":["GALLERY","STORY","VIDEO"],"canonicalUrl":"/oklahoma-city-bombing-168-days-of-remembrance","canonicalUrlOverride":null,"pageTitle":"OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING: 168 Days of Remembrance","dateLine":"","byLine":"KTUL staff","lastUpdateUsername":null,"suggestedPriority":null,"topStoryPriority":null,"videos":[{"type":"Video","uuid":"54aee23c-7f0a-4f4d-8dc2-7ad9e90ba1f0","title":"KTUL -  OKC bombing remembrance","updatedBy":"Saundra Adams","created":1587354687000,"version":1,"externalId":"56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90","versionSetUuid":"a8478941-e86d-4847-b9bb-6b37c08c3801","alt":"KTUL","original":"false","orderNumber":1,"brandUuid":"a3e739cf-be62-41a0-a101-568ac2c1b66b","brandUuidList":["eeeda7fe-d744-4fd2-8aa8-264df662f6a6"],"duration":157,"thumbUrl":"/resources/media2/16x9/full/1015/center/80/389f6c1a-f7a5-4376-900a-2fb43d258855-large16x9_OklahomaCityNationalMemorial.jpg","url":"https://content.uplynk.com/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90.m3u8?tc=1&exp=1717152011&rn=769937134&ct=a&cid=56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90&hlsver=7&sig=1efcb86f45361c735bd603d79e4029bfc57e4ced6e49deca0a02ed4856fd7a90","mp4Url":"http://x-default-stgec.uplynk.com/ausw/slices/562/34d28c6069b34f1d96307c80809697d7/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90_g.mp4"}],"audios":[],"pdf":[],"sinclairOwned":false,"sourceTag":{"uuid":"2e63c649-21ab-44df-9b75-014f3152d359","name":"KTUL","dimension":"Source","removable":false,"weight":1,"userGenerated":false},"marketTag":null,"tags":[{"uuid":"6de4b9e2-9c24-4bc0-9e87-fb2d1454ffb7","name":"ALBUQUERQUE","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"4456729d-1577-45b1-8676-216b3e01382e","name":"Albuquerque,New Mexico,United States","dimension":"Disambiguation","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"9145f76d-9391-4889-95be-aec75d4ff56d","name":"Allen Wade","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"bbe9cf9a-ce33-4a21-97dc-497c5d5b6529","name":"Anthony Christopher Cooper II","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"3ba44729-f5c5-4a77-ada5-ae824ae41eb3","name":"Anthony Cooper","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"08d37c3d-6259-4801-a6e2-7cf48f5b3262","name":"Antonio \"Tony\" C.

Today, and every day through April, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum is remembering one of the victims."],"medium":["news"],"twitter:creator":["336596450513391617"],"image_src":["/resources/media/389f6c1a-f7a5-4376-900a-2fb43d258855-small16x9_OklahomaCityNationalMemorial.jpg?1572924745975","/resources/media/389f6c1a-f7a5-4376-900a-2fb43d258855-small16x9_OklahomaCityNationalMemorial.jpg?1572924745975"],"article:publisher":["https://www.facebook.com/NewsChannel8Tulsa/"],"twitter:image":"https://ktul.com/resources/media/389f6c1a-f7a5-4376-900a-2fb43d258855-large16x9_OklahomaCityNationalMemorial.jpg?1572924745584","article:tag":["jerrel","avillanoza","anthony christopher cooper","colorado,united states","thomas hawthorne jr.","mary hill","linda lekawski","teresa antionette alexander","denver","fred anderson","jordan elizabeth","austin,arkansas,united states","randolph a. guzman usmc","sharon coyne","carrie ann lenz","cooper jr.was","ronald vernon harding sr.","alan%20g","%","rachael harrold","james a. mccarthy ii","castine brooks hearn deveroux","kathryn","vietnam","dominique ravae (johnson)","alan g. whicher","treanors","james k. martin","michael howard","charles ?chuck? h. stratton","randolph a. guzman","moore","jamie genzer","renee cooper","andrea lewis thomas","clarence eugene wilson sr.","gloria eaves","kylie","claudine ritter","tashanna","ethel griffinwhowas","mozelle bibb","new mexico,united states","scott","colton wade smith","terry s. rees","u.s. department of transportation","katherine","city of del rio, texas","frances","u.s. department of housing and urban development","larue treanor","south dakota,united states","johnny allen wade","rosslyn","london","paul%20d","terry smith rees","honolulu","blake ryan kennedy","london,greater london,united kingdom","gary","karan howell","jo worton","margaret","robert lee luster jr.","justin","timothy mcveigh","watertown,south dakota,united states","carole sue khalil","pam","john albert","paul d. ice","tylor santoi eaves","cynthia lynn","louisiana","john a. youngblood","mary anne","susan","victoria j. texter","michelle a. reeder","rheta bender","cheryl","janet walker","claude medearis","germany","donald ray leonard","alvin j. justeswho","george edward thompson","thompson eugene gene hodges jr.","benjamin","william stephen williams","houston","linda louise florencewho","john karl van ess iii","oldaaron coverdale","bruce","dora reyes","virginia m. thompson","carrol june","theodore m. allen","haiti","raymond","charlotte andrea lewis thomas","carlos johnson","walker jr","scott coyne","michael","henry","u.s. housing recovery fund","lonny chesnut","elijah s. coverdale","dyncorp llc","los angeles times","new orleans","j. colleen guiles","chastity pope","julie marie welch","dana cooper","doris","larry l. turner","durant","richard a. allen","ricky","deb doges","karen johnson","donald earl burns sr.","florence rogers","william","nikki williams","allen wade","claudette duke meek","kathy lynn seidl","denver,colorado,united states","corey","burns","victoria","chris rosas","warren vieth","woodrow clifford \"woody\" bradywho","lafayette","shelly bland","jaci rae coyne.jaci","gabreon deshawn lee bruce","curry","new orleans,louisiana,louisiana","phil","derwin w. miller","tulsa,oklahoma,united states","amber denise huff","ernestine looney","paul gregory beatty broxterman","united states department of agriculture","linda gayle mckinney","christopher","karen gist carrwho","chelsea","kathy cagle leinen","visa inc.","richeal thatcher","u.s. department of agriculture","elizabeth ridley","janet battle","luther h. treanor","antonio \"tony\" c. reyes","local","lhasa","pamela cleveland","austin","jean mcraven","steve","oldrobert n. chipman","jd sports fashion plc","kyle genzer","robert n. walker","tuttle","mark a. bolte","amber denise","raymond hamilton","brad treanor","tony\" c. reyes","katherine \"kathy\" louise","houston,texas,united states","burl bloomerwho","jules a. valdez","dawn mahan","teddy","deveroux","kathy","john%20a","andrew e. thomas","u.s. army","deniece bell","betsy j.

Today, and every day through April, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum is remembering one of the victims.","socialType":"WEB"}],"validPackageTypes":["GALLERY","STORY","VIDEO"],"canonicalUrl":"/oklahoma-city-bombing-168-days-of-remembrance","canonicalUrlOverride":null,"pageTitle":"OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING: 168 Days of Remembrance","dateLine":"","byLine":"KTUL staff","lastUpdateUsername":null,"suggestedPriority":null,"topStoryPriority":null,"videos":[{"type":"Video","uuid":"54aee23c-7f0a-4f4d-8dc2-7ad9e90ba1f0","title":"KTUL -  OKC bombing remembrance","updatedBy":"Saundra Adams","created":1587354687000,"version":1,"externalId":"56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90","versionSetUuid":"a8478941-e86d-4847-b9bb-6b37c08c3801","alt":"KTUL","original":"false","orderNumber":1,"brandUuid":"a3e739cf-be62-41a0-a101-568ac2c1b66b","brandUuidList":["eeeda7fe-d744-4fd2-8aa8-264df662f6a6"],"duration":157,"thumbUrl":"/resources/media2/16x9/full/1015/center/80/389f6c1a-f7a5-4376-900a-2fb43d258855-large16x9_OklahomaCityNationalMemorial.jpg","url":"https://content.uplynk.com/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90.m3u8?tc=1&exp=1717152011&rn=769937134&ct=a&cid=56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90&hlsver=7&sig=1efcb86f45361c735bd603d79e4029bfc57e4ced6e49deca0a02ed4856fd7a90","mp4Url":"http://x-default-stgec.uplynk.com/ausw/slices/562/34d28c6069b34f1d96307c80809697d7/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90/56234592f4264a58908cc6f570159d90_g.mp4"}],"audios":[],"pdf":[],"sinclairOwned":false,"sourceTag":{"uuid":"2e63c649-21ab-44df-9b75-014f3152d359","name":"KTUL","dimension":"Source","removable":false,"weight":1,"userGenerated":false},"marketTag":null,"tags":[{"uuid":"6de4b9e2-9c24-4bc0-9e87-fb2d1454ffb7","name":"ALBUQUERQUE","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"4456729d-1577-45b1-8676-216b3e01382e","name":"Albuquerque,New Mexico,United States","dimension":"Disambiguation","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"9145f76d-9391-4889-95be-aec75d4ff56d","name":"Allen Wade","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"bbe9cf9a-ce33-4a21-97dc-497c5d5b6529","name":"Anthony Christopher Cooper II","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"3ba44729-f5c5-4a77-ada5-ae824ae41eb3","name":"Anthony Cooper","dimension":"Entity","removable":true,"weight":0.99,"userGenerated":false,"source":"CALAIS"},{"uuid":"08d37c3d-6259-4801-a6e2-7cf48f5b3262","name":"Antonio \"Tony\" C.
