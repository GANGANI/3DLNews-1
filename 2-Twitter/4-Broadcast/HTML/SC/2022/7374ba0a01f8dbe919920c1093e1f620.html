Growing up, I was terrified of thunderstorms and tornadoes, which peaked my fascination into wanting to learn as much about them and how they formed as possible. I decided to create my own tornado in a jar for my science fair project and began to read more on weather. I remember discovering that you could understand and forecast the weather.\n\nSince then, weather has been my passion. I grew up watching Kevin Harned in Louisville, Kentucky at WAVE 3. At the time, Kevin was the one who kept me calm during the storms. I loved how he would always tell you what to expect, when to expect it, and talk me through the entire situation. I had the opportunity to shadow Kevin Harned throughout middle and high school. It was during those mentoring sessions I knew that this career was something I wanted to do. I graduated from Spencer County High School in Taylorsville, Kentucky (28 miles from Louisville) in 2011.\n\nFrom high school, I took my journey to Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green where I absorbed all I could about weather. I worked at the WKU Storm Team, worked on a research project which we presented at the AMS conference on the March 2, 2012 Eastern Kentucky tornado outbreak and I was fortunate enough to land my first job at WNKY on their weather team while continuing my pursuit of a degree. I worked at WNKY for two years. During my time at WKU, I was blessed to meet John Gordon of the National Weather Service in Louisville and spent a summer interning with his office as well. As I said, Weather is my passion. I graduated from Western Kentucky University May 2016. Go Tops! I moved from Bowling Green, Kentucky to Hazard, Kentucky to become the evening meteorologist at WYMT. After a year of being in the mountains, I was promoted to Chief Meteorologist where I served as the leader for the WYMT Weather Team until April 2019.\n\nI am excited to join the First Alert Weather Team here at WMBF. I’m eager to learn from Jamie, Sean and Robert. I’m also excited to get out in the community and meet each of you. When I’m not at work, I enjoy being outdoors, listening to music, playing guitar, going to concerts (I LOVE LIVE MUSIC), and watching sports. I’m a huge Pittsburgh fan. I’m in love with dogs and have two myself named Cutch after former Pittsburgh Pirate Center fielder, Andrew McCutchen and Crosby, named after Pittsburgh Penguins player Sidney Crosby. If you ever see me out in the community, please feel free to stop me and say hello. I want to get to know as many viewers as possible.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Meteorologist","slug":"","status":true,"type":"author","last_updated_date":"2021-09-09T02:52:35.330Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T11:51:58.144Z","description":{"basic":"The

WRNN-TV(Rye Brook, NY) Producer \nNews Philosophy: Information can be more powerful than anything else in this world and no one understands that better than the journalists who pursue it every day. We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

The passion for all things weather sent Jamie to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he majored in both atmospheric science and geography.  The need to know even more about weather led him to further his education at UNC-Charlotte with a master's degree focusing on severe storm forecasting and lightning in the Carolinas. Several internships at local TV stations in Charlotte added an extra dimension to Jamie's enthusiasm for weather - the need to share that enthusiasm with the television audience.  The first step in that process was his first job as a weather producer at the NBC affiliate in Charlotte.  There he learned the ropes of the television weather business and honed his skills as an eventual television meteorologist. Jamie's first on air gig came at the NBC affiliate covering the Greenville/Washington/New Bern area of North Carolina.  With that on-air job came a lot of first-hand experience in covering the worst weather the Carolinas have to offer.  In his six years there, Jamie covered several tornado outbreaks and even a few snow storms, but it was the experience he received covering four land-falling hurricanes and six tropical storms that Jamie is most proud of.  That experience will serve WMBF viewers well when the next storm comes calling. When he's not watching the weather Jamie enjoys spending time with family, working in the yard, cooking and of course, hanging out at the beach. In 2011, Jamie was awarded the Best Weathercast by the South Carolina Associated Press.

The passion for all things weather sent Jamie to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he majored in both atmospheric science and geography.  The need to know even more about weather led him to further his education at UNC-Charlotte with a master's degree focusing on severe storm forecasting and lightning in the Carolinas. Several internships at local TV stations in Charlotte added an extra dimension to Jamie's enthusiasm for weather - the need to share that enthusiasm with the television audience.  The first step in that process was his first job as a weather producer at the NBC affiliate in Charlotte.  There he learned the ropes of the television weather business and honed his skills as an eventual television meteorologist. Jamie's first on air gig came at the NBC affiliate covering the Greenville/Washington/New Bern area of North Carolina.  With that on-air job came a lot of first-hand experience in covering the worst weather the Carolinas have to offer.  In his six years there, Jamie covered several tornado outbreaks and even a few snow storms, but it was the experience he received covering four land-falling hurricanes and six tropical storms that Jamie is most proud of.  That experience will serve WMBF viewers well when the next storm comes calling. When he's not watching the weather Jamie enjoys spending time with family, working in the yard, cooking and of course, hanging out at the beach. In 2011, Jamie was awarded the Best Weathercast by the South Carolina Associated Press.

Growing up, I was terrified of thunderstorms and tornadoes, which peaked my fascination into wanting to learn as much about them and how they formed as possible. I decided to create my own tornado in a jar for my science fair project and began to read more on weather. I remember discovering that you could understand and forecast the weather.\n\nSince then, weather has been my passion. I grew up watching Kevin Harned in Louisville, Kentucky at WAVE 3. At the time, Kevin was the one who kept me calm during the storms. I loved how he would always tell you what to expect, when to expect it, and talk me through the entire situation. I had the opportunity to shadow Kevin Harned throughout middle and high school. It was during those mentoring sessions I knew that this career was something I wanted to do. I graduated from Spencer County High School in Taylorsville, Kentucky (28 miles from Louisville) in 2011.\n\nFrom high school, I took my journey to Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green where I absorbed all I could about weather. I worked at the WKU Storm Team, worked on a research project which we presented at the AMS conference on the March 2, 2012 Eastern Kentucky tornado outbreak and I was fortunate enough to land my first job at WNKY on their weather team while continuing my pursuit of a degree. I worked at WNKY for two years. During my time at WKU, I was blessed to meet John Gordon of the National Weather Service in Louisville and spent a summer interning with his office as well. As I said, Weather is my passion. I graduated from Western Kentucky University May 2016. Go Tops! I moved from Bowling Green, Kentucky to Hazard, Kentucky to become the evening meteorologist at WYMT. After a year of being in the mountains, I was promoted to Chief Meteorologist where I served as the leader for the WYMT Weather Team until April 2019.\n\nI am excited to join the First Alert Weather Team here at WMBF. I’m eager to learn from Jamie, Sean and Robert. I’m also excited to get out in the community and meet each of you. When I’m not at work, I enjoy being outdoors, listening to music, playing guitar, going to concerts (I LOVE LIVE MUSIC), and watching sports. I’m a huge Pittsburgh fan. I’m in love with dogs and have two myself named Cutch after former Pittsburgh Pirate Center fielder, Andrew McCutchen and Crosby, named after Pittsburgh Penguins player Sidney Crosby. If you ever see me out in the community, please feel free to stop me and say hello. I want to get to know as many viewers as possible.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Meteorologist","slug":"","status":true,"type":"author","last_updated_date":"2021-09-09T02:52:35.330Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:23:32.752Z","description":{"basic":"In
