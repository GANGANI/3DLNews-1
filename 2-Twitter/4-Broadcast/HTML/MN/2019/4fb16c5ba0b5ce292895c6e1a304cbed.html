","longBio":"Heidi joined Northern News Now in January of 2021. She started part-time while she was in college and moved to a full-time producing role in January of 2022 after graduating from the University of Minnesota-Duluth. \n\nHeidi's passion for journalism started at a young age as she was always reading her hometown paper, the Annandale Advocate. She still has it delivered weekly to Duluth. In college, she worked for UMD's student publication, The Bark, and served as Editor-in-Chief. She also worked for UMD athletics reporting on social media during different games. \n\nDuring her time with Northern News Now Heidi has produced several of the evening shows, a few UMD Bulldog hockey games, and the Christmas City of the North Parade. She also hosts the City by City segment during our 4 p.m. newscast. \n\nWhen not working she loves to be with friends and spend time outdoors. She grew up in the heart of the lakes and loves being so close to Lake Superior. You can usually find her playing tennis or hunting for rocks on the shores of Lake Superior at all hours of the day. \n\nIf you have any suggestions send them her way,

He is from Winthrop, Massachusetts, and graduated from Penn State with a degree in Meteorology in May 2023, making this his first job as a professional meteorologist.\n\nTony has long been a fan of severe and stormy weather. As a kid, Tony loved to watch local meteorologists during big winter storms known as “Nor’easters” in New England. The winter of 2015 in Boston Massachusetts lead Tony to a life of weather after he made hundreds of dollars shoveling snow during the record setting winter.\n\nTony is also a huge hockey and football fan and is known for his overconfidence when predicting how many wins the Bruins, Patriots, and Penn State Nittany Lions will have prior to the season. He also enjoys running and biking, and bikes to and from work every day. Tony also loves to cook as he used to work on the grill at the Winthrop Yacht Club in his hometown.\n\nTony can be reached by e-mail, or by messaging him on his twitter

A native of Ely, he grew up watching CBS3 legends like Earl Henton, Heatwave Berler, and Tower-Soudan’s own Marsh Nelson.  Anderson began his broadcasting career during college as a custodian at CBS3 in 1986.  In 1987, he also took a technician job at KBJR and spent the next three years putting on the news at Channel 6 and then cleaning the building at Channel 3.  One of his first jobs at KBJR was drawing weather maps for meteorologist Jack McKenna.  That inspired an interest in the weather that led Dave back to school to earn his own meteorology degree with tutelage from the station’s other meteorologists like Carol Hall and George Kessler.\n\nWhile working on the technical crew and assisting the weather department, Dave also served as a commercial production grip, news photographer, sports reporter, and human interest reporter. \n\nAway from Northern News Now, Anderson has been an adjunct meteorology instructor for Lake Superior College since  2003.  He has been an adjunct instructor for Northland College since 2004 and teaches the broadcast meteorology practicum.  He is proud that several of his students have gone on to become broadcast meteorologists themselves.  Around the United States, those meteorologists have included Adam Young, Bryce Henry, Brandon Boswell, Kevin Haas, Mike Stevens, Joey Norton, Adam Lorch, Austin Haskins, and Sarah Gannon.\n\nAlways community-minded, Dave served on the board of the Marine Museum in Duluth and as a Cub Scout leader for several years in the past.  For more than 20 years, he has been a U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliarist and has served as flotilla commander, weather instructor, and public affairs officer.  Right now, he serves on the USCG Auxiliary National Staff in the marketing department.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kbjr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-01-02T17:22:00.889Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T00:44:21.234Z","description":{"basic":"Hot

She still has it delivered weekly to Duluth. In college, she worked for UMD's student publication, The Bark, and served as Editor-in-Chief. She also worked for UMD athletics reporting on social media during different games. \n\nDuring her time with Northern News Now Heidi has produced several of the evening shows, a few UMD Bulldog hockey games, and the Christmas City of the North Parade. She also hosts the City by City segment during our 4 p.m. newscast. \n\nWhen not working she loves to be with friends and spend time outdoors. She grew up in the heart of the lakes and loves being so close to Lake Superior.

He is from Winthrop, Massachusetts, and graduated from Penn State with a degree in Meteorology in May 2023, making this his first job as a professional meteorologist.\n\nTony has long been a fan of severe and stormy weather. As a kid, Tony loved to watch local meteorologists during big winter storms known as “Nor’easters” in New England. The winter of 2015 in Boston Massachusetts lead Tony to a life of weather after he made hundreds of dollars shoveling snow during the record setting winter.\n\nTony is also a huge hockey and football fan and is known for his overconfidence when predicting how many wins the Bruins, Patriots, and Penn State Nittany Lions will have prior to the season. He also enjoys running and biking, and bikes to and from work every day. Tony also loves to cook as he used to work on the grill at the Winthrop Yacht Club in his hometown.\n\nTony can be reached by e-mail, or by messaging him on his twitter
