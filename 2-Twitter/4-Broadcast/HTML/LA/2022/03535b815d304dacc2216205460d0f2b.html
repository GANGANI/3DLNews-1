If that happens, there could also be an embedded stronger thunderstorm within it. So keep a close eye on the radar before heading out on the morning commute and use caution on the roads should storms take place. If we do not receive much rain during the morning, that could lead to more instability in the atmosphere by the afternoon for showers and storms to fire then instead. To be clear, it does not look like a rain all day scenario will play out, but you’ll want to keep a close eye on the sky and it won’t hurt to have an umbrella handy."},{"_id":"NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/0xnUL4qK7sWGPpyv_u75RXptVIQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"Max Futurecast.png","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","owner":"maxwell.lagano@kplctv.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/0xnUL4qK7sWGPpyv_u75RXptVIQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/0xnUL4qK7sWGPpyv_u75RXptVIQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/MmICbSzHY8crQ_D_5gMnNxT23NU=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","usage_instructions":"none","version":0,"template_id":29,"_id":"54ZFDOXMRVDNXAORMNJGPXKKGU","comments":[]},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"0ab7f02b6f38f469d58429141d809e5b046e6ef8d3e9f5932d51dfff88a9bb1f"},"caption":"More disturbances will move through over the next few days and keep chances for storms going.","created_date":"2024-05-30T22:14:14Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"KPLC","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":1080,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T22:14:14Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"KPLC First Alert Forecast","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/NVJ6WZYVMVFLFMZCMBH3IIXPCA.png","version":"0.10.9","width":1920},{"_id":"IFEAGCOKXNBJPBZX3T4H5KJ5CE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717114176705,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Don’t forget that “normal” summer thunderstorms can easily produce lots of lightning, heavy rainfall, along with gusty winds and or hail; that can easily come without much warning if storms develop in place.

He learned how to read by watching the Weather Channel and reading forecasts off the TV. Various blizzards and experiencing Hurricane Sandy in 2012 furthered his interest in the weather to the point he wanted to study and pursue it as a career.\n\nMax is excited to experience Southwest Louisiana and surrounding areas.\n\nIn his downtime, Max enjoys fishing, watching the New York Giants and the New York Yankees (sorry, not sorry), throwing the baseball and football around and being

arts as well.\n\n\"I ran track and played football and soccer while also performing in plays, usually as a lead role but no big deal,\" he said. \"When I'm not working, I love golfing with my buds,
