The American people see this as lawfare, and they know it is wrong—and dangerous. President Trump will rightfully appeal this absurd verdict—and he will win!”"},{"_id":"RUEQPA3UIJAKJMNJM6LGH3VE2Y","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"VRZLCSD4FVAQDKOVWD276I2TKE","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"<i>See a spelling or grammar error in our story? </i><a href=\"mailto:WVUE-digitalcontent@gray.tv\"><i>Click Here</i></a><i> to report it.

At the age of 10 she spent two years touring the US and Canada as Annie on the 25th Anniversary National Tour. Legend has it... red is still her best color! \n\nShe has also been heard belting out on various stages and in several music venues around the city alongside her trumpet-playing dad and tambourine shaking mom. \nBe it a morning coffee run listening to true crime podcasts or an after-work cocktail cheering on her LSU Tigers, Maddie is most excited to be back in the place that made her. From the hallways of NOCCA to the streets of Da Parish, she's just happy to be home. \n\nMaddie comes to Fox 8 from WITN in Greenville, NC. She rose the ranks over her time there from a weekend reporter to an anchor and producer of Eastern Carolina's only 3 p.m. news show, ENC at Three. \n\nGot a story?

While there, he was a voice for the community of unemployed Floridians seeking answers from the state at the start of the Coronavirus pandemic. David also reported extensively on city government, holding elected officials to account, and connecting viewers to the issues affecting them.\n\n\nDavid is a graduate of the University of Florida (Go Gators!) where he won the prestigious Hearst National Journalism competition. While in school, David worked as a multimedia journalist at Fox 8 sister station WCJB TV20, where he won an AP Award for his reporting on groundwater flooding and its impacts on a small rural community.\n\n\nIt was always a dream to report in the Big Easy, and David is excited to take in all the sights and sounds of Southeast Louisiana.

At the age of 10 she spent two years touring the US and Canada as Annie on the 25th Anniversary National Tour. Legend has it... red is still her best color! \n\nShe has also been heard belting out on various stages and in several music venues around the city alongside her trumpet-playing dad and tambourine shaking mom. \nBe it a morning coffee run listening to true crime podcasts or an after-work cocktail cheering on her LSU Tigers, Maddie is most excited to be back in the place that made her. From the hallways of NOCCA to the streets of Da Parish, she's just happy to be home. \n\nMaddie comes to Fox 8 from WITN in Greenville, NC. She rose the ranks over her time there from a weekend reporter to an anchor and producer of Eastern Carolina's only 3 p.m. news show, ENC at Three. \n\nGot a story?

Her first experience as a journalist came when she was asked to write an article for the school's newspaper, and decades later, Sabrina is still writing and telling stories, only now for a much larger audience.\n\nSabrina began her broadcast career even before graduating from Loyola University, and one job led to another.\n\nSince 1996, she has been a part of the FOX 8 News team. An award winning journalist whose work as been recognized at both the national and local level, Sabrina has covered almost every story imaginable.\n\nIn January of 2009, Sabrina was the only local television reporter to cover the historic inauguration of the nation's 44th president, Barack Obama. Sabrina's coverage allowed FOX 8 viewers to experience the inaugural through the eyes of south Louisiana residents who traveled to Washington to be a part of the momentous occasion.\n\nSabrina's storytelling covers the map. Over the years, she has covered thousands of stories, including the devastation Hurricane Katrina wrought on her community, the rare snowfall that instantly becomes \"breaking news,\" local and national political races, state and local government, the North American Leaders' Summit which included President Bush, and his counterparts from Mexico and Canada, crime, and education.\n\nBecause of her many years of covering political issues, Sabrina was one of the journalists chosen in 2004 to take part in a fellowship at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. that focused on covering presidential politics.\n\nThough Sabrina has spent most of her career focusing on \"hard\" news, she relishes the times when she can tell the stories that tug at the heart, like the story of an orphan from Africa who was brought to Kenner to have surgery on his \"clawed\" hands, a condition that resulted from serious burns that were left untreated.\n\nSabrina is a member of the National Association of Black Journalists, Investigative Reporters and Editors, and the New Orleans Press Club and has mentored several aspiring journalists. She is also a Fellow of the Institute of Politics at Loyola University in New Orleans.\n\nIn her spare time, Sabrina enjoys singing, reading and traveling.\n\nFollow Sabrina on Twitter: @Sabrinafox8news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T00:00:01.021Z","description":{"basic":"Louisiana is the first state to take such a step with the FDA-approved medications"},"headlines":{"basic":"Gov.
