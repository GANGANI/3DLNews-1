She interned at KSLA's sister station, KNOE 8 News in Monroe, La., during college. From an early age, Jasmine always had an interest in news and storytelling.\n\nOriginally from the south suburbs of Chicago, Jasmine’s passion for journalism sparked in high school, where she led the daily student-run newscasts as an anchor. She excelled in broadcasting programs throughout high school, winning several 1st place Midwest regional awards.\n\nAt GSU, Jasmine made history becoming the youngest editor-in-chief of The Gramblinite Newspaper as a sophomore. She secured several media opportunities throughout college, including internships with ABC 7 News Chicago, NBC Sports Network, The Chicago Sun-Times, Coca-Cola, and the Chevrolet Discover the Unexpected program. \n\nJasmine was named a Rising Future Maker by AT&T. This provided her the opportunity to speak at the 2022 Essence Festival in front of a crowd of more than 60,000 people. She also appeared on the ABC News billboard in Times Square during her internship with The Walt Disney Company.\n\nHer passion for storytelling and journalism is evident. Jasmine’s goal is to give a voice to the voiceless in the hopes of amplifying voices of people in underrepresented communities. She believes everyone has a story to share. Jasmine goes above and beyond to tell impactful stories each day.\n\nWhen Jasmine isn’t on-air, you can find her shopping, cooking, traveling, or listening to music. She studied abroad in Italy during her freshman year at GSU and has been a vegetarian since 2016.\n\nJasmine is excited to continue sharing impactful stories across the ArkLaTex.

Before joining the KSLA team, Priscilla oversaw two programs for the 2nd Bomb Wing’s Legal Office at Barksdale Air Force Base. Currently, her active-duty husband is stationed at Barksdale. \n\nPriscilla landed her first TV job in Rapid City, S.D., where she was a reporter and anchor at KOTA. She covered local impactful stories, military affairs, treacherous weather conditions, and customized two lifestyle segments.\n\nShe then ventured into a local non-profit organization, where she was exposed to the importance and value of adoption. During her time there, she made sure to keep up with her communication skills. She created local public service announcements, hosted public events to assist in garnering donations, and started contributing reading content for a local parent magazine publication.\n\nShe also spent a few years at the State’s Attorney’s Office working in the juvenile department, assisting the chief deputy attorney in termination of parental rights. She credits her time here as one of the most impactful moments in her careers.   \n\nPriscilla received her bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Central Oklahoma, where her first gig as a student reporter was writing for the school’s newspaper and anchoring their daily newscast. Priscilla is excited to make her way back into the news industry and tell stories that show the beauty of the ArkLaTex communities, to bring awareness to mental health issues, and to showcase the stories that lie within our backyards.\n\nPriscilla wasted no time getting to know her community upon arriving in Louisiana. She's a huge advocate for volunteering and giving back and encourages everyone to do what they can to help make their area a better place to live. Her relationship with Christ keeps her grounded and helps her navigate through life’s valleys and mountains. She's quick to point out that His timing is always spot on, and always has a purpose.\n\nWhen she’s not reporting, you’ll find her elbow deep in dirt, learning new ways to reap a better harvest. Priscilla considers herself a “seasonal developer.” With every growing season, she incorporates a new crop to study and takes pride in cooking with the produce she grows. She's always seeking tips and tricks in navigating different soils and zones, as she aspires to learn more about agricultural.\n\nPriscilla has two children who keep her busy and bring out the best in her. She describes them as being the “light of her life” and is very devoted to empowering their dreams and ambitions. You can also catch her and her family shopping at her local farmer’s markets supporting small business owners and trying to adapt to the humidity!\n\nIf you have any story ideas, she would love to hear from you!\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ksla","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","last_updated_date":"2024-03-12T21:31:47.899Z","author_type":"Staff","instagram":"priscillab_tv","twitter":"PrissB_TV","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089939961901","youtube":"kslachannel12","personal_website":"www.ksla.com"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:08:02.817Z","description":{"basic":"A

She excelled in broadcasting programs throughout high school, winning several 1st place Midwest regional awards.\n\nAt GSU, Jasmine made history becoming the youngest editor-in-chief of The Gramblinite Newspaper as a sophomore. She secured several media opportunities throughout college, including internships with ABC 7 News Chicago, NBC Sports Network, The Chicago Sun-Times, Coca-Cola, and the Chevrolet Discover the Unexpected program. \n\nJasmine was named a Rising Future Maker by AT&T. This provided her the opportunity to speak at the 2022 Essence Festival in front of a crowd of more than 60,000 people. She also appeared on the ABC News billboard in Times Square during her internship with The Walt Disney Company.\n\nHer passion for storytelling and journalism is evident. Jasmine’s goal is to give a voice to the voiceless in the hopes of amplifying voices of people in underrepresented communities. She believes everyone has a story to share. Jasmine goes above and beyond to tell impactful stories each day.\n\nWhen Jasmine isn’t on-air, you can find her shopping, cooking, traveling, or listening to music.
