agreed that Trump falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 election.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The decision came after about

But the former president spoke to reporters outside the courtroom, calling it a &ldquo;rigged, disgraceful trial,&rdquo; and said the &ldquo;real verdict&rdquo; will be rendered on Election Day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump&rsquo;s legal team signaled it would appeal the conviction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>New York Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11. Trump faces a maximum sentence of up to 4 years in prison, but as a first-time, white-collar offender, no jail time is necessary, and he could receive probation instead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The jury heard from 22 witnesses during just over four weeks of testimony in Manhattan&rsquo;s criminal court. Jurors also weighed other evidence &mdash; mostly documents like phone records, invoices and checks to Michael Cohen, Trump&rsquo;s once loyal &ldquo;fixer,&rdquo; who paid Daniels to keep her story of an alleged affair with the former president quiet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The facts of the payments and invoices labeled as legal services were not in dispute. What prosecutors needed to prove was that Trump falsified the records in order to further another crime &mdash; in this case violating the New York election law that makes it a crime for &ldquo;any two or more persons who conspire to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means.&rdquo; The jurors were able to choose whether those unlawful means were violating the Federal Elections Campaign Act, falsifying tax returns, or falsifying other business records.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump&rsquo;s defense focused intently on the credibility of Cohen, and argued that influencing an election is not illegal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The verdict came more than a year after a \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/30/1164766452/trump-indictment-new-york-bragg-stormy-daniels\">grand jury indicted Trump\u003c/a>, on March 30, 2023, marking the first time a former or sitting president faced criminal charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/live-updates/trump-indictment-arraignment-arrest-new-york#republican-lawmakers-continue-to-paint-the-case-against-trump-as-an-unjust-overreach\">Republicans\u003c/a> quickly dismissed the indictment \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/live-updates/trump-indictment-arraignment-arrest-new-york#republican-lawmakers-continue-to-paint-the-case-against-trump-as-an-unjust-overreach\">as an overreach of power\u003c/a> by Democratic District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who had brought the charges. Trump has continually blasted the case as &ldquo;election interference&rdquo; affecting his 2024 campaign.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cstrong>What the jury heard\u003c/strong>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>In August 2015, two months after Trump announced his 2016 presidential bid, David Pecker, then the publisher of the \u003cem>National Enquirer \u003c/em>tabloid, met with Trump and Cohen at Trump Tower, according to testimony from Pecker and Cohen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At that meeting, Pecker testified, it was agreed that he would be the &ldquo;eyes and ears&rdquo; of the Trump campaign. His job was to look out for negative stories from women he could &ldquo;take off the marketplace,&rdquo; by buying up the rights but never publishing them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The plan, as Pecker outlined it, was for him to suppress these stories, and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump&rsquo;s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication.[aside label=\"related coverage\" tag=\"trump\"]Over the next year, Pecker said he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former \u003cem>Playboy \u003c/em>model Karen McDougal. Around June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a yearlong affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the \u003cem>Access Hollywood \u003c/em>tape, where Trump could be heard boasting &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab &rsquo;em by the p****.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The next day, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations she&rsquo;d had a sexual encounter with \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/07/1249318101/stormy-daniels-trump-trial-new-york\">Trump in 2006\u003c/a> in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In her testimony, Daniels said there was a &ldquo;power imbalance&rdquo; when, after leaving the suite&rsquo;s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. That&rsquo;s when, Daniels said, they had sex.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show \u003cem>Celebrity Apprentice\u003c/em>. This detail &mdash; that the sex wasn&rsquo;t entirely wanted &mdash; caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, &ldquo;Trump knew what happened in that hotel room&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t want it to come out. The adult film actor&rsquo;s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Juan M. Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As October drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Daniels was paid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks testified Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid by Trump. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls which Cohen had said was made through Trump&rsquo;s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, the heart of the case rested on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization&rsquo;s former comptroller, Jeff McConney.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>McConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen&rsquo;s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump&rsquo;s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; to cover Cohen&rsquo;s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The payments would be described as pursuant to a &ldquo;legal retainer.&rdquo; (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump&rsquo;s civil fraud trial, did not testify.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal &ldquo;retainers.&rdquo; Nine of the checks were signed by Trump, himself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that &ldquo;it was going to be one heck of a ride&rdquo; in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborated that the two met in the Oval Office at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen&rsquo;s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen&rsquo;s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; But Costello&rsquo;s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen&rsquo;s lawyers he wanted to pay, and that Costello was concerned about not giving &ldquo;the appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,&rdquo; referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump&rsquo;s lawyer at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cstrong>How this conviction could affect the 2024 election\u003c/strong>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>This likely is the only one of Trump&rsquo;s four ongoing criminal cases that will be heard ahead of the 2024 election in November, since federal trials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and a state case in Georgia are in various stages of delays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This decision in New York is likely to have rippling effects as Trump campaigns as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For now, the other 54 criminal charges he faces have not turned off potential voters and, among some Republicans, the cases have bolstered support for him. However, a conviction may not play well with independent and swing voters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The latest \u003ca href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/novembers-presidential-election-may-2024/\">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll\u003c/a>, from May, showed that 17% of voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is convicted, while 15% said they would be more likely to vote for him.

His job was to look out for negative stories from women he could &ldquo;take off the marketplace,&rdquo; by buying up the rights but never publishing them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The plan, as Pecker outlined it, was for him to suppress these stories, and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump&rsquo;s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication.\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"aside","attributes":{"named":{"label":"related coverage ","tag":"trump"},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>Over the next year, Pecker said he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former \u003cem>Playboy \u003c/em>model Karen McDougal. Around June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a yearlong affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the \u003cem>Access Hollywood \u003c/em>tape, where Trump could be heard boasting &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab &rsquo;em by the p****.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The next day, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations she&rsquo;d had a sexual encounter with \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/07/1249318101/stormy-daniels-trump-trial-new-york\">Trump in 2006\u003c/a> in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In her testimony, Daniels said there was a &ldquo;power imbalance&rdquo; when, after leaving the suite&rsquo;s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. That&rsquo;s when, Daniels said, they had sex.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show \u003cem>Celebrity Apprentice\u003c/em>. This detail &mdash; that the sex wasn&rsquo;t entirely wanted &mdash; caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, &ldquo;Trump knew what happened in that hotel room&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t want it to come out. The adult film actor&rsquo;s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Juan M. Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As October drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Daniels was paid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks testified Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid by Trump. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls which Cohen had said was made through Trump&rsquo;s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, the heart of the case rested on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization&rsquo;s former comptroller, Jeff McConney.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>McConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen&rsquo;s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump&rsquo;s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; to cover Cohen&rsquo;s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The payments would be described as pursuant to a &ldquo;legal retainer.&rdquo; (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump&rsquo;s civil fraud trial, did not testify.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal &ldquo;retainers.&rdquo; Nine of the checks were signed by Trump, himself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that &ldquo;it was going to be one heck of a ride&rdquo; in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborated that the two met in the Oval Office at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen&rsquo;s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen&rsquo;s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; But Costello&rsquo;s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen&rsquo;s lawyers he wanted to pay, and that Costello was concerned about not giving &ldquo;the appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,&rdquo; referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump&rsquo;s lawyer at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cstrong>How this conviction could affect the 2024 election\u003c/strong>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>This likely is the only one of Trump&rsquo;s four ongoing criminal cases that will be heard ahead of the 2024 election in November, since federal trials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and a state case in Georgia are in various stages of delays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This decision in New York is likely to have rippling effects as Trump campaigns as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. For now, the other 54 criminal charges he faces have not turned off potential voters and, among some Republicans, the cases have bolstered support for him. However, a conviction may not play well with independent and swing voters.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The latest \u003ca href=\"https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/novembers-presidential-election-may-2024/\">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll\u003c/a>, from May, showed that 17% of voters said they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he is convicted, while 15% said they would be more likely to vote for him.

Spamouflage operates across a wide range of social media platforms and internet forums, pushing pro-China messages and attacking critics of Beijing. Last year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it&rsquo;s ever disrupted and linked it to Chinese law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Both Doppelganger and Spamouflage used OpenAI tools to generate comments in multiple languages that were posted across social media sites. The Russian network also used AI to translate articles from Russian into English and French and to turn website articles into Facebook posts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Spamouflage accounts used AI to debug code for a website targeting Chinese dissidents, to analyze social media posts, and to research news and current events. Some posts from fake Spamouflage accounts only received replies from other fake accounts in the same network.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another previously unreported Russian network banned by OpenAI focused its efforts on spamming \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086483703/telegram-ukraine-war-russia\">the messaging app Telegram\u003c/a>. It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta. The posts were aimed at audiences in the U.S., Canada and Israel.

Spamouflage operates across a wide range of social media platforms and internet forums, pushing pro-China messages and attacking critics of Beijing. Last year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it&rsquo;s ever disrupted and linked it to Chinese law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Both Doppelganger and Spamouflage used OpenAI tools to generate comments in multiple languages that were posted across social media sites. The Russian network also used AI to translate articles from Russian into English and French and to turn website articles into Facebook posts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Spamouflage accounts used AI to debug code for a website targeting Chinese dissidents, to analyze social media posts, and to research news and current events.

It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta. The posts were aimed at audiences in the U.S., Canada and Israel. Meta banned Stoic from its platforms and sent the company a cease and desist letter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>OpenAI said the Israeli operation used AI to generate and edit articles and comments posted across Instagram, Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, as well as to create fictitious personas and bios for fake accounts.

Our final episode is July 18th.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">We&rsquo;ve had a great run, gleaned wisdom from the practitioners, gotten insight from the social scientists and soaked up game from the artists who make this place what it is. Thank you all for this run! Looking back at what we&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s amazing. We&rsquo;ve created a huge archive of what was happening in the Bay Area for the past half decade.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&rsquo;ll share more thoughts on the final episode, but for this week we&rsquo;re going \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">into\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that rich archive for a classic episode from the summer of 2022, where we talked to a handful of Bay Area tattoo artists for our series called Permanent Behavior.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond the idea of needles rapidly jabbing through skin and leaving indelible ink, we talked about the ins-and-outs of tattoo culture. The art, the business and the politics. We also discussed family, which is a big part of today&rsquo;s guest&rsquo;s story.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez was raised in West Berkeley, where his parents taught him artistic techniques like shading and cholo-style lettering.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">He also learned about the impact of declining industry in his neighborhood and his family&rsquo;s connection to the local car culture&ndash; all of which poured into his artistic craft.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the center of our conversation was this idea of permanency.\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw,\u003c/b>\u003cb>\u003ci> in clip\u003c/i>\u003c/b>\u003cb>: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You do work that&rsquo;s permanent and long lasting. Like I just I talk to artists all the time and there&rsquo;s a certain impermanence to the art. And so in doing tattoos, like, how do you even approach doing something that you know is going to stick with folks forever?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez, Guest: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">That hit me weird, too, because ah, you know, I started got into graffiti mural art and that&rsquo;s like, you know, part of the game is it&rsquo;s going to get covered, it&rsquo;s going to get gone over. And so I like doing something a little more permanent. I feel like definitely at first, I was like, &lsquo;Oh, sh*t, I can&rsquo;t go fix this up later. I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t like touch it up in a couple of years when it fades.&rsquo; I mean, you can kind of with tattoos, but it&rsquo;s a whole different thing. So made me a little nervous at first, just like, okay, I definitely got to get it \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">right first time. I never did anything in my life permanent seemed like.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">When they start tripping about being permanent, ya know, only until you decompose.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">More deep thoughts from Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez, right after this.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bring us back to the origins, how&rsquo;d you get started in art in general?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first influences are like from my mom.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">She used to draw the little old school, like these kind of chola drawings, you know, the Chicano style. Cholas would like the feathered hair, all nice and detailed.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I remember I used to like kind of create my own little comic characters and my uncles drew too, and they all kind of did that same kind of that Cali-Chicano style. My uncles did like the the cholo letters, you know, we&rsquo;d see them around the house, like written on the books and all this stuff.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it was just more about like seeing them make stuff with their hands. Like my dad was also like carpenter, mechanic, built lowriders and stuff.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think definitely with the family was the first influence and then I think what really&hellip; like in school. I would definitely always try to try to wiggle my way into &lsquo;Ay, Can I just do a poster for like half credit and like, you know, only write half the assignment? Oh yeah.&rsquo; So, I started like, you know, early on, I knew I could kind of wiggle it that way, so that was cool.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like, honestly, one of the things that got me really serious was when, you know, girls would be like, &lsquo;Ooh, that looks pretty. Can you write my name?&rsquo; \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">All right. Yeah. Okay. They like cursive. I mean, let me get my cursive game up.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gotcha. Okay. So it&rsquo;s the amalgamation of all those influences, you know a little bit of everything pouring into you. How would you describe like cholo style for someone who was goofy, just didn&rsquo;t know, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like the style kind of came from them trying to emulate, like, old English. And what you&rsquo;re saying is like old English was ah anything important was written in Old English, like a death certificate, birth certificate, always Old English. So like when you look at cholo style, it is like kind of a simplified version of Old English, just like, you know, the straight up and down letters. But all the letters have this similar like structure that they&rsquo;re made from.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But it&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t need a fancy brush to do. You can do it with like one line or the spray paint or, you know, marker or something. And the thing has always been about, representing people that aren&rsquo;t really seen and it&rsquo;s like always been about that.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is kind of mind blowing to me that you said, all right, so writing in that like dignified kind of font, if you will, and how it comes from Old English by way of like governing forces. You mentioned like birth certificates, death certificates. And I know that there&rsquo;s a stereotype around like that type of lettering that it comes from prisons as well, or that there&rsquo;s, you know, like it&rsquo;s related to, you know, kind of prison culture. But to say that like, &lsquo;No, this is a way to dignify a people, you know, a group. Hell, whatever I&rsquo;m writing, whatever word I&rsquo;m putting in there,&rsquo; because I know in like yeah, I know in black culture as well there&rsquo;s that Old English is definitely a form of tattooing styling that you put words or even commemorate a fallen friend in that font. Sorry, just had a lightbulb moment right there.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel&rsquo;s a child of immigrants who raised him in the industrial bay side neighborhood of West Berkeley.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kind of moved around Berkeley a lot. Mexican side was like more West Berkeley, my Filipino side was more technically in North Berkeley. We called it South Central Berkeley.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right, p\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">arents first came over. They both came when they were probably about 13, 12 ish. And they happened to both come to Hunter&rsquo;s Point, there first, and then came to Berkeley around the sixties, something like that.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">How did they describe sixties West Berkeley, to you?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">They never really explained too much about like old school Berkeley. They more&hellip; feel like they talk more about when they&rsquo;re in high school and their partying. Kind of always about chillin&rsquo;.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">My parents met when they&rsquo;re when they&rsquo;re in high school and they&rsquo;re in Berkeley High. Actually the story is my dad was working at a gas station right on what is like University and MLK or somewhere right there. And my mom was like walking from Berkeley High. And like she said that she saw him smoking a cigarette or somethin&rsquo;, you know, smoking at the gas station. Some 70&rsquo;s shi*t. \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[laughs]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> She came over and, you know, asked for a light and supposedly, like he lit her hair on fire like, well, he was.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the gas station?

I mean, my dad my dad was known for embellishing a little bit, so it could be made up, but it sounds pretty cool.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">T\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">hey were part of a car club, right?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, it was called Pueblo Nuevo&hellip;Pueblo Nuevo de West Berkeley. My dad and my uncle from my mom&rsquo;s side had started the car club.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how did, how did Berkeley, as a city, pour into your work as an artist?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of murals around Berkeley that influenced me. The Che mural, the West Campus, the recycling mural that was on MLK. The apartment we lived on, it was on Bancroft and, like McKinley, literally a block below Berkeley High. I went \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">from seeing all the Chicano styles that my family was doing and seeing the graff on the street and the murals, I think that definitely seeped its way in.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel also came up with a crew known as Trust Your Struggle. The collective of artists do work for low or no cost in communities that could benefit from murals or other visual art that supports local culture. They started in 2003, and they&rsquo;ve done work not only in the Bay but in Hawaii and the Philippines, and other places.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">T\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">rust Your Struggle is like like, it was definitely like-minded folks who had a lot of the same passions and same views on the world, politics and life and everything. I think we&rsquo;re more just like a crew of homies.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the earlier things we were doing was these mural tours. You know, like the first one we went to is Mexico. We went started in Mexico and like worked our way down, like on bus all the way to Nicaragua. It is basically donated murals, you know, linked up with different organizations and painted. And I remember one of the last ones we did in 2009, went to the Philippines.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were meeting up with these orgs and stuff. Like this is the one we&rsquo;d probably raised the most money for and put together. And we get out there and we&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna do this mural for y&rsquo;all, it&rsquo;s free, blah, blah, blah.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Great, this is beautiful.&rsquo; And then we see like how they living and they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Oh sh*t. Like, they don&rsquo;t need a mural. They need food. They need, like, some clothes.&rsquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it made us think of different ways. it humbled us and you know, like you ain&rsquo;t gonna save the world with a painting. Like, it might look pretty. But, you know, some of us have got more into, like, actual, like, legislation. Y&rsquo;know, my boy Rob is, like, doing, like, children&rsquo;s books, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I mean, I&rsquo;m doing tattoos, which is just like not like a political thing, is a smaller scale, intimate thing, but the thing that&rsquo;s cool about tattoos it&rsquo;s always, like well not always, there&rsquo;s definitely some people are not is getting it for the aesthetics but it&rsquo;s like you know it&rsquo;s always some transitional period in most people&rsquo;s lives when they&rsquo;re getting it. And it&rsquo;s pretty cool to share that with them and even help them guide them through it.

But like to get something to signify that you&rsquo;ve gone through a transitional period is to say that I want something to last forever from this doorway that I&rsquo;m going through. And you&rsquo;re more or less holding that door open or helping, you know, construct the doorway.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even sometimes I&rsquo;m closing it, like, now, you know, don&rsquo;t go through that door!&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You&rsquo;re right, right.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I don&rsquo;t know if you want that door. \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;[laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you have any specifically that came from a point of transition in your life?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first big ones I got were um, actually my dad had this rose of my mom&rsquo;s name and I pretty much just tried to, when he passed away in 2009, I pretty much just did the exact same thing he had, on both arms. I mean, those are probably my most meaningful tattoos, maybe I would say. The other ones have been a little more loose. Like, like, &lsquo;Okay, yeah, that looks cool. Let&rsquo;s do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I definitely know people like, &lsquo;Whatever, I&rsquo;m in Vegas, time to get tattooed, I ain&rsquo;t trippin&rsquo;. But yeah, definitely. When I was younger, it was like, What&rsquo;s my first tat going to be? Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid, you know? I went with, you know, my aunt, my mom, my sister, family names, you know, that kind of thing.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can&rsquo;t go wrong with mom&rsquo;s name, right? \u003cem>[laughs]\u003c/em>&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right. And so when your mom saw your tattoo that you did in honor of your father, how did she react?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Um. I mean, I think it definitely. She was sad just because it reminded her of my dad. You know, I remember even. I mean, her saying one time she was like, &lsquo;Damn, you got your dad&rsquo;s hands. Like, especially with, like, the tattoo.&rsquo; Like the same thing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like, same placement. Yeah. She&rsquo;s also proud too because she thinks she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s really proud that I get to do what I love for a living, you know? I feel like it&rsquo;s almost like that was the reason why they sacrificed to come to this country when they&rsquo;re young so the kids can, like, do what the f*ck they want.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel&rsquo;s got a strong POV when it comes to his work, but he says he doesn&rsquo;t stick to just one style.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well, I think, like the big thing for me with tattooing is, you know, I&rsquo;ve always been about collaboration in my paintings and painting with the crews has always been collaborative. But these like tattoos, it&rsquo;s like a real collaboration, like because it&rsquo;s like this is long term bonding. You&rsquo;re making every time with somebody.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So I generally try to have it be about more about what they want, you know. I definitely will take, you know, my knowledge and expertise and try to, like, make sure it&rsquo;s going to be something that&rsquo;s going to look good years down the line, make that work with what they want, you know. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of my specialty is like versatility.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&rsquo;m sure you get a mixture of people coming in with different ideas for artwork that they want.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I remember we got this math club one time, which is funny is they all got like inner lip tattoos, but they all like, if you seen them, you know, you would never thought that they would have had tattoos. But I guess that&rsquo;s why they went with the inner lip, because that&rsquo;s like the most hidden places, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wait, hold on. Wait. A whole math club got the same inner lip tattoo? What did they get tattooed inside their lip?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">They didn&rsquo;t all get the same thing, but they all got the same place. I remember one of them, I think, said, &lsquo;F*ck off,&rsquo; actually. It was funny, they&rsquo;re all were &lsquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re the math club. Yeah. This is our bonding experience.&rsquo; And we get that, you know, we get the range.You get that. But we still get, you know, dudes that are spending a lot of time in prison and, you know, want to like, finish off their prison style tattoo. Actually, I&rsquo;ve actually done a lot of a couple of prison cover ups, too, like: &lsquo;I got this in prison. Can you fix this for me?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done a lot of those I feel like.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you feel like your work is a community service?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t really think of it like that, but it really is, man. You know, just yesterday, my boy had a Raiders tattoo that, you know, the dude&rsquo;s, the Raider face dude was like, was all smushed up. Like, you couldn&rsquo;t see none of the features and&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">couldn&rsquo;t read the letters and I just brought it back. That was like a service to him, making him feel better about hisself something It&rsquo;s like a service. It is a really a service, you know.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">All right. So another comparison or just a question I&rsquo;ve had&hellip; So in the graff world, you go from a tool like learning into scribbles, you know, tagging your name to doing bubble letters and working your way up to, you doing huge murals. Yeah is there a similar chain of command in the tattoo world?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It&rsquo;s similar in that, um, you definitely got to, like, pay your dues you know to get, like, respected in the industry. You gotta like, you got to apprentice with somebody who&rsquo;s already respected. Before like, recently the game has hella changed And a lot of a lot of those old-heads will say it&rsquo;s f*cked up now because, you know, people are learning how to tattoo off of YouTube and sh*t where as even like ten years ago it&rsquo;s like, literally like like damn near like a f*cking secret society that you had to like. claw and beg to get your way into it. Like a big thing with your apprenticeship is generally not paid. The Apprentice is the one that has to be there on time, has to spend the most hours. You know, has to do like the most like grunt work. And it&rsquo;s like two years before you can even start to like pick up a machine or something. I mean, this is definitely more like the whole school classic way is definitely changing these last couple of years which. It&rsquo;s all f*cked up now with social media. New tattooers would get like one famous client, and then all of a sudden they&rsquo;re, you know, $2,000 an hour. Like damn, your work isn&rsquo;t even that good. It&rsquo;s like a big thing about tattooing is like, you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re doing until you see, like, some sh*t you did like 15 years down the line, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like it can be the prettiest, most detailed thing, but the real test is what&rsquo;s it going to look like 15, 20 years later, you know? Is it going to stay? Is it going to &ndash; are the colors are going to hold up? Are your lines going to fade out. So I think definitely like the old school, the old school tattooers there, they&rsquo;re definitely focused on that more, you know. So I mean, because even before I got into tattooing that traditional style that\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">they call it American Traditional, where it&rsquo;s like. You know, like the real thick lines, kind of simpler drawings, like, you know, the classic images like the panther or, you know, the kind of like the pin-up style ladies and roses.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like a kind of didn&rsquo;t really feel. Before I really knew about tattooing. I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate that stuff that much, you know. But then after I started doing it and really like, &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a reason why those lines are so thick,&rsquo;, or there&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s so simple because, you know, they want, you know, they want this to look good in 15 years, you know. And this just a. And there&rsquo;s a reason why they make it bold and simple.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you Miguel Bounce Perez!

Our final episode is July 18th.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">We&rsquo;ve had a great run, gleaned wisdom from the practitioners, gotten insight from the social scientists and soaked up game from the artists who make this place what it is. Thank you all for this run! Looking back at what we&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s amazing. We&rsquo;ve created a huge archive of what was happening in the Bay Area for the past half decade.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&rsquo;ll share more thoughts on the final episode, but for this week we&rsquo;re going \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">into\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that rich archive for a classic episode from the summer of 2022, where we talked to a handful of Bay Area tattoo artists for our series called Permanent Behavior.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond the idea of needles rapidly jabbing through skin and leaving indelible ink, we talked about the ins-and-outs of tattoo culture. The art, the business and the politics. We also discussed family, which is a big part of today&rsquo;s guest&rsquo;s story.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez was raised in West Berkeley, where his parents taught him artistic techniques like shading and cholo-style lettering.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">He also learned about the impact of declining industry in his neighborhood and his family&rsquo;s connection to the local car culture&ndash; all of which poured into his artistic craft.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the center of our conversation was this idea of permanency.\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw,\u003c/b>\u003cb>\u003ci> in clip\u003c/i>\u003c/b>\u003cb>: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You do work that&rsquo;s permanent and long lasting. Like I just I talk to artists all the time and there&rsquo;s a certain impermanence to the art. And so in doing tattoos, like, how do you even approach doing something that you know is going to stick with folks forever?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez, Guest: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">That hit me weird, too, because ah, you know, I started got into graffiti mural art and that&rsquo;s like, you know, part of the game is it&rsquo;s going to get covered, it&rsquo;s going to get gone over. And so I like doing something a little more permanent. I feel like definitely at first, I was like, &lsquo;Oh, sh*t, I can&rsquo;t go fix this up later. I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t like touch it up in a couple of years when it fades.&rsquo; I mean, you can kind of with tattoos, but it&rsquo;s a whole different thing. So made me a little nervous at first, just like, okay, I definitely got to get it \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">right first time. I never did anything in my life permanent seemed like.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">When they start tripping about being permanent, ya know, only until you decompose.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">More deep thoughts from Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez, right after this.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bring us back to the origins, how&rsquo;d you get started in art in general?\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first influences are like from my mom.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">She used to draw the little old school, like these kind of chola drawings, you know, the Chicano style. Cholas would like the feathered hair, all nice and detailed.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I remember I used to like kind of create my own little comic characters and my uncles drew too, and they all kind of did that same kind of that Cali-Chicano style. My uncles did like the the cholo letters, you know, we&rsquo;d see them around the house, like written on the books and all this stuff.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it was just more about like seeing them make stuff with their hands. Like my dad was also like carpenter, mechanic, built lowriders and stuff.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think definitely with the family was the first influence and then I think what really&hellip; like in school. I would definitely always try to try to wiggle my way into &lsquo;Ay, Can I just do a poster for like half credit and like, you know, only write half the assignment? Oh yeah.&rsquo; So, I started like, you know, early on, I knew I could kind of wiggle it that way, so that was cool.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like, honestly, one of the things that got me really serious was when, you know, girls would be like, &lsquo;Ooh, that looks pretty. Can you write my name?&rsquo; \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">All right. Yeah. Okay. They like cursive. I mean, let me get my cursive game up.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gotcha. Okay. So it&rsquo;s the amalgamation of all those influences, you know a little bit of everything pouring into you. How would you describe like cholo style for someone who was goofy, just didn&rsquo;t know, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like the style kind of came from them trying to emulate, like, old English. And what you&rsquo;re saying is like old English was ah anything important was written in Old English, like a death certificate, birth certificate, always Old English. So like when you look at cholo style, it is like kind of a simplified version of Old English, just like, you know, the straight up and down letters. But all the letters have this similar like structure that they&rsquo;re made from.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But it&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t need a fancy brush to do. You can do it with like one line or the spray paint or, you know, marker or something. And the thing has always been about, representing people that aren&rsquo;t really seen and it&rsquo;s like always been about that.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is kind of mind blowing to me that you said, all right, so writing in that like dignified kind of font, if you will, and how it comes from Old English by way of like governing forces. You mentioned like birth certificates, death certificates. And I know that there&rsquo;s a stereotype around like that type of lettering that it comes from prisons as well, or that there&rsquo;s, you know, like it&rsquo;s related to, you know, kind of prison culture. But to say that like, &lsquo;No, this is a way to dignify a people, you know, a group. Hell, whatever I&rsquo;m writing, whatever word I&rsquo;m putting in there,&rsquo; because I know in like yeah, I know in black culture as well there&rsquo;s that Old English is definitely a form of tattooing styling that you put words or even commemorate a fallen friend in that font. Sorry, just had a lightbulb moment right there.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel&rsquo;s a child of immigrants who raised him in the industrial bay side neighborhood of West Berkeley.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kind of moved around Berkeley a lot. Mexican side was like more West Berkeley, my Filipino side was more technically in North Berkeley. We called it South Central Berkeley.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Right, p\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">arents first came over. They both came when they were probably about 13, 12 ish. And they happened to both come to Hunter&rsquo;s Point, there first, and then came to Berkeley around the sixties, something like that.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">How did they describe sixties West Berkeley, to you?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">They never really explained too much about like old school Berkeley. They more&hellip; feel like they talk more about when they&rsquo;re in high school and their partying. Kind of always about chillin&rsquo;.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">My parents met when they&rsquo;re when they&rsquo;re in high school and they&rsquo;re in Berkeley High. Actually the story is my dad was working at a gas station right on what is like University and MLK or somewhere right there. And my mom was like walking from Berkeley High. And like she said that she saw him smoking a cigarette or somethin&rsquo;, you know, smoking at the gas station. Some 70&rsquo;s shi*t. \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[laughs]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> She came over and, you know, asked for a light and supposedly, like he lit her hair on fire like, well, he was.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the gas station? How dangerous is that?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, that&rsquo;s the story I heard. I mean, my dad my dad was known for embellishing a little bit, so it could be made up, but it sounds pretty cool.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">T\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">hey were part of a car club, right?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, it was called Pueblo Nuevo&hellip;Pueblo Nuevo de West Berkeley. My dad and my uncle from my mom&rsquo;s side had started the car club.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how did, how did Berkeley, as a city, pour into your work as an artist?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of murals around Berkeley that influenced me. The Che mural, the West Campus, the recycling mural that was on MLK. The apartment we lived on, it was on Bancroft and, like McKinley, literally a block below Berkeley High. I went \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">from seeing all the Chicano styles that my family was doing and seeing the graff on the street and the murals, I think that definitely seeped its way in.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel also came up with a crew known as Trust Your Struggle. The collective of artists do work for low or no cost in communities that could benefit from murals or other visual art that supports local culture. They started in 2003, and they&rsquo;ve done work not only in the Bay but in Hawaii and the Philippines, and other places.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">T\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">rust Your Struggle is like like, it was definitely like-minded folks who had a lot of the same passions and same views on the world, politics and life and everything. I think we&rsquo;re more just like a crew of homies.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the earlier things we were doing was these mural tours. You know, like the first one we went to is Mexico. We went started in Mexico and like worked our way down, like on bus all the way to Nicaragua. It is basically donated murals, you know, linked up with different organizations and painted. And I remember one of the last ones we did in 2009, went to the Philippines.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were meeting up with these orgs and stuff. Like this is the one we&rsquo;d probably raised the most money for and put together. And we get out there and we&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna do this mural for y&rsquo;all, it&rsquo;s free, blah, blah, blah.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Great, this is beautiful.&rsquo; And then we see like how they living and they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Oh sh*t. Like, they don&rsquo;t need a mural. They need food. They need, like, some clothes.&rsquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it made us think of different ways. it humbled us and you know, like you ain&rsquo;t gonna save the world with a painting. Like, it might look pretty. But, you know, some of us have got more into, like, actual, like, legislation. Y&rsquo;know, my boy Rob is, like, doing, like, children&rsquo;s books, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I mean, I&rsquo;m doing tattoos, which is just like not like a political thing, is a smaller scale, intimate thing, but the thing that&rsquo;s cool about tattoos it&rsquo;s always, like well not always, there&rsquo;s definitely some people are not is getting it for the aesthetics but it&rsquo;s like you know it&rsquo;s always some transitional period in most people&rsquo;s lives when they&rsquo;re getting it. And it&rsquo;s pretty cool to share that with them and even help them guide them through it.

But like to get something to signify that you&rsquo;ve gone through a transitional period is to say that I want something to last forever from this doorway that I&rsquo;m going through. And you&rsquo;re more or less holding that door open or helping, you know, construct the doorway.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even sometimes I&rsquo;m closing it, like, now, you know, don&rsquo;t go through that door!&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You&rsquo;re right, right.\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [laughs]&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I don&rsquo;t know if you want that door. \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;[laughs] \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you have any specifically that came from a point of transition in your life?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first big ones I got were um, actually my dad had this rose of my mom&rsquo;s name and I pretty much just tried to, when he passed away in 2009, I pretty much just did the exact same thing he had, on both arms. I mean, those are probably my most meaningful tattoos, maybe I would say. The other ones have been a little more loose. Like, like, &lsquo;Okay, yeah, that looks cool. Let&rsquo;s do it.&rsquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I definitely know people like, &lsquo;Whatever, I&rsquo;m in Vegas, time to get tattooed, I ain&rsquo;t trippin&rsquo;. But yeah, definitely. When I was younger, it was like, What&rsquo;s my first tat going to be? Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid, you know? I went with, you know, my aunt, my mom, my sister, family names, you know, that kind of thing.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can&rsquo;t go wrong with mom&rsquo;s name, right? \u003cem>[laughs]\u003c/em>&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right. And so when your mom saw your tattoo that you did in honor of your father, how did she react?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Um. I mean, I think it definitely. She was sad just because it reminded her of my dad. You know, I remember even. I mean, her saying one time she was like, &lsquo;Damn, you got your dad&rsquo;s hands. Like, especially with, like, the tattoo.&rsquo; Like the same thing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like, same placement. Yeah. She&rsquo;s also proud too because she thinks she&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s really proud that I get to do what I love for a living, you know? I feel like it&rsquo;s almost like that was the reason why they sacrificed to come to this country when they&rsquo;re young so the kids can, like, do what the f*ck they want.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miguel&rsquo;s got a strong POV when it comes to his work, but he says he doesn&rsquo;t stick to just one style.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Well, I think, like the big thing for me with tattooing is, you know, I&rsquo;ve always been about collaboration in my paintings and painting with the crews has always been collaborative. But these like tattoos, it&rsquo;s like a real collaboration, like because it&rsquo;s like this is long term bonding. You&rsquo;re making every time with somebody.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">So I generally try to have it be about more about what they want, you know. I definitely will take, you know, my knowledge and expertise and try to, like, make sure it&rsquo;s going to be something that&rsquo;s going to look good years down the line, make that work with what they want, you know. And I think that&rsquo;s kind of my specialty is like versatility.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I&rsquo;m sure you get a mixture of people coming in with different ideas for artwork that they want.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">I remember we got this math club one time, which is funny is they all got like inner lip tattoos, but they all like, if you seen them, you know, you would never thought that they would have had tattoos. But I guess that&rsquo;s why they went with the inner lip, because that&rsquo;s like the most hidden places, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wait, hold on. Wait. A whole math club got the same inner lip tattoo? What did they get tattooed inside their lip?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">They didn&rsquo;t all get the same thing, but they all got the same place. I remember one of them, I think, said, &lsquo;F*ck off,&rsquo; actually. It was funny, they&rsquo;re all were &lsquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re the math club. Yeah. This is our bonding experience.&rsquo; And we get that, you know, we get the range.You get that. But we still get, you know, dudes that are spending a lot of time in prison and, you know, want to like, finish off their prison style tattoo. Actually, I&rsquo;ve actually done a lot of a couple of prison cover ups, too, like: &lsquo;I got this in prison. Can you fix this for me?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done a lot of those I feel like.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Do you feel like your work is a community service?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t really think of it like that, but it really is, man. You know, just yesterday, my boy had a Raiders tattoo that, you know, the dude&rsquo;s, the Raider face dude was like, was all smushed up. Like, you couldn&rsquo;t see none of the features and&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">couldn&rsquo;t read the letters and I just brought it back. That was like a service to him, making him feel better about hisself something It&rsquo;s like a service. It is a really a service, you know.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">All right. So another comparison or just a question I&rsquo;ve had&hellip; So in the graff world, you go from a tool like learning into scribbles, you know, tagging your name to doing bubble letters and working your way up to, you doing huge murals. Yeah is there a similar chain of command in the tattoo world?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Miguel &ldquo;Bounce&rdquo; Perez: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It&rsquo;s similar in that, um, you definitely got to, like, pay your dues you know to get, like, respected in the industry. You gotta like, you got to apprentice with somebody who&rsquo;s already respected. Before like, recently the game has hella changed And a lot of a lot of those old-heads will say it&rsquo;s f*cked up now because, you know, people are learning how to tattoo off of YouTube and sh*t where as even like ten years ago it&rsquo;s like, literally like like damn near like a f*cking secret society that you had to like. claw and beg to get your way into it. Like a big thing with your apprenticeship is generally not paid. The Apprentice is the one that has to be there on time, has to spend the most hours. You know, has to do like the most like grunt work. And it&rsquo;s like two years before you can even start to like pick up a machine or something. I mean, this is definitely more like the whole school classic way is definitely changing these last couple of years which. It&rsquo;s all f*cked up now with social media. New tattooers would get like one famous client, and then all of a sudden they&rsquo;re, you know, $2,000 an hour. Like damn, your work isn&rsquo;t even that good. It&rsquo;s like a big thing about tattooing is like, you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re doing until you see, like, some sh*t you did like 15 years down the line, you know?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like it can be the prettiest, most detailed thing, but the real test is what&rsquo;s it going to look like 15, 20 years later, you know? Is it going to stay? Is it going to &ndash; are the colors are going to hold up? Are your lines going to fade out. So I think definitely like the old school, the old school tattooers there, they&rsquo;re definitely focused on that more, you know. So I mean, because even before I got into tattooing that traditional style that\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">they call it American Traditional, where it&rsquo;s like. You know, like the real thick lines, kind of simpler drawings, like, you know, the classic images like the panther or, you know, the kind of like the pin-up style ladies and roses.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like a kind of didn&rsquo;t really feel. Before I really knew about tattooing. I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate that stuff that much, you know. But then after I started doing it and really like, &lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a reason why those lines are so thick,&rsquo;, or there&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s so simple because, you know, they want, you know, they want this to look good in 15 years, you know. And this just a. And there&rsquo;s a reason why they make it bold and simple.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Music]\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>Pendarvis Harshaw: \u003c/b>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank you Miguel Bounce Perez!

Further complicating the process were \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63005/exclusive-the-education-department-says-it-will-fix-its-1-8-billion-fafsa-mistake\">glitches \u003c/a>with Social Security numbers and instances where students could not create accounts entirely, which created real panic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The application launched on Dec. 30, 2023, but students from mixed-status families could only complete the application starting March 12.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know how they didn&rsquo;t anticipate that [mixed-status families not being able to apply] was going to be a concern,&rdquo; Shoopman said &mdash; especially in a state like California, where \u003ca href=\"https://immigrantdataca.org/indicators/mixed-status-families?breakdown=by-age-group\">20% of Californians under 18 are either undocumented or living with undocumented family members\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Families, support staff and schools under pressure\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>For David Alvarez, the director of college readiness and success at Alpha Public Schools in San Jos&eacute;, it was &ldquo;the worst financial aid application season that I&rsquo;ve ever experienced&rdquo; in his 15 years in education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I know that us as a team, as well as fellow educators, tried our absolute best to improve completion rates from years to the next,&rdquo; Alvarez said. &ldquo;But the system [this year] didn&rsquo;t really allow for it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alvarez&rsquo;s school has a large number of first-generation and Latino students, he explained. In preparation for the application season, the school prepared FAFSA workshops and early morning hours for seniors to work on their application to provide specialized attention to students &mdash; trying to work around the complications of the form.[aside postID=news_11984551 hero='https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240423-SAT-III-MD-06-KQED-1020x680.jpg']During those workshops, Alvarez managed the growing frustrations of students and their parents. He said some had taken time off work to attend a workshop and faced unanswered questions exacerbated by FAFSA glitches.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The experience has become a nightmare when you realize that applications weren&rsquo;t working properly, that you didn&rsquo;t always have the answers when you were troubleshooting things &hellip; and that created a lot of distrust from students and parents,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Sometimes, they might see it as, &lsquo;Hey, you don&rsquo;t have the answers. You might be incompetent. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rsquo;&rdquo; Alvarez said. &ldquo;And the reality is: It&rsquo;s so much bigger than us.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Our community is losing out on both the time and the money that, let&rsquo;s be real, we didn&rsquo;t really have in the first place to begin with,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Oftentimes, students would question the purpose of even doing the application, Alvarez said. Some four-year eligible students instead planned to go to community college, potentially overloading the community college system, which is unsure who will be attending in the fall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;With a delay in FAFSA, it delayed the ability for schools to present financial aid award letters,&rdquo; Alvarez said. The FAFSA delays also delayed schools&rsquo; ability to present financial aid award letters, Alvarez said &mdash; meaning that &ldquo;ultimately, students and parents can&rsquo;t confidently select the institution that they want to go to &mdash; because they&rsquo;re just unaware of how much money they will receive.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While many states extended their college application deadlines, this led to institutions not knowing who would attend their school in the fall. According to DeBaun, this impacts course schedules, staffing&nbsp;and residential halls.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;There is a limit to how far back institutions can push these deadlines and still be prepared to receive students for the fall semester,&rdquo; he said. Shoopman also said it can keep students on college waitlists in limbo as others consider if they can afford to enroll.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;For students in California, or anywhere in America right now, we should be concerned about what full enrollment would look like based on the FAFSA completion declines that we&rsquo;re seeing,&rdquo; DeBaun&nbsp;said.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Examining the reasons behind FAFSA declines\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>One factor to consider in this year&rsquo;s sharp fall in FAFSA submissions is the record number of applications the state saw last year, according to California State Aid Commission (CSAC) spokesperson Shelveen Ratnam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2023, the agency&rsquo;s widespread \u003ca href=\"https://campussuite-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/1558523/0672826e-a84b-11e7-9779-0ae3e1d9783c/2627890/325d1d6e-1cfb-11ee-b757-02b0137163b1/file/all_in_for_fafsa_ca_dream_act_fact_sheet.pdf\">&ldquo;All in for FAFSA/CA Dream&rdquo; campaign\u003c/a> promoted awareness of FAFSA, encouraging California high schools to have all students fill out an application or actively opt out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like every state that also implemented this policy, California saw a large jump in FAFSA completion numbers last year, DeBaun said. By September 2023, 62% of the class of 2023 had completed the FAFSA &mdash; compared to 58% of the class of 2022 in the same period that year.[aside postID=news_11982354 hero='https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240408-UCLAWSF-014-BL-KQED-1020x680.jpg']States that have traditionally done well with FAFSA completion, like California and Texas, are also seeing major drops this year, DeBaun said. However, for him, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/tag/fafsa\">the delay in this year&rsquo;s FAFSA application\u003c/a> is at least partly responsible for these marked decreases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Think about it this way: Every day, [successful states] are relatively more effective at getting more students to complete a FAFSA than their peers,&rdquo; DeBaun&nbsp;said. &ldquo;So when you take 90 days out of the FAFSA cycle &hellip; every single one of those days, relatively speaking, costs that state more in terms of FAFSA completion.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The class of 2024 [has] just had a much smaller window in which to complete the FAFSA,&rdquo; DeBaun said &mdash; and all the while &mdash; &ldquo;the fall semester isn&rsquo;t getting pushed back.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ratnam described the trend in data &mdash; and the technical difficulties that students faced &mdash; as &ldquo;definitely alarming.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;[Financial aid is] one of the most important things that students or families think about when it comes to deciding if they want to pursue higher education,&rdquo; Ratnam said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Alvarez noted that FAFSA submission numbers have increased in the last weeks, likely helped by the fact that the previous glitches with the form had been fixed, he said that distrust of the process among students and their families is still noticeable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As this winter&rsquo;s initial FAFSA errors might have been resolved, &ldquo;tell that to someone who&rsquo;s come to the high school five, six, seven, eight times already,&rdquo; Alvarez said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s really what we&rsquo;re facing: Just re-energizing the students and the parents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;As difficult as it is, it has long-term impacts, and we want to see the light at the end of the tunnel.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Do students still have time to apply?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>While the May 2 deadline for in-state aid has passed, CSAC is encouraging students to still apply to the FAFSA to see if they qualify for other types of financial aid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://www.csac.ca.gov/post/cal-grant-community-college-entitlement-award\">Cal Grant Community College Entitlement Award FAFSA application\u003c/a> is due on Sept. 2\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alvarez said the FAFSA is often the first college-related struggle students face.

As a construction worker, he had enough gigs to earn more than $500 a week under the table, allowing him to rent a studio for $600 a month with two other Latinx construction workers in San Francisco&rsquo;s Mission District. Despite working nearly full-time, he was barely able to make ends meet. So, when the pandemic hit, Varilla-Aguilar continued working. He got critically sick in December 2020.

The family refused. Hoping for a miracle, Aguilar-Perez talked to her unconscious brother through a hospital monitor via Zoom calls every week. Then, in March 2021, Varilla-Aguilar woke up. &ldquo;When I opened my eyes, it felt like a few days [had passed],&rdquo; Varilla-Aguilar said. &ldquo;But they told me it had been three months &hellip; It was a shock.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_11986483\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 2000px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11986483\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg\" alt=\"A middle-aged Latino man puts on an oxygen mask at home.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1920x1280.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Osbaldo Varilla-Aguilar, 46, puts on the oxygen ventilator he uses every night in San Francisco on Feb. 26, 2024. \u003ccite>(Pablo Unzueta for El Tecolote/CatchLight Local)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Today, more than three years after he was discharged from the hospital, Varilla-Aguilar still depends on the oxygen respirator next to his bed.

However, soon after Donald Trump became president, \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1AW2OY/\">he ended the program\u003c/a>&nbsp;as part of a broad crackdown on immigration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, in 2021, President Joe Biden \u003ca href=\"https://www.state.gov/restarting-the-central-american-minors-program/\">brought it back\u003c/a>, saying CAM &ldquo;reflects our values as a nation&rdquo; by protecting vulnerable children. It was also part of a comprehensive approach to managing the current surge of migration in the Americas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s unclear how many kids have come through CAM since the program restarted because the government has not been forthcoming with data. But the number must be tiny when compared to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters\">the 137,000 unaccompanied minors\u003c/a> encountered at the border last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said more than 800 people have come into the U.S. as refugees under CAM since 2021. In addition, those who don&rsquo;t qualify for \u003ca href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/refugees/refugee-eligibility-determination\">refugee status\u003c/a> (which offers legal permanent residence and eventual citizenship) are considered for a temporary status called \u003ca href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian_parole\">humanitarian parole\u003c/a>. Advocates estimate that roughly twice as many people are approved for parole as refugee status. However, the agency that handles parole, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, declined KQED&rsquo;s request for data on the program.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>The lucky and the not-so-lucky\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>As Diego and Jos&eacute; chased each other around the driveway, Lima stood on her porch and spoke in a hushed voice about the death threats that led her to leave her toddler behind in El Salvador.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Her city, \u003ca href=\"https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/santa-ana-el-salvador/\">Santa Ana, was dominated by gangs\u003c/a>, and her work as a police officer made her a target. After a warning from colleagues, she said, she began moving where she slept &mdash; at the police station, at her parents&rsquo; home &mdash; but gang members tracked her down and threatened her directly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, she said, she turned in her badge and her uniform, scraped together money for a smuggler, and prepared for a risky journey to reach her sister in California.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I knew if I had to run, my older boy could run with me.

But I couldn&rsquo;t carry one in my arms and hold the other by the hand.&rsquo;[/pullquote]Lima got to the U.S. border with Jos&eacute;, passed an initial asylum screening and moved in with her sister in East Palo Alto. After six months, she qualified for a work permit and began delivering pizzas, then waitressing, she said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jos&eacute; was thriving in school and learning English, Lima said, but without Diego, she fell into a depression. Then, a friend showed her a YouTube video about the Central American Minors program. She jotted down the phone number and called the next morning. She applied in November of 2022, and 10 months later, she met Diego at the airport.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It was incredibly fast,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other parents have not been so lucky.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Elda Coreas, a construction worker in Virginia, applied to the CAM program in 2016 to bring her son from El Salvador. She said she had left him with family as a little boy years earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Coreas&rsquo;s son, Ricardo, was approved for parole. She paid for his plane ticket, and he packed his bag, she said. Then, in 2017, President Trump abruptly shut the program down. An official called and told her Ricardo could not come.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I felt as if the sky had fallen,&rdquo; Coreas said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to tell him.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, the International Refugee Assistance Program sued the Trump administration on behalf of families like hers. And in 2019, a judge ordered the government to admit the more than 2,800 people, including Ricardo, who had already been approved when CAM was terminated.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since then, 1,769 of them have arrived in the U.S., and just 107 cases remain pending, though hundreds of others have simply been closed, \u003ca href=\"https://refugeerights.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ECF-124-20th-Quarterly-Report.pdf\">according to a court-ordered update last month (PDF)\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Eventually, Coreas&rsquo;s case was reopened. Though Ricardo is now an adult with a degree in computer engineering, he was still eligible to join her, and he again went through interviews, background checks and a physical exam. Coreas said last November officials told her Ricardo was qualified and that they would notify him of his travel date. But she said they&rsquo;ve heard nothing since.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;So many years of waiting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They give you hope, then they take it away. They&rsquo;re treating us as if we were toys.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tatiana M&eacute;ndez with the International Rescue Committee, which is assisting Coreas with her case, said it&rsquo;s unclear what&rsquo;s causing the delay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>&lsquo;A political football&rsquo;\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Advocates said the relaunch of the CAM program has been slowed by the fact that refugee resettlement agencies, which assist parents in filing applications, are only now rebuilding after losing funding and staff when Trump drastically cut the U.S. refugee program.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The other issue, after so much political back-and-forth, has simply been getting the word out that the program exists &mdash; and convincing parents that applying is worth their trouble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Frankly, a lot of folks who are now eligible may not even be aware that the program exists,&rdquo; said Michelle Villegas, an attorney with Kids in Need of Defense.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Villegas&rsquo; organization received a grant from the U.S. State Department to raise awareness of CAM through outreach to legal service providers, schools, clinics and churches in the U.S. and in Central America.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Part of the challenge she said she faces is rebuilding trust with those who do know about CAM because the program has had so many stops and starts. She said word travels about cases like Coreas&rsquo;.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s the reality that many immigration policies are political footballs,&rdquo; Villegas said. &ldquo;And CAM is one of these programs that is affected by the policies of different administrations.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Villegas and other supporters believe that, given time and consistency, the CAM program could grow to be a humane and effective tool for making a dent in illegal border crossings. However, political football is still being tossed about, and what will happen in the future is unclear.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Confronted with a global migration crisis and record numbers of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, Biden has used parole programs liberally. However, parole &mdash; including through CAM &mdash; has become increasingly controversial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a campaign video, Trump said that, if elected, he would &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-no-welfare-for-illegal-aliens\">stop the outrageous abuse of parole authority.\u003c/a>&rdquo; His press secretary wouldn&rsquo;t say whether Trump would terminate CAM a second time, but advocates on both the right and the left believe he would.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., which advocates for reducing immigration, expects Trump would end CAM because, he said, its parole provisions overstep presidential power.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Parole is supposed to be a narrow emergency power. And this administration, in particular, has used it as a kind of blank check,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The CAM program, regardless of whom it benefits, is illegitimate in itself. Now, Congress could create a program like that if they wanted to, but they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, the CAM program is also being challenged \u003ca href=\"https://refugeerights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/March-14-2022-Amended-Complaint.pdf\">in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Texas and other Republican-led states (PDF)\u003c/a>. Lawyers for parents who&rsquo;ve intervened in the suit have \u003ca href=\"https://refugeerights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ECF-124-Defendant-Intervenors-MTD-1.pdf\">asked the federal judge to dismiss the case (PDF)\u003c/a>, saying the states don&rsquo;t have standing to challenge the program. The judge heard that argument in January and could rule at any time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hannah Flamm, a policy counsel with the International Refugee Assistance Program, said the migrant journey across Mexico remains extremely dangerous, so lawful pathways for kids are crucial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;For many of these families, there is no alternative,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So maintaining and improving the Central American Minors program is the only way that the United States can offer a meaningful alternative to the dangerous journey that many children undertake&hellip; due to their circumstances.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_11984330\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 2000px\">\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/norma-lima-and-her-son-diego-6-in-menlo-park-on-apr-28-2024-2/\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11984330\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED.jpg\" alt=\"woman pushes a kid in a swing\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/240429-CENTRAL-AMERICAN-MINORS-MD-08-KQED-1920x1280.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\u003c/a>\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Norma Lima and her son Diego, 6, in Menlo Park. \u003ccite>(Martin do Nascimento/KQED)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003ch2>A safe alternative\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Norma Lima didn&rsquo;t want to risk her little boy&rsquo;s life with a smuggler, yet the separation was unbearable.

However, soon after Donald Trump became president, \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1AW2OY/\">he ended the program\u003c/a>&nbsp;as part of a broad crackdown on immigration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, in 2021, President Joe Biden \u003ca href=\"https://www.state.gov/restarting-the-central-american-minors-program/\">brought it back\u003c/a>, saying CAM &ldquo;reflects our values as a nation&rdquo; by protecting vulnerable children. It was also part of a comprehensive approach to managing the current surge of migration in the Americas.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s unclear how many kids have come through CAM since the program restarted because the government has not been forthcoming with data. But the number must be tiny when compared to \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters\">the 137,000 unaccompanied minors\u003c/a> encountered at the border last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said more than 800 people have come into the U.S. as refugees under CAM since 2021. In addition, those who don&rsquo;t qualify for \u003ca href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/refugees/refugee-eligibility-determination\">refugee status\u003c/a> (which offers legal permanent residence and eventual citizenship) are considered for a temporary status called \u003ca href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian_parole\">humanitarian parole\u003c/a>.

Then, a friend showed her a YouTube video about the Central American Minors program. She jotted down the phone number and called the next morning. She applied in November of 2022, and 10 months later, she met Diego at the airport.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It was incredibly fast,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other parents have not been so lucky.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Elda Coreas, a construction worker in Virginia, applied to the CAM program in 2016 to bring her son from El Salvador.

And this administration, in particular, has used it as a kind of blank check,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The CAM program, regardless of whom it benefits, is illegitimate in itself. Now, Congress could create a program like that if they wanted to, but they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, the CAM program is also being challenged \u003ca href=\"https://refugeerights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/March-14-2022-Amended-Complaint.pdf\">in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Texas and other Republican-led states (PDF)\u003c/a>.
