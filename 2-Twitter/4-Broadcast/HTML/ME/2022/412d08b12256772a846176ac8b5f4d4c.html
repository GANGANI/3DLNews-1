After almost a year with the station, she decided to try her skills in front of the camera and crossed over into the reporting realm in September of 2022. \n\nKaddie is a North Carolina native. After living in various parts of NC; Charlotte, Asheville, the Triangle Area, just to name a few, she and her husband were ready for a new adventure. So, in May of 2021, they moved to Bangor. Kaddie got her Communication and Theatre degree from Appalachian State University and worked at the college's radio station while in school. While focusing in radio, she also did an internship at Clear Channel Radio in Charlotte, NC. After college, she worked in a few different fields from beer to software, and eventually made her way back to her first love of broadcasting. \n\nWhen she’s not reporting the news, she’s making jewelry, cooking with her husband, playing with her precious pugs, or watching horror movies.\n\nShe also has had the great opportunity to continue acting up here, in Maine. She keeps busy with various film and voiceover projects with local production groups.\n\nKaddie loves all the seasons in Maine, meeting the people, and seeing all that the beautiful state has to offer. She and her husband often say to each other, “I’m so glad we moved here.”","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wabi","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"12","last_updated_date":"2023-07-12T21:02:37.065Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:41:14.498Z","description":{"basic":"RSU

Forced to confront a lost childhood on the reservation, a love affair cut short, and the death of his beloved stepfather, Fredrick, in a hunting accident—a death he and Louise are at odds over as to where to lay blame—Charles contends with questions he’s long been afraid to ask. Is his secret about Elizabeth his to share? And would his daughter want to know the truth, even if it could cost her everything she’s ever known?</i>"},{"_id":"WF6NTISTQFFJJFFCWKZPKCKEM4","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717090838697,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Talty is a citizen of the Penobscot Indian Nation.

She grew up with the love of sports, thanks to her parents who are major sports fans. \n\nShe began to play tennis at 5 years old and loved it so much that she played at the collegiate level at Newberry College in South Carolina. During her four years as a wolf, Sierra realized her love for communications. She’s always enjoyed writing, whether it’s long stories or poetry, but producing an actual news story became her passion after she did a Sports Broadcasting internship at a local news station in Charleston.\n\nSierra took her love for the broadcasting world to Chicago and entered a Master’s program at DePaul University for Journalism. She had the opportunity to work with professors working in the Chicago market, interned at NBC Sports Chicago and truly learned the in’s and outs of producing good content.\n\nAfter graduating in March 2020, Sierra moved to Rhinelander, Wisconsin to begin her career in journalism. She started out as a reporter for WJFW and then advanced to a Morning Anchor position which gave her the opportunity to connect with community members, discuss local events and produce long-form stories to highlight local community members.\n\nShe was fortunate enough to continue that career here at WABI with awesome team members as an evening anchor and reporter. Sierra is a Boston Celtics, and Bruins fan, however, the Steelers are her football team. (Don’t worry, the Patriots is still a top team in her household)\n\nIf you have any story ideas, please reach out to

","longBio":"As a Charleston, SC native, Sierra Whaley always enjoyed the outdoors from the beach to walking trails. She grew up with the love of sports, thanks to her parents who are major sports fans. \n\nShe began to play tennis at 5 years old and loved it so much that she played at the collegiate level at Newberry College in South Carolina. During her four years as a wolf, Sierra realized her love for communications. She’s always enjoyed writing, whether it’s long stories or poetry, but producing an actual news story became her passion after she did a Sports Broadcasting internship at a local news station in Charleston.\n\nSierra took her love for the broadcasting world to Chicago and entered a Master’s program at DePaul University for Journalism. She had the opportunity to work with professors working in the Chicago market, interned at NBC Sports Chicago and truly learned the in’s and outs of producing good content.\n\nAfter graduating in March 2020, Sierra moved to Rhinelander, Wisconsin to begin her career in journalism. She started out as a reporter for WJFW and then advanced to a Morning Anchor position which gave her the opportunity to connect with community members, discuss local events and produce long-form stories to highlight local community members.\n\nShe was fortunate enough to continue that career here at WABI with awesome team members as an evening anchor and reporter. Sierra is a Boston Celtics, and Bruins fan, however, the Steelers are her football team. (Don’t worry, the Patriots is still a top team in her household)\n\nIf you have any story ideas, please reach out to
