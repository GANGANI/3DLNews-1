After transitioning from the service, Brian began working for WAGM-TV in Presque Isle, Maine as a multimedia journalist on August 23rd, 2021. \n\nHis hobbies include audio/video production, songwriting, tabletop role playing games, and spending time with his children, friends and family. \n\nBrian has two regular weekly segments, Throwback Thursday (Thursday Evenings @ 6pm) and Sledding the County (Friday Evenings @ 6pm, Mid December to Late March ). \n\nThrowback Thursday digs into the paper records and vintage tape archives of WAGM dating as far back as 1981. Each segment highlights a report by a former WAGM reporter, and encourages the audience to contemplate how the news of yesterday affects our lives today. Throwback Thursday was developed in conjunction with Corey Bouchard's segment, Follow Up Friday, which picks up where Throwback Thursday left off with a look at the current state of Throwback Thursday's topic or subject.\n\nSledding the County, which is currently in it's fifth season, is a look at snowmobiling as a sport, tourism, social and economic impacts, safety tips, experiences, events, VIP visits and important messages to the snowmobiling community. The segment is augmented by the Facebook Group, Sledding the County, which is operated by Mike McNulty, who has been the driving force in developing the segment since its creation. Sledding the County is Sponsored by The Sled Shop, Inc.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wagm","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-23T12:31:44.941Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","expertise":"Investigative Journalism, Daily News, Energy and Electricity, Technology, History, Military and Veterans","languages":"English","linkedin":"brian-bouchard-1011","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BrianBouchardWAGM","beat":"Investigative Reporting"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T19:03:33.213Z","description":{"basic":"With the housing market presenting numerous challenges, younger generations may find themselves questioning if homeownership is within their reach.

In Maine, the weather can differ so much from day to day and from the daytime to the nighttime. Having fire making materials in case you do have to end up spending the night in the woods. We always suggest dressing in layers. You can take some of those layers off so that you don’t overheat but if it gets cool at night you have the layers to stay warm. Something else too is doing the research of where you’re going ahead of time. If you’re deciding to go on a hike up a mountain you’ve got to consider that the weather conditions may change upon the elevation. If you’re going somewhere really remote like the North Maine Woods it’s always a good idea to have some sort of satellite phone or GPS spot locator.”"},{"_id":"DU3R4AUTR5BXDJIHM5KBY377PQ","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717083810580,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Even with precautionary measures you could still get lost.

He says that way if you do get lost there is a general area to begin the search. “You certainly want to let people know where you’re gonna be. Always live up to that point what you told them. Because if you don’t return, they’re gonna go looking for you there. If you don’t tell somebody, just put a slip of paper in your dashboard indicating that I’m hiking and I’m going up to the tower and that way there is something to indicate where you’re gonna be. Hiking’s a great and wonderful activity it’s a great way to relieve stress but there are things you need to think about while going out and exploring the trails. One should know their limitations. You want to condition yourself. Work up to that point where you can meet your goals and do it safely.” Thompson says folks can find local accessible trails at <a href=\"http://www.mainetrailfinder.com/\">www.mainetrailfinder.com</a>.

After transitioning from the service, Brian began working for WAGM-TV in Presque Isle, Maine as a multimedia journalist on August 23rd, 2021. \n\nHis hobbies include audio/video production, songwriting, tabletop role playing games, and spending time with his children, friends and family. \n\nBrian has two regular weekly segments, Throwback Thursday (Thursday Evenings @ 6pm) and Sledding the County (Friday Evenings @ 6pm, Mid December to Late March ). \n\nThrowback Thursday digs into the paper records and vintage tape archives of WAGM dating as far back as 1981. Each segment highlights a report by a former WAGM reporter, and encourages the audience to contemplate how the news of yesterday affects our lives today. Throwback Thursday was developed in conjunction with Corey Bouchard's segment, Follow Up Friday, which picks up where Throwback Thursday left off with a look at the current state of Throwback Thursday's topic or subject.\n\nSledding the County, which is currently in it's fifth season, is a look at snowmobiling as a sport, tourism, social and economic impacts, safety tips, experiences, events, VIP visits and important messages to the snowmobiling community. The segment is augmented by the Facebook Group, Sledding the County, which is operated by Mike McNulty, who has been the driving force in developing the segment since its creation. Sledding the County is Sponsored by The Sled Shop, Inc.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wagm","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-23T12:31:44.941Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","expertise":"Investigative Journalism, Daily News, Energy and Electricity, Technology, History, Military and Veterans","languages":"English","linkedin":"brian-bouchard-1011","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BrianBouchardWAGM","beat":"Investigative Reporting"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T18:03:53.465Z","description":{"basic":"In Throwback Thursday, we explored how baby boomers faced similar challenges in mental health and substance use as millennials and Generation Z do today.

ISLE, Maine (WAGM) -Today is Memorial Day, a day where we honor and mourn military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. The city of Caribou held some events including a Memorial Day parade, and residents were lining the streets. With roads closed off temporarily for the parade Caribou saw residents walking quite a way to watch the procession. The parade began at the Caribou Courthouse, making its way around Caribou and ended at the Veterans Memorial Park with a small ceremony. Veteran Wayne Little said, “Today is a scared day for all of our fallen brothers. It’s a celebration of their victory and the honor that they did. They are heroes and we wouldn’t be enjoying the freedom that we have today if it wasn’t for our fallen brothers that have gone on before us and we honor them.”"},{"_id":"UDP5GS7ZQNE3PCMMOKVOK66T74","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1716908841291,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Patrick Beaulieu, another Veteran at the parade said, “It means a lot to have people come and just acknowledge that these people fought for their country, for the constitution.

Wanda Smith, Chaplain of Caribou’s American Legion said, “It’s usually a pretty big turnout here at the cemetery. We all have family members, friends who didn’t come home. It is very hard because a lot of people lost people and it brings up a lot of sad memories. So, it’s very important that we all get out and remember those who didn’t come home. It’s always very windy here at the cemetery maybe more so than it is in other places and it’s just kind of become a folklore that the wind here is the breath of the soldiers. The military has kept us safe and that’s due in part to soldiers. So, we should be very thankful.” Smith says folks wanting to show support for these lives lost can help by buying and placing poppies on the graves at the veteran’s cemetery, giving donations to local veteran’s organizations, or simply by checking in on a veteran."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"ktriplett","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Karri Triplett","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/e02c7045-d910-40a5-b572-5e34a5042819.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Karri was born in Fort Hood, Texas but spent her early childhood in Collettsville, North Carolina.

ISLE, Maine (WAGM) -RSU 39′s budget meeting took place on Wednesday night, discussing potential cuts and what effects these cuts may have on the school district. The budget meeting on May 22nd went over the district’s budget for 2025 and took place at the Caribou Performing Arts Center. Many residents and school faculty members showed up to discuss potential cuts to teaching positions, courses offered, and extra curriculars.

Our new school was built to hold 20 children in each classroom and if we are to cut a teaching position then we’ll start cramming and overcrowding children into classrooms that were not meant to hold that many. There was some great upset at the last meeting when it was shared that that sixth-grade position was going to be cut. I know some parents who were very concerned about their children being crammed into three classrooms instead of four. The academic needs of this fifth-grade class going into sixth grade are great and so it doesn’t make sense to me to cut a teacher.”"},{"_id":"YUL23PLQJZEJDA6U6SLMX3NS5Q","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1716581356673,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"After some discussion an amendment was made to the budget to add back 90,000 dollars.

Lindsey Theriault, one of the school board members commented, “You can make an amendment to the dollar amount. There are no specific requests that you can make for staffing positions. That is only for a dollar amount.” This sixth-grade teaching position as well as a nurse, the assistant superintendent, an IT technician, gifted and talented staff, and many others will be cut with the current proposed budget."},{"_id":"ET3BCGPYHBDQXBP55COL6ZPCIA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1716581356674,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Bourgeois, “Originally, they had planned on cutting around 18 positions from the school and that was very disturbing to hear. That was when I started to get involved and trying to figure out how we could make some changes for the better. These decisions impact my children and so I wanted to have a voice in the matter. This is certainly not my forte and I am not a public speaker. But it just was very important to me because of my children, and the children that I used to serve as a teacher, and the children that I see every day at the school when I go and drop my kiddos off, and I just felt they needed a voice.” Residents are encouraged to come out and vote on the budget on June 11th from 8am to 8pm at the Caribou Wellness Center."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"ktriplett","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Karri Triplett","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/e02c7045-d910-40a5-b572-5e34a5042819.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Karri was born in Fort Hood, Texas but spent her early childhood in Collettsville, North Carolina.

Every year, Brian and his family would make the 5 hour drive from South Paris, Maine to Van Buren, and the County always felt like a 2nd home. \n\nBrian is a veteran of the United States Army, and is a former Paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and Drill Sergeant facilitating Basic Combat Training in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. After transitioning from the service, Brian began working for WAGM-TV in Presque Isle, Maine as a multimedia journalist on August 23rd, 2021. \n\nHis hobbies include audio/video production, songwriting, tabletop role playing games, and spending time with his children, friends and family. \n\nBrian has two regular weekly segments, Throwback Thursday (Thursday Evenings @ 6pm) and Sledding the County (Friday Evenings @ 6pm, Mid December to Late March ). \n\nThrowback Thursday digs into the paper records and vintage tape archives of WAGM dating as far back as 1981. Each segment highlights a report by a former WAGM reporter, and encourages the audience to contemplate how the news of yesterday affects our lives today. Throwback Thursday was developed in conjunction with Corey Bouchard's segment, Follow Up Friday, which picks up where Throwback Thursday left off with a look at the current state of Throwback Thursday's topic or subject.\n\nSledding the County, which is currently in it's fifth season, is a look at snowmobiling as a sport, tourism, social and economic impacts, safety tips, experiences, events, VIP visits and important messages to the snowmobiling community. The segment is augmented by the Facebook Group, Sledding the County, which is operated by Mike McNulty, who has been the driving force in developing the segment since its creation. Sledding the County is Sponsored by The Sled Shop, Inc.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wagm","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-23T12:31:44.941Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","expertise":"Investigative Journalism, Daily News, Energy and Electricity, Technology, History, Military and Veterans","languages":"English","linkedin":"brian-bouchard-1011","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BrianBouchardWAGM","beat":"Investigative Reporting"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-24T01:57:53.647Z","description":{"basic":"According to Mental Health America, over 1/5th of all Americans, over 50 million people experience mental health issues on average each year.

You are offered certain exemptions. Things like contacting emergency dispatch in the case of an emergency but it’s a pretty no-nonsense law that if you’re accessing a mobile phone or any kind of device while operating a motor vehicle it is a citation.” Varnum says devices with Bluetooth can be used but any device requiring more than a single touch is prohibited. “I’ve seen laptop computers, gaming devices, people watching TikTok’s. Things like maps are not an issue as long as they’re mounted to the vehicle and you’re not actively punching in an address. You are required to pull over anytime you’re using a mobile device. If your phone is mounted on your dashboard, you are able to swipe to answer. However, you’re not allowed to do anything more than that. \""},{"_id":"W43SIRP3FJE3NFL75ZYRJYRMOA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1716496600054,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"With so many apps and uses for our mobile devices today it is easy to get distracted and if an officer sees you driving on a public road while on your phone they will pull you over. Varnum, “Things like red lights, you’re not allowed to use your phone. But if you’re in a parking lot, in a drive-through line, you’re not going to get a citation. On first offense it’s a fine of no less than 250 dollars and that’s for specifically texting and driving. I believe right now the fine is 325 dollars and then a second offense can lead up to a suspension of your license. There’s a lot of construction going on, so we have a lot of pedestrians. Someone who’s looking down at their phone, not paying attention, obviously the risk is there with taking your eyes off the road. There’s going to be a parade occurring on Monday for Memorial Day. So, someone who’s not paying attention, with heavy change in traffic flow, might hit a pedestrian or might hit another vehicle.” According to the Maine D.O.T., distracted drivers caused 2.906 crashes in Maine in 2023 which resulted in thirteen deaths. The police recommend loading any GPS directions prior to starting your drive and staying off your phone while operating your vehicle for everyone’s safety."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"ktriplett","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Karri Triplett","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/e02c7045-d910-40a5-b572-5e34a5042819.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Karri was born in Fort Hood, Texas but spent her early childhood in Collettsville, North Carolina.

Every year, Brian and his family would make the 5 hour drive from South Paris, Maine to Van Buren, and the County always felt like a 2nd home. \n\nBrian is a veteran of the United States Army, and is a former Paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and Drill Sergeant facilitating Basic Combat Training in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. After transitioning from the service, Brian began working for WAGM-TV in Presque Isle, Maine as a multimedia journalist on August 23rd, 2021. \n\nHis hobbies include audio/video production, songwriting, tabletop role playing games, and spending time with his children, friends and family. \n\nBrian has two regular weekly segments, Throwback Thursday (Thursday Evenings @ 6pm) and Sledding the County (Friday Evenings @ 6pm, Mid December to Late March ). \n\nThrowback Thursday digs into the paper records and vintage tape archives of WAGM dating as far back as 1981. Each segment highlights a report by a former WAGM reporter, and encourages the audience to contemplate how the news of yesterday affects our lives today. Throwback Thursday was developed in conjunction with Corey Bouchard's segment, Follow Up Friday, which picks up where Throwback Thursday left off with a look at the current state of Throwback Thursday's topic or subject.\n\nSledding the County, which is currently in it's fifth season, is a look at snowmobiling as a sport, tourism, social and economic impacts, safety tips, experiences, events, VIP visits and important messages to the snowmobiling community. The segment is augmented by the Facebook Group, Sledding the County, which is operated by Mike McNulty, who has been the driving force in developing the segment since its creation. Sledding the County is Sponsored by The Sled Shop, Inc.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wagm","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-23T12:31:44.941Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","expertise":"Investigative Journalism, Daily News, Energy and Electricity, Technology, History, Military and Veterans","languages":"English","linkedin":"brian-bouchard-1011","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BrianBouchardWAGM","beat":"Investigative Reporting"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-22T16:11:17.581Z","description":{"basic":"In this Intervention Aroostook, Brian Bouchard learns about a new recovery center in Fort Kent, and it’s role as a resource center in the St. John Valley."},"headlines":{"basic":"Intervention Aroostook -

While the Northern Lights lit up the sky, some experienced minor electrical issues due to the geomagnetic storm.

This current event actually caused radio wave blackouts and GPS damage down in the Caribbean and in Mexico so that ships were not able to tell directions and they weren’t able to communicate via radio. In the 1970′s Toronto got hit by one. Lost many of its transformers and some places were without power for two months. In 1859 there was a huge display and it actually caused telegraph machines to shock the people who were working them. Telegraphs were the largest electrical devices back in those days and they were actually able to turn off their machines’ electricity and still be able to send messages because there was so much electricity stored up in the lines. The solar material that gets sent to the Earth also contains quite a bit of radiation. So, astronauts when they’re in space actually have to protect themselves. It’s not like the fantastic four where they get superpowers.
