Interning under Richard Luterman at WJBK in Detroit and learning the television basics from his high school TPW teacher Roger Smith, Matt has established a strong foundation for a career in television.\n\nAs a student of Valparaiso University in northern Indiana, Matt received his bachelor's degree in both meteorology and television/radio where he learned about the business firsthand from current ABC News meteorologist Ginger Zee. If not deriving the Omega equation, he was found frequently chasing storms and tornadoes for the Valparaiso University Storm Intercept team (VUSIT) or broadcasting Valpo athletics for the college radio station, WVUR.\n\nFrom wine in Paris, deadly heights at the Cliffs of Moher, to cruising the Greek Islands, he has learned the importance of experiencing different places and cultures. If not in the First Alert Weather Center, Matt is either enjoying Notre Dame Football or any of the Detroit sports teams.

Murrow Award and National Association of Broadcasters Service to America Award.  The Indiana Broadcasters Association presented WNDU with a Cardinal Community Service Award and Spectrum Award. The series was nominated for an Emmy in 2019. \n\nWNDU hired Sloma in 1993 as a reporter and shortly after, she became the anchor of WNDU’s morning show, a position she still holds to this day. A seven-time Emmy nominee, Sloma won the Emmy for current affairs programming in 2018 for an in-depth report on child abuse. \n\nHer television career began as a production assistant and reporter for the nationally syndicated agricultural news program, AgDay. The show is produced by WNDU-TV.  \n\nSloma is passionate about helping children succeed.  She hosts a weekly segment on WNDU that helps place foster children with adoptive families.  Education and health stories are also her frequent assignments. \n\nTricia and her husband Tom have two grown daughters.  Gardening, travel, art and outdoor activities are Sloma’s favorite hobbies.
