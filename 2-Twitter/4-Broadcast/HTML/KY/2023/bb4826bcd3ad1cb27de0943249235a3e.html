He won a speech competition in \"broadcasting\" and from that moment, he knew he wanted to work in the news business.\n\nHis career started in radio news in Danville, Ky., and he then worked for stations in London, Stanford, and back in Lexington. After a short stint as a newspaper reporter, Phil joined the news team at our sister station WKYT in 2003.\n\n\"I've worked in all three mediums: print, radio, and now television, but I must say, I enjoy television the most,\" says Phil. \"However, in today's world with the internet and social media, you just about do all three now, anyway.\"\n\nPhil mainly covers the western region of the WYMT viewing area but you'll also see him covering the General Assembly when Kentucky's lawmakers make their annual trek to Frankfort each year.\n\nPhil is a big UK basketball fan and was thrilled to be able to cover Cats fans during some recent tournament trips, including the Final Four. Phil also won the Associated Press best continuing news award for his coverage of Kentuckians helping Hurricane Katrina victims in Mississippi in 2005.\n\n\"Someone told me my stories of Kentuckians helping others deal with disaster is what they think I do the best,\" said Phil. \"I really love traveling to places and highlighting events that bring out the best in people,\" he said.\n\nWhen he's not crisscrossing the state covering news, Phil enjoys spending time with his wife and three children. He's active in his church and in his spare time enjoys golf, movies, and going to concerts.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-04-01T04:28:38.585Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wymt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"5"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:54:34.862Z","description":{"basic":"Austin Wethington was one of two people killed in a head-on crash Wednesday near Danville.

There, she covered stories like the death of the infamous Whitey Bulger. \n\nShe then chose to be closer to the beach and spent 3.5 years at WTOC in Savannah, Georgia as an anchor/reporter. During her time in Savannah, she got to cover national stories including the Murdaugh murders and the search and recovery of Quinton Simon. She also covered the city's biggest event, which is the St. Patrick's Day Parade, and was honored to be nominated and chosen to fly with the United States Navy Blue Angels. She said it was an experience she'll never forget! \n\nThough Mariah's family is in Pittsburgh, PA, she didn't come to Kentucky alone. She is here with her four-legged, 82-pound dog, Milo. When she's not working Mariah loves to dance, teach dance and exercise. She's excited to experience the community in Lexington and learn how to ride a horse! \n\nIf you have any story suggestions feel free to send them her way to mariah.congedo@wkyt.com.

Ben graduated from Virginia Tech in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology and a minor in Geography.\n\nWhile in college, Ben completed several internships, including at WRIC in Richmond, Virginia, and also at their sister station WVVA in Bluefield, West Virginia. At WVVA, Ben made his first appearance on television doing the weather. Ben also was a volunteer one summer for the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Virginia, and also did forecasts for Hokie Weather Watch, a student meteorology club at Virginia Tech.\n\nAfter Ben graduated college, he immediately started working at his first station, WHIZ in Zanesville, Ohio. He served as the evening meteorologist for WHIZ for 6 months. The next stop on Ben's journey was sister station WHSV in Harrisonburg, Virginia. He worked at WHSV for three years, starting at the beginning of 2020, doing the weekend weather for the station. While at WHSV, Ben also did weather reporting and general news reporting.\n\nBen watches a lot of sports in his downtime and loves his Washington DC sports teams and Virginia Tech Hokies. He likes to travel and hike when he gets the opportunity. A fun fact about Ben is that he lived in NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin's old childhood home. His parents actually bought the house from the Hamlin family.\n\nBen is excited to be in Kentucky forecasting the weather and is looking forward to learning more about the area.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wkyt","last_updated_date":"2024-03-07T22:06:23.964Z","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/benbeddoeswx/","twitter":"BenWKYT","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/BenWKYT","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T19:24:51.244Z","description":{"basic":"The

My parents tell stories of me standing at a window watching thunderstorms and snowstorms for hours on end. This at the age of two! My fascination with weather continued to grow over the years. I remember going to my local library in Salyersville, where I grew up, and checking out every weather book they had. When I was a fifth grader, my quest to become a Television Meteorologist began. That's when I was selected as a weather watcher for my hometown. The person who selected me... none other than our late friend Brian Collins.\n\nMy work career has been all over the place. I started my meteorology career doing weekend weather at WKYT-TV in 1998. After a few years on weekends, I moved to the noon and 5:30 shows on weekdays. After 6 years of that, the WKYT morning show came calling and I stayed on it for a few years. I also became the first co-host of The Fox 56 Morning Edition.\n\nIt was at this point I took a leave of absence from WKYT to join WSAZ in Huntington, WV. I spent nearly 4 years there before returning to WKYT as Chief Meteorologist. I also took on double duty as the chief meteorologist for FOX 56. Told ya I have worked every shift possible!\n\nWhen I’m not doing weather, chances are you will find me cheering on my favorite sports teams. I’m a HUGE Kentucky Wildcats fan and bleed blue! I also love my Cincinnati Reds and Bengals.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wkyt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2020-09-02T03:06:24.717Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","twitter":"@kentuckyweather","personal_website":"https://kyweathercenter.com/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ChrisBaileyWKYT/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T18:35:55.427Z","description":{"basic":"A

Fearing my parents would be deported, as a child, I turned to news broadcasting to keep me updated on the immigration and deportation climate. It was then that I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up: a reporter.\nYears later, I am fulfilling that dream.\nPrior to joining the FOX19 NOW team, I worked as a multimedia journalist for CAN-TV Chicago. My work primarily focused on covering underserved communities in the city’s south side. Because of this work, I was given the opportunity to act as a national correspondent and travel to the border city of El Paso, Texas to cover the migrant crisis following the expiration of Title 42.\nIn addition to that work, I also produced two short-form documentaries. My first documentary titled, “The Perilous Journey To The American Dream” was published by the Illinois Latino News Network and later played in a Chicago theater. My second documentary titled, “Somos Venezolanos” was part of a collaboration, and was produced in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This documentary focused primarily on immigration within Latin American countries.\nWhen I am not watching or covering the news you can find me at a thrift store hunting for that one-of-a-kind find or at home doing a puzzle.\nI am very excited to begin my on-air reporting career in the Cincinnati/Tri-State area and look forward to using my skills and experience to share impactful stories from those in this community.\nIf you have a story idea, feel free to send me an email at brenda.ordonez@fox19now.com or reach me on social media.\nSi tiene una idea para una historia, no dude en enviarme un correo electrónico a brenda.ordonez@fox19now.com o a mis medios de comunicacion social.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-05-15T18:25:48.014Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wxix","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"22","twitter":"https://twitter.com/BrendaOrdonezTV","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=brenda%20ordonez%20tv"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:53:53.102Z","description":{"basic":"Micah Price had his diploma withheld after he went off-script during a graduation speech"},"headlines":{"basic":"Kentucky high school grad says controversial speech cost him his diploma","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/_D-zZPlFsG4BDL6laVbPQ4EzK8s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM.jpeg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"IMG_1944.jpeg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM.jpeg","owner":"bj.bethel@fox19now.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/_D-zZPlFsG4BDL6laVbPQ4EzK8s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM.jpeg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/_D-zZPlFsG4BDL6laVbPQ4EzK8s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM.jpeg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/eQKVmL9thruk2a5qTt7fUVMNlck=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/QY2WJXCOFRDNNM6F22KNXRF7UM.jpeg","usage_instructions":"FREE TO USE","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"b095d39ee0d323ff48770d0c8030b0474dc6c8b8299a6ca93d243f5cdcf11e34"},"caption":"Micah Price received his graduation diploma on Wednesday, May 29, 2024 from Campbell County High School.

WRLV AM/FM in his hometown of Salyersville wanted a student to come by and record a couple of promos that kept the community up to date on school news.\n“From that point on I wanted to be in communications whether it was radio or television. I uncovered a passion for broadcasting that I couldn't deny,” said Caldwell. “So, no more medical field for me. I had found a new love.”\n\nWhen he turned 16, Caldwell was given another opportunity to get into the broadcasting field early. His high school electricity teacher was asked to do play-by-play for the Magoffin County Hornets. He asked Caldwell to be his color commentator and statistician.\n\n“That was the break that I needed because just as soon as the season ended I was offered a job at the station,” Caldwell said.\nHis very first job was recording the evening weather and recording some commercials. On a daily basis, he only put in two or three hours a day after school. Before he knew it, he was doing everything from cleaning the station, taking out the trash, dabbling in sales, writing commercials, or washing the station vehicle.\n\nDuring all of the juggling of numerous duties, he was also on the air live everyday from 3 to 6 p.m. and all weekend weather was on his shoulders. “I was given a few titles while there. The first was sports director in 1999 and in 2000 I became music director” said Caldwell.\nThe whole time he was working at WRLV, he was also finishing high school and beginning the first part of his college career at Prestonsburg Community College (now known as Big Sandy Community & Technical College). One cold February day in 2001, Caldwell received a phone call from Tony Turner that would change the course of his life again. “He asked me to come over to WYMT and interview for the chief weathercaster position,” Caldwell said.\n\n“All through school and in life weather was always interesting. I had studied it and I admit it had always been a passion of mine, and I really looked forward to the chance to put my knowledge to the test. In late February 2001 I made my third trip ever to the city of Hazard. This time I was here to try for my chance in television. Little did I know that it wouldn't be the last,” said Caldwell.\n\nCaldwell started work at WYMT on March 12, 2001.\nIn March 2003, Caldwell became a member of the American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association. He received his Broadcast Meteorology Certificate from Mississippi State University.\n\nIn June 2013, he made the decision to become a part of the WKYT First Alert Weather team after spending more than 12 years at WYMT.\n“I was fortunate to marry my best friend in this entire world. Terri and I have been together for years so why not tie the knot? I have two sons. The oldest is Caleb and Carsyn Storm. Caleb may be my step-son, but he's just as much mine as he is Terri's,” said Caldwell.\n\n“I used to say, Give me an XBOX One, any of the Halo franchise, Call of Duty, and I will be awake for a month. That has changed as I have gotten older. Now, I let Storm do all the gaming and I do all the watching and sleeping.\"","slug":"","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-caldwell-192974142/","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"expertise":"Weather","custom_gray_stationname":"wkyt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-03-06T15:19:11.117Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T11:13:14.749Z","description":{"basic":"A

My parents tell stories of me standing at a window watching thunderstorms and snowstorms for hours on end. This at the age of two! My fascination with weather continued to grow over the years. I remember going to my local library in Salyersville, where I grew up, and checking out every weather book they had. When I was a fifth grader, my quest to become a Television Meteorologist began. That's when I was selected as a weather watcher for my hometown. The person who selected me... none other than our late friend Brian Collins.\n\nMy work career has been all over the place. I started my meteorology career doing weekend weather at WKYT-TV in 1998. After a few years on weekends, I moved to the noon and 5:30 shows on weekdays. After 6 years of that, the WKYT morning show came calling and I stayed on it for a few years. I also became the first co-host of The Fox 56 Morning Edition.\n\nIt was at this point I took a leave of absence from WKYT to join WSAZ in Huntington, WV. I spent nearly 4 years there before returning to WKYT as Chief Meteorologist. I also took on double duty as the chief meteorologist for FOX 56. Told ya I have worked every shift possible!\n\nWhen I’m not doing weather, chances are you will find me cheering on my favorite sports teams. I’m a HUGE Kentucky Wildcats fan and bleed blue! I also love my Cincinnati Reds and Bengals.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wkyt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2020-09-02T03:06:24.717Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","twitter":"@kentuckyweather","personal_website":"https://kyweathercenter.com/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ChrisBaileyWKYT/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T21:31:30.793Z","description":{"basic":"A
