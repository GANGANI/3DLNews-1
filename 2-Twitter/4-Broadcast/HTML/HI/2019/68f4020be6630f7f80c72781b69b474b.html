Home.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I loved every city I've lived in. In Boise, I learned to play ice hockey and snowboard. In Kansas City, I began a long-term, but painful relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs. And in Dallas, I met my husband and our kids were born.\n\nI've covered amazing stories during my jaunts across the mainland: The Super Bowl in Dallas, The World Series, Tornados ripping through Kansas, and Hurricane Katrina. Our crew spent days in New Orleans -- no shower, we slept in the car, ate MREs, and had National Guard guns pointed at us, but we witnessed an amazing show of survival by the people of Louisiana.   \n\nEvery minute of every day during my career, I was having a blast. I was surrounded by great friends on the mainland, but after the kids were born, we realized how important it was to have family around.\n\nI grew up surrounded by family. When I was born, we lived in Waipahu, near the old 'Kawano Store' my great-grandparents owned. When I was four, we moved to Pearl City.  Almost every weekend, mom would make musubis before sunrise. She and my dad would take us to the beach. My brother, my sister, and I would play all day. Weekend evenings would be spent with cousins and the extended family. Life was good.\n\nI graduated from St. Andrew's Priory School and then, UH. While in college, I interned at KHNL and immediately after graduation, started working at KGMB. It's so funny to me that I have returned to both stations, only, they're ONE station now! This has been a homecoming for me in every way and after 17 years on the mainland, I can honestly say... there's no place like home!\n","org":"KHNL","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Chief Investigative Reporter","slug":"lynn-kawano","source":{"source_id":"24486343"},"status":true,"twitter":"LynnKawano","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-25T01:12:36.093Z","custom_gray_stationname":"khnl-kgmb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T02:42:22.165Z","description":{"basic":"\"It feels like home to be honest.

He brought me into his room where my mother was already awake, watching TV. Her eyes said it all. I looked to see what she was watching and my heart dropped.\n\nThat day was September 11, 2001.\n\nAll morning, I couldn't take my eyes off the television screen. I remember the reporters' eyes, their faces, voices, and actions. Amidst all the horror, I remember thinking to myself, ‘Why do we turn on the TV when disaster strikes?' I remember thinking what an honor it must be to have the public's trust.\n\nSeveral years later, I feel the same way.\n\nIt's an privilege to be back home reporting for the people who have shaped my life, my values, and my morals.\n\nI have a Broadcast Journalism degree from Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, California. There, I was also a reporter/anchor for the school's television news station, a writer for the campus newspaper, and the News Director for the campus radio station. That is where I became well versed in camera operations and editing software.\n\nDuring my college career, I've had the pleasure of interning at four news stations, KUSI, KNSD, KGTV in San Diego and Hawaii News Now while I went to summer school at UH. From fetching coffee for my producers to shadowing live reporters on breaking news, I've done everything an intern could ever dream of!\n\nMy first on-air job was in Lubbock, Texas. Born and raised on the beautiful island of Maui, moving to Texas was quite the culture shock. The West Texas winds are far different from the tropical trade winds.\n\nBut I traded in my rubber slippers for cowboy boots! From chasing tornados to live reporting in a blizzard, I loved every exhilarating second of it!\n\nI have a passion for news and love telling stories, especially stories that impact my community. I couldn't be happier to be home having your trust and sharing YOUR stories!\n\nIf you have a story idea, or just want to say hi, email me at chelseadavis@hawaiinewsnow or follow me on

Allyson's dad still jokes that if news doesn't work out, she can always get a job cleaning fish.\n\nAfter graduating from Virginia Commonwealth University with a degree in Electronic Media, Allyson worked her way up the ranks in news at stations in Virginia and North Carolina before accepting a job at the CBS affiliate in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe following year, Allyson was honored with an Emmy Award for producing breaking news coverage of the Tucson mass shooting, where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was wounded.  \n\nWhen she's not at work, you can find her fishing, hiking, tossing around a football at the beach or at Rainbow's Drive-In eating a mahi sandwich.\n","org":"KHNL","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Investigative

He was interested in the clouds from an extremely young age and has had one goal for most of his upbringing: become a weatherman. However, Drew has happily traded in the tornadoes for the trade winds.\n\nDrew was born in Austin, Texas, and has generational roots in the Lone Star state, but he truly goes where the weather takes him. He joined the Hawaii News Now team shortly after graduating from Texas A&M University with a degree in Meteorology. He started contributing remotely to the Hawaii News Now team in January of 2023 and moved to Honolulu in June. During that remote period, he practiced the Hawaiian language and learned as much as he could about the island. He landed his first on-air job at the age of 19 on KTEN in southeastern Oklahoma, eventually moving to KBTX in Bryan/College Station to work closer to school during his senior year.\n\nDrew was selected as the first Meteorology Fellow at KBTX, a program created by Gray Television to help foster and develop young meteorologists at Texas A&M University. He graduated with perfect grades in all of his Meteorology courses at Texas A&M and was awarded the “Outstanding Graduating Senior Award” from the university. When he was not storm chasing, studying, or forecasting, Drew led the young TV weather broadcasting program at Texas A&M. He helped launch the program in 2019, and helped refine it up until graduation.\n\nBesides weather, Drew enjoys college football, hiking, swimming, movie-going, and video-editing. He even has some experience on the stage as an improvisational comedian; although he’s retired now. Was (or is…) he funny? That’s still up for debate.\n\nHe’s blessed to have a loving mother, father, grandparents, and sister that still live in Dallas, Texas. Even though they are an eight-hour plane ride away, he’s excited to call Hawai’i home. He is humbled to have been granted this once in a lifetime opportunity and cannot wait to learn more about the island culture, continue to grow as a meteorologist, and to forecast for the best weather on the planet.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","custom_gray_stationname":"khnl","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-07-14T01:29:03.850Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T16:34:50.341Z","description":{"basic":"First

He brought me into his room where my mother was already awake, watching TV. Her eyes said it all. I looked to see what she was watching and my heart dropped.\n\nThat day was September 11, 2001.\n\nAll morning, I couldn't take my eyes off the television screen. I remember the reporters' eyes, their faces, voices, and actions. Amidst all the horror, I remember thinking to myself, ‘Why do we turn on the TV when disaster strikes?' I remember thinking what an honor it must be to have the public's trust.\n\nSeveral years later, I feel the same way.\n\nIt's an privilege to be back home reporting for the people who have shaped my life, my values, and my morals.\n\nI have a Broadcast Journalism degree from Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, California. There, I was also a reporter/anchor for the school's television news station, a writer for the campus newspaper, and the News Director for the campus radio station. That is where I became well versed in camera operations and editing software.\n\nDuring my college career, I've had the pleasure of interning at four news stations, KUSI, KNSD, KGTV in San Diego and Hawaii News Now while I went to summer school at UH. From fetching coffee for my producers to shadowing live reporters on breaking news, I've done everything an intern could ever dream of!\n\nMy first on-air job was in Lubbock, Texas. Born and raised on the beautiful island of Maui, moving to Texas was quite the culture shock. The West Texas winds are far different from the tropical trade winds.\n\nBut I traded in my rubber slippers for cowboy boots! From chasing tornados to live reporting in a blizzard, I loved every exhilarating second of it!\n\nI have a passion for news and love telling stories, especially stories that impact my community. I couldn't be happier to be home having your trust and sharing YOUR stories!\n\nIf you have a story idea, or just want to say hi, email me at chelseadavis@hawaiinewsnow or follow me on

All I remember was that, when my Dad dropped me off at school on his way to work, he would give me a dime to buy a newspaper at the nearby corner store. He didn't have time to read the paper at work, so I would bring it to school with me. And since I was (and still am) a voracious reader, I actually read the paper, and got interested in current events.\n\nI also had an interest in science -- in particular, space exploration and the race to get a man to the moon. When that finally happened, I watched Walter Cronkite and his excitement and knowledge as he covered the historic event.\n\nBoth journalism and science try to answer questions like What's happening? and Why? and How? Both journalism and science attract people who are curious and inquisitive. And since I can't really pick a favorite between the two, being able to report on the weather brings them together for me.\n\nI chose to go to St. Louis High School, primarily because it was one of the few schools at the time that had a class in television production and had a small working TV studio and equipment. Then it was on to Linfield College in Oregon, where I became news director of the student radio station during my freshman year. I also worked as the news director at a small market radio station near Portland, an experience that taught me a lot (that happens when your radio station is the only daily source of local news in that area). That's where I got to meet former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and dove into theater and music (that happens when it rains a lot).\n\nI returned to Hawaii after a dozen years away and worked in radio until an offer came to be a television weather anchor. I considered for three days whether to take the offer, until a good friend of mine said it would be an opportunity to spread science. So I accepted, and the opportunity also led to a chance to meet and sit in with some of the best local musicians, meet even more fascinating people, go to places most people don't see, experience some history, learn new things (like how to become a Chinese Lion dancer) -- and to share those stories with you, which I hope to continue here at Hawaii News Now.\n","org":"KHNL","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Weather Anchor/News

Being a parent and working at a children’s hospital, gives you a certain perspective on families in need and helping others.  \n\nFor the past three years, I’ve served as the director of communications and marketing for Shriners Hospitals for Children — Honolulu and it was more rewarding than I ever imagined. Giving keiki opportunities to appear in the hospital’s award-winning local TV ads; seeing physicians honored in the community; and landing patients’ appearances on Hawaii Five-0 were just some of the highlights. While working at Shriners Hospitals, I did some moonlighting by hosting Insights on PBS Hawaii where I moderated forums for the Governor’s and Congressional races.\n\nNow that I’ve returned to news, I’m coming back to my TV ‘ohana. KGMB hired me as an associate producer right out of college at the University of Pennsylvania and internships at CBS News in New York and Philadelphia. I was promoted to reporter and even worked with my now co-anchor, Keahi Tucker. We were both rookies and have come a long way since those early days.\n\nI moved on to report at KGW in Portland, Oregon and then returned home to anchor the morning news at KITV for eleven years. My most memorable stories include covering President Obama’s first inauguration; interviewing Donald Trump, the Hokulea’s arrival in Easter Island; getting up close to the lava at Kilauea; and hosting and producing the documentary, “War with Iraq, Through the Eyes of Hawaii’s Keiki,” which received an Edward R. Murrow Award.\n\nA Kamehameha Schools alum and 2016 cohort of Pacific Century Fellows, I currently serve on the boards of Friends of Shriners and Ka Honua Momona on Molokai. I’m humbled to be honored with Pacific Business News 2017 Women Who Mean Business Women to Watch.\n\nNature, dancing, volunteering and spending time with my husband and son, Sky, give me the give me the biggest joys and I’m thankful for the opportunity to inform, enlighten and inspire.  \n","org":"KHNL","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Evening News

He took on the responsibility of updating the campus with morning and afternoon announcements. There, he also began emceeing school assemblies and events, something that would carry through to high school and present day.\n\nAs a kid, Dillon was obsessed with watching local news – particularly his favorite station, KGMB9. It wasn’t until Kim Gennaula left the anchor desk that he realized he could make a career out of something that always intrigued him. \n\nHe recalls during her farewell, Gennaula was decked in lei with tears streaming down as a highlight reel recapped historic moments from her time in news. He says that moment inspired him to aim for a career the community could look back on, and see milestone moments and highlights. \n\nHe’s been full speed ahead in the world of news ever since, following the KGMB call letters to present-day Hawai‘i News Now.\n\nDillon left Kaua‘i for the “big city” of Honolulu in 2014 to study journalism at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. He graduated in 3.5 years with his Bachelor’s degree. During his senior year, he interned for college credit at Hawai‘i News Now. That internship was cut short when a position opened, and Dillon was hired.\n\nHe officially joined the HNN team Dec. 6, 2016 and has since worked in many different capacities. His most cherished roles were being a field reporter, the creator and host of the IGTV shortcast ‘What’s Happening Hawai‘i?,’ and current Digital Anchor for ‘This is Now.’\n\n“It is truly an honor to be able to tell the stories that matter most to the people of Hawaii. It is a responsibility we take seriously every day,” he said. “Along this journey, I carry the aloha of the people who have supported me along the way: My ‘ohana, friends, teachers and viewers. At the end of the day, I’m just a Kaua‘i boy grateful to be living the dream in the place he calls home.”","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"\"This is Now\" anchor and producer","slug":"","status":true,"type":"author","last_updated_date":"2023-03-07T21:22:00.881Z","custom_gray_stationname":"khnl-kgmb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"programming","twitter":"DillonAncheta "}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T02:51:37.379Z","description":{"basic":"As a teenager in the 1940s, Mr. Stanley Oshima knew the importance of ohana."},"headlines":{"basic":"He dropped out to put family and country first.
