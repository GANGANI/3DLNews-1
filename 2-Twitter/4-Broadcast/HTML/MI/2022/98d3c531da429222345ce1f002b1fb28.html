Blake has been reporting with WNEMTV5 since August 2019.\n\nBlake is familiar with what great things Mid-Michigan has to offer, as he is a Metro Detroit native. For his education, Blake went to The Windy City. He has a bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism from Loyola University Chicago. #GoRamblers! He believes his broadcast career truly blossomed when he was the morning intern for NBC 5 Chicago.\n\nDuring his time at Loyola, Blake helped lead the university’s only student-run sports program and won a Crystal Pillar award for his work with the institution’s student newscast “Loyola News Chicago.”\n\nThough accustomed to the cold Michigan weather, Blake braved the intense heat (up to 125-degrees) reporting and anchoring with KYMA in Yuma for two years. Blake has covered hot-topics like immigration surges at the border, the RedForEd teacher protests, and issues facing the agriculture industry. Blake has been fortunate to win a Regional Emmy award for his work with KYMA.\n\nBlake is a “morning bird,” and loves to watch Michigan’s beautiful sunrise with a hot cup of coffee, so he can’t wait to spend each morning with all of you. To know Blake, is to know he has the biggest sweet tooth, loves to laugh, and adores his pup, Fenty. Other interests of his include swimming, going to music festivals/concerts, journaling, and boating on Michigan’s beautiful lakes.\n\nIf you have a story idea, or would like to interact with Blake on social media, give him a follow!

After working in that position for just over 1.5 years, Mathieu is now WNEM's Weekday Wake-Up and News at Nine Meteorologist.  He's excited to move to mornings for the entire week and continue to bring you the forecast to get your day started!\n\nMathieu is from Canton, MI, a township located in western Metro Detroit. Growing up in the Motor City and a Ford Family has made Mathieu a huge car fanatic, but his love for weather always tops the list. Mathieu has been interested in weather for years, and can recall many hot summers, frigid winters, summer storms, and large snowfall events. Two weather events he’ll always remember are the Dexter, MI tornado in 2012 and the Polar Vortex cold air outbreak during the 2013-14 winter.\n\nMathieu graduated from Canton High School in 2017. He fell in love with broadcasting after his involvement at 88.1 FM The Park, the student-run radio station there. Combining that with his interest in weather took him to Central Michigan University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology. Mathieu was involved with News Central 34, the student-run newscast at CMU, every semester since his freshman year. He also interned at NBC 25 in Flint during his time in school. Mathieu graduated magna cum laude from Central Michigan University in May, 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in meteorology and two minors: mathematics and broadcast and cinematic arts.\n\nMathieu’s favorite types of weather are lake effect snow and severe convective thunderstorms. He has yet to see a tornado in-person, but it is on his bucket list! Overall, he loves broadcast meteorology because of the ability it has to potentially save lives in hazardous situations.\n\nSome hobbies Mathieu enjoys in his free time are working on and detailing cars, doing yard work, golfing, spending time at the family cabin up north, and listening to music.  Mathieu is a huge snowmobiling enthusiast too, in the winter you'll find him out on the trails as long as conditions allow!\n\nYou can connect with Mathieu Mondro on Facebook (Meteorologist Mathieu

During his time at WAND, Mark closely covered the University of Illinois, traveling to Tampa, Florida to cover the 2023 ReliaQuest Bowl and to both Pittsburgh, PA and Des Moines, IA for March Madness in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHe also enjoyed covering the Chicago Bears during training camp, traveling to Salem, VA for the Division III National Softball Tournament and of course, cruising around the area to cover high school sports! Mark was even on The Today Show to feature a local team during their Friday Morning Lights segment. Check it out here!\n\nDuring Mark's journey in North Dakota, he served as the play-by-play announcer for several state championships and covered Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis between the Patriots and the Eagles. He also followed the nationally ranked North Dakota hockey team, and traveled to Salt Lake City to cover March Madness.\n\nMark loves the atmosphere during a game and strives to capture the way sports connect a community. He hopes to share the moments that make people proud of their teams and hometowns.\n \nNo matter the experiences the job has given Mark, he'll still tell you April 21, 2018 is still the best day of his life—that’s when he got married to his wife, Kelly, who also works at WNEM. The two shared the anchor desk at their previous news stations in North Dakota and Illinois and have a calico cat named Stella.\n \nWhen Mark is not at work, he loves spending time with friends and family, shooting hoops, playing golf, playing cards with his grandpa, watching sports, hanging out at Lake Michigan, being his wife's Instagram husband, and spoiling his cat.\n \nMark went to Butler University, where he played club basketball and did play-by-play for various sporting events. While in college, he interned for ESPN 96.1, the Indiana Pacers, WOOD TV in Grand Rapids and WTHR in Indianapolis. Mark graduated in the spring of 2016 as the school's first Sports Media Major, and minored in business and mathematics.\n \nMark went to Rockford High School where during his senior year, he and the Rams met up with Saginaw High School in the 2012 Class A Boys Basketball State Championship. The Trojans won 54-42. Mark is excited to not only cover Saginaw High School but all the local schools in the area.\n\nIf you have a story idea for Mark or would like to just say hello, feel free to email him at Mark.Pearson@wnem.com, or find him on Twitter @MarkPearsonTV or follow his Facebook page Mark Pearson - WNEM

A Miami native and daughter of a Haitian immigrant, Rayvin is a graduate of Hofstra University with a master’s degree in journalism. She started her career in the news industry as a news assistant in New York City and transitioned into reporting at the beginning of 2020 covering New York’s Hudson Valley region.\n\nThroughout Rayvin’s time as a journalist she has contributed many stories to daily newscasts. Most notable is her viral story about Army veteran Everett Palmer, Jr., who died in a York County jail. When his family received his body back from the medical examiner’s office, his heart, brain, and throat bone were missing. \n\nShe also credits her journalistic prowess to her breaking news coverage of the Manhattan blackout of July 2019, where she covered the cancellation of the Jennifer Lopez concert at Madison Square Garden.\n\nWhen this zealous member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is not chasing down a source for a story, the proud dog mom can be found walking her Pomeranian, Na’Vi Fancee Bleu, talking with her family and friends back home, and roaming the town shopping and looking for good places to eat.\n\nRayvin is dedicated to telling the stories that impact the community. You can find her on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook or drop her a line at Rayvin.Bleu@wnem.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wnem","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7","last_updated_date":"2024-05-09T17:54:10.733Z"}}},{"_id":"KellyPearson","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Kelly Pearson","image":{"url":"","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"kelly.pearson@wnem.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"kelly.pearson@wnem.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"KellyPearson","firstName":"Kelly","lastName":"Pearson","byline":"Kelly Pearson","image":"","email":"kelly.pearson@wnem.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"","bio":"","longBio":"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wnem","last_updated_date":"2024-05-06T18:00:39.599Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T02:56:53.145Z","description":{"basic":"Jerry Carmien launched a flag football program decades ago.

After working in that position for just over 1.5 years, Mathieu is now WNEM's Weekday Wake-Up and News at Nine Meteorologist.  He's excited to move to mornings for the entire week and continue to bring you the forecast to get your day started!\n\nMathieu is from Canton, MI, a township located in western Metro Detroit. Growing up in the Motor City and a Ford Family has made Mathieu a huge car fanatic, but his love for weather always tops the list. Mathieu has been interested in weather for years, and can recall many hot summers, frigid winters, summer storms, and large snowfall events. Two weather events he’ll always remember are the Dexter, MI tornado in 2012 and the Polar Vortex cold air outbreak during the 2013-14 winter.\n\nMathieu graduated from Canton High School in 2017. He fell in love with broadcasting after his involvement at 88.1 FM The Park, the student-run radio station there. Combining that with his interest in weather took him to Central Michigan University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology. Mathieu was involved with News Central 34, the student-run newscast at CMU, every semester since his freshman year. He also interned at NBC 25 in Flint during his time in school. Mathieu graduated magna cum laude from Central Michigan University in May, 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in meteorology and two minors: mathematics and broadcast and cinematic arts.\n\nMathieu’s favorite types of weather are lake effect snow and severe convective thunderstorms. He has yet to see a tornado in-person, but it is on his bucket list! Overall, he loves broadcast meteorology because of the ability it has to potentially save lives in hazardous situations.\n\nSome hobbies Mathieu enjoys in his free time are working on and detailing cars, doing yard work, golfing, spending time at the family cabin up north, and listening to music.  Mathieu is a huge snowmobiling enthusiast too, in the winter you'll find him out on the trails as long as conditions allow!\n\nYou can connect with Mathieu Mondro on Facebook (Meteorologist Mathieu

Blake has been reporting with WNEMTV5 since August 2019.\n\nBlake is familiar with what great things Mid-Michigan has to offer, as he is a Metro Detroit native. For his education, Blake went to The Windy City. He has a bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism from Loyola University Chicago. #GoRamblers! He believes his broadcast career truly blossomed when he was the morning intern for NBC 5 Chicago.\n\nDuring his time at Loyola, Blake helped lead the university’s only student-run sports program and won a Crystal Pillar award for his work with the institution’s student newscast “Loyola News Chicago.”\n\nThough accustomed to the cold Michigan weather, Blake braved the intense heat (up to 125-degrees) reporting and anchoring with KYMA in Yuma for two years. Blake has covered hot-topics like immigration surges at the border, the RedForEd teacher protests, and issues facing the agriculture industry. Blake has been fortunate to win a Regional Emmy award for his work with KYMA.\n\nBlake is a “morning bird,” and loves to watch Michigan’s beautiful sunrise with a hot cup of coffee, so he can’t wait to spend each morning with all of you. To know Blake, is to know he has the biggest sweet tooth, loves to laugh, and adores his pup, Fenty. Other interests of his include swimming, going to music festivals/concerts, journaling, and boating on Michigan’s beautiful lakes.\n\nIf you have a story idea, or would like to interact with Blake on social media, give him a follow!
