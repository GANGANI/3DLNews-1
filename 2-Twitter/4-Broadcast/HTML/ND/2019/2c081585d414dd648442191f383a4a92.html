She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling. You might see her around!  \n\nHometown? \n\nPrinceton, MN and Leander, TX \n\nAlma Mater?\n\nBethany Lutheran College \n\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job? \n\nTalking to people and being able to tell their unique stories. \n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nAnything that helps people in the community, whether that be a political event, answer to a local crime, or small story showcasing one individual. \n\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA writer. \n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI went to college for film and developed a passion for stories that felt human - also, I just like talking to people!

I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.
