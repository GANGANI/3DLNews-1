His upbeat and vibrant personality will forever be remembered and cherished, and he will be deeply missed by our organization, Rip City and all who experienced him. Our love and condolences go to Bill’s wife, Lori and his sons, \u003cstrong>Adam\u003c/strong>, \u003cstrong>Nate\u003c/strong>, \u003cstrong>Luke\u003c/strong> and \u003cstrong>Chris\u003c/strong>.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Walton later played for the San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers from 1979 to 1985 and the Boston Celtics from 1985 to 1988, which included winning his second NBA championship in 1986.

A marathon six and a half hour, 19-inning game that ends with a walk off bases loaded single from Jose Bautista. This win, which probably should've kicked off a streak, actually started them down the path of falling out of contention, and is probably the last great moment of the season. Hey remember when extra inning games could go on forever? How many of the 46,000+ fans in attendance that day stuck around for all 19 innings? How many times did the Jays put a ton of Tigers runners on base in the extra 10 innings? Find out as we look back on Sportsfeld Storytime. \u003cbr />\u003cbr />Sick of hearing all the ads?
