Hatch Foundation announced Wednesday, May 2, 2018, a formal partnership with the University of Utah to erect a new facility to house Senator Hatch's archives from his 42 years in the Senate as well as offer forums to help train future leaders and discussions of policy. The new facility will be across the street from the Thomas S. Monson Center at 411 E. South Temple and will honor the legacy of Utah's long-serving senator who is retiring early next year.","copyright":"Leah Hogsten/The Salt Lake Tribune","created_date":"2018-05-02T17:59:13+00:00","credits":{"affiliation":[{"additional_properties":{},"name":"AP","type":"author"}],"by":[{"additional_properties":{},"name":"Leah Hogsten","type":"author"}]},"height":1809,"last_updated_date":"2018-05-02T17:59:13+00:00","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"sltrib","sponsored":false},"type":"image","url":"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XW5TC2XN6JCIRLCLVYNVAVHOTE.jpg","version":"0.6.0","width":2880}},"planning":{"scheduling":{"planned_publish_date":"2018-05-02T19:00:00.000Z","will_have_image":true}},"display_date":"2018-05-02T20:00:57.458Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"bwood","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Benjamin Wood","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/84944c25-9420-4622-8634-64690f03551b.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Benjamin joined The Tribune in the fall of 2014 as an education reporter.
