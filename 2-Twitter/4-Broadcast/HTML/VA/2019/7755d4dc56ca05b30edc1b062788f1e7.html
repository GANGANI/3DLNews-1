    /* HACK
    As mentioned above, we create a triangle that gets positioned 
    below the navlist following this recipe https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/
    Without any positioning, this creates a triangle with its rightmost item at the right
    side of the navlist item.
    From there, we shift the triangle 10px to the right so the middle of the
    triangle is at the right side of the navlist item
    At this point, we want to shift the triangle to the center (-50%) of the navlist item.
    However, we need to account for the weirdness of the padding. On the left, we have
    21px of true padding that doesn't get accounted for by the width of the element.
    On the right, we have 21px of fake "padding" in the form of a 1px sr-only class
    and this 20px triangle. As a result, we need to shift the triangle 10.5px (21px/2)
    to the left in addition to shifting the triangle -50%
