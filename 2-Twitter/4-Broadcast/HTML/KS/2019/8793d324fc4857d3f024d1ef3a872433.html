It was at IUP that I majored in Communications Media and joined one of my school’s news production clubs where I finally began to see that my dream was achievable. I got experience behind the cameras, field reporting and floor directing. I even joined my school’s radio station, and hosted my own show called “The Median Mix”, and to my surprise people all over the world tuned in.\n\n\nI took advantage of my university's study abroad program and traveled to South Korea to visit my father’s side of the family, learn and develop more world news knowledge. \n\nIt all led me to Topeka! I’ve been a Morning Producer here at WIBW, and now I report three days a week and anchor the weekend evening shows.\n\nWhat a pleasure it is to tell the many stories of Topeka!

I grew up in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a city about 40 miles south of Green Bay on the Lake Michigan shore. That means I became a Packers' fan by birth!\n\nI earned a degree in broadcast communication from Marquette University in Milwaukee. My first job in the business was for a radio station in my hometown doing fishing reports. For three summers, I got up at 4 a.m. to talk about how the fish were biting in Lake Michigan. Just before graduation, I landed a job at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, where I spent nearly two years learning the ropes of a newscast off-air as a producer.\n\nA chance to be in front of the camera as a reporter brought me to Topeka and WIBW-TV in May 1996. I've covered crime, the legislature and a host of other topics, and am also responsible for the weekly To Your Health feature. I'm proud to say my reporting work has earned numerous awards from the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, Kansas Associated Press, American Cancer Society and RTNDA, and our news team has twice earned smaller market Best Newscast honors from the Heartland Regional Emmys.\n\nIt's my honor to be involved with several area organizations and events, including the Children's Tumor Foundation, American Cancer Society, Easter Seals Capper Foundation, American Heart Association and the Race Against Breast Cancer. For many years, Ralph Hipp and I emceed local segments of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethon.\n\nI married WIBW-TV Chief Photographer Doug Brown in June of 2000. We live in Topeka with our many dogs and cats. In our spare time, we enjoy working outdoors, scrapbooking, running and searching for great

I grew up in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a city about 40 miles south of Green Bay on the Lake Michigan shore. That means I became a Packers' fan by birth!\n\nI earned a degree in broadcast communication from Marquette University in Milwaukee. My first job in the business was for a radio station in my hometown doing fishing reports. For three summers, I got up at 4 a.m. to talk about how the fish were biting in Lake Michigan. Just before graduation, I landed a job at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, where I spent nearly two years learning the ropes of a newscast off-air as a producer.\n\nA chance to be in front of the camera as a reporter brought me to Topeka and WIBW-TV in May 1996. I've covered crime, the legislature and a host of other topics, and am also responsible for the weekly To Your Health feature. I'm proud to say my reporting work has earned numerous awards from the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, Kansas Associated Press, American Cancer Society and RTNDA, and our news team has twice earned smaller market Best Newscast honors from the Heartland Regional Emmys.\n\nIt's my honor to be involved with several area organizations and events, including the Children's Tumor Foundation, American Cancer Society, Easter Seals Capper Foundation, American Heart Association and the Race Against Breast Cancer. For many years, Ralph Hipp and I emceed local segments of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethon.\n\nI married WIBW-TV Chief Photographer Doug Brown in June of 2000. We live in Topeka with our many dogs and cats. In our spare time, we enjoy working outdoors, scrapbooking, running and searching for great antiques!","slug":"","instagram":"wibwmelissa","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wibw","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-08-15T20:18:03.887Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:24:53.521Z","description":{"basic":"The

I grew up in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a city about 40 miles south of Green Bay on the Lake Michigan shore. That means I became a Packers' fan by birth!\n\nI earned a degree in broadcast communication from Marquette University in Milwaukee. My first job in the business was for a radio station in my hometown doing fishing reports. For three summers, I got up at 4 a.m. to talk about how the fish were biting in Lake Michigan. Just before graduation, I landed a job at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, where I spent nearly two years learning the ropes of a newscast off-air as a producer.\n\nA chance to be in front of the camera as a reporter brought me to Topeka and WIBW-TV in May 1996. I've covered crime, the legislature and a host of other topics, and am also responsible for the weekly To Your Health feature. I'm proud to say my reporting work has earned numerous awards from the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, Kansas Associated Press, American Cancer Society and RTNDA, and our news team has twice earned smaller market Best Newscast honors from the Heartland Regional Emmys.\n\nIt's my honor to be involved with several area organizations and events, including the Children's Tumor Foundation, American Cancer Society, Easter Seals Capper Foundation, American Heart Association and the Race Against Breast Cancer. For many years, Ralph Hipp and I emceed local segments of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethon.\n\nI married WIBW-TV Chief Photographer Doug Brown in June of 2000.

That means I became a Packers' fan by birth!\n\nI earned a degree in broadcast communication from Marquette University in Milwaukee. My first job in the business was for a radio station in my hometown doing fishing reports. For three summers, I got up at 4 a.m. to talk about how the fish were biting in Lake Michigan. Just before graduation, I landed a job at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, where I spent nearly two years learning the ropes of a newscast off-air as a producer.\n\nA chance to be in front of the camera as a reporter brought me to Topeka and WIBW-TV in May 1996. I've covered crime, the legislature and a host of other topics, and am also responsible for the weekly To Your Health feature. I'm proud to say my reporting work has earned numerous awards from the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, Kansas Associated Press, American Cancer Society and RTNDA, and our news team has twice earned smaller market Best Newscast honors from the Heartland Regional Emmys.\n\nIt's my honor to be involved with several area organizations and events, including the Children's Tumor Foundation, American Cancer Society, Easter Seals Capper Foundation, American Heart Association and the Race Against Breast Cancer. For many years, Ralph Hipp and I emceed local segments of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethon.\n\nI married WIBW-TV Chief Photographer Doug Brown in June of 2000. We live in Topeka with our many dogs and cats. In our spare time, we enjoy working outdoors, scrapbooking, running and searching for great antiques!","slug":"","instagram":"wibwmelissa","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wibw","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-08-15T20:18:03.887Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:59:54.390Z","description":{"basic":"The Topeka Rowing Assoc. will offer an Intro to Row class from 8 to 10 a.m. Saturday, June 1 at Lake Shawnee -

I was born in Morocco believe it or not. That's on the northwest part of Africa. My father was in the Navy at the time. From there, we moved to Poplar Bluff, MO where I became fascinated with thunderstorms as a child. That fascination has not faded.\n\nI am a graduate of the University of Missouri Columbia with a Bachelor of Science in Soils & Atmospheric Science. I am certified by the American Meteorological Society and was the 98th meteorologist in the world to obtain the title of \"Certified Broadcast Meteorologist\".\n\nMy first job in television was with KRCG-TV in Jefferson City, MO. I will never forget the 30-mile drive to work at 3AM for the morning shift. I was terribly nervous my first few times on air. The studio was so quiet and my heart was so loud. I can never thank my former boss Mike Roberts enough for his patience and guidance in my first years on air.\n\nI joined WIBW-TV in February of 2001 and have had amazing experiences here. We see everything in Kansas from blizzards to tornadoes. In my time with WIBW-TV, I have reported temperatures ranging from -20 to 110 degrees. Northeast Kansas has such distinct and extreme weather swings. It keeps you on your toes as a meteorologist.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of this job is talking to school kids. The curiosity about weather always reminds me of the feeling that I had at their age. I always wonder which ones of them will become a meteorologist.\n\nI love to try new things and see new places. Of course, my favorite hobby is storm chasing. When severe weather is in our area. I will be in the office and on your television. On the occasion that severe weather is in progress in other parts of the Midwest and will not affect northeast Kansas. You might see me driving toward some of the nastiest clouds in the world.","slug":"","instagram":"wibwjeremy","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"expertise":"Weather","custom_gray_stationname":"wibw","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2022-08-30T17:27:39.292Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T23:45:17.917Z","description":{"basic":"A rainy end to the week"},"headlines":{"basic":"Scattered Rain Continues Tonight","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/P6418SZKv9rEYHnKHGBOYCL2eNQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","galleries":[],"keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"t_e68131df7efe4a89b615a490e1ddcf36_name_file_1280x720_2000_v3_1_.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/P6418SZKv9rEYHnKHGBOYCL2eNQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/P6418SZKv9rEYHnKHGBOYCL2eNQ=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/l7AGaI4rgilf7OvrpPT_yyOFxPY=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","version":0},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"a781235e78fe5a76a9c10d5fb71baf4f63f0c4832421113821e678372e58d05b"},"caption":"Scattered rain continues tonight","created_date":"2024-05-30T23:44:19Z","height":720,"last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T23:44:19Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray"},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Scattered rain continues tonight","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/I2AITMCK7JAADJJLZRJVJCLR2E.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"imageId":null,"ingestImageToAnglerfish":true,"photographer":null,"usage_instructions":null},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wibw":{"website_section":{"path":"/news","_website":"wibw","name":"News","_id":"/news","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/30/scattered-rain-tonight-early-friday/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wibw","websites":{"wibw":{"website_section":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wibw","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wibw","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1041},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wibw./weather/forecast"},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/thursday-forecast-rain-increases-through-day/"}},"_id":"N3M5KGJJEJBD5E5QGYW7O6BKMA","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wibw","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wibw","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1041},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wibw./weather/forecast"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/thursday-forecast-rain-increases-through-day/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/30/watch-13-sports-coaches-show-ep-6/","content_elements":[{"_id":"7ZT33TMAU5B6VJV3HDJ2EPU2OE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"HYV3GNCQ7FCWPNOYY4WZ32U22Q","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"TOPEKA, Kan.

I grew up in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a city about 40 miles south of Green Bay on the Lake Michigan shore. That means I became a Packers' fan by birth!\n\nI earned a degree in broadcast communication from Marquette University in Milwaukee. My first job in the business was for a radio station in my hometown doing fishing reports. For three summers, I got up at 4 a.m. to talk about how the fish were biting in Lake Michigan. Just before graduation, I landed a job at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, where I spent nearly two years learning the ropes of a newscast off-air as a producer.\n\nA chance to be in front of the camera as a reporter brought me to Topeka and WIBW-TV in May 1996. I've covered crime, the legislature and a host of other topics, and am also responsible for the weekly To Your Health feature. I'm proud to say my reporting work has earned numerous awards from the Kansas Association of Broadcasters, Kansas Associated Press, American Cancer Society and RTNDA, and our news team has twice earned smaller market Best Newscast honors from the Heartland Regional Emmys.\n\nIt's my honor to be involved with several area organizations and events, including the Children's Tumor Foundation, American Cancer Society, Easter Seals Capper Foundation, American Heart Association and the Race Against Breast Cancer. For many years, Ralph Hipp and I emceed local segments of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethon.\n\nI married WIBW-TV Chief Photographer Doug Brown in June of 2000. We live in Topeka with our many dogs and cats. In our spare time, we enjoy working outdoors, scrapbooking, running and searching for great antiques!","slug":"","instagram":"wibwmelissa","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wibw","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-08-15T20:18:03.887Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T20:54:14.010Z","description":{"basic":"A

She’d use that framework to create a year-long weekly feature series at WIBW highlighting the pioneers who came before her, titled “IX at 50: The Trailblazers of Women’s Sports in Kansas.” \n\nOutside of KCTV5, you can listen to Marleah’s Chiefs coverage on 101 The FOX, 94.9 KCMO and 95.7 The Vibe. She’s a host for KC Sports Network and leads their storytelling channel. \n\nIn her free time, Marleah enjoys yoga, reading, and spending time with her family, friends and cat, Dolly.
