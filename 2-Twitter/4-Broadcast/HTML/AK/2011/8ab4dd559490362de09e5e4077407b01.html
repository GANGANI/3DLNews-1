In 2008, while finishing her Bachelor of Arts in journalism and public communications at University of Alaska Anchorage, she was employed as an operator for a local CBS affiliate and ran graphics for the Alaska Aces for five years. \nAfter a decade-long commitment to directing newscasts from the control room of Alaska's News Source, she decided to come out from behind the camera to help tell Alaska's story. In her time at Alaska's News Source Carly has directed numerous award-winning newscasts and specials, as well as running audio, cameras, and graphics — going so far as obtaining her class B CDL and operating the station satellite truck. \nBorn and raised in Anchorage, she was honored to grow up with a family cabin her father built on the Kenai River where she was taught patience with a fishing pole and learned the power of a story told around a kitchen table. \nCarly is primarily a valley-based journalist after moving to Palmer in the summer of 2021 and aims to cover the greater Matanuska-Susitna area.

Aaron realized that firsthand while growing up in the Deep South. From ice storms, to snow, tornadoes and even hurricanes, it was the combination of wanting to understand these events that set the path for him to become a meteorologist. \n\nAaron attended Mississippi State University where he obtained his degree in meteorology with a minor in communication. While studying to become a meteorologist, Aaron also attended culinary school at Mississippi University for Women, another passion of his. \n\nAaron's career has taken him from Mississippi, to Missouri and now to the Last Frontier where he hopes to spend the rest of his time. While he does miss the unique weather and severe storms in the Deep South, the weather in Alaska is quickly taking hold as some of his favorite to forecast. \n\nWhen not forecasting the weather, Aaron loves to explore everything Alaska has to offer. From hiking, to the food and scenic views, there's nothing that he hasn't been disappointed in. When not out in nature you Aaron enjoys binge watching Netflix and writing poetry. If you have any weather related questions or stories, feel free to reach out. Aaron loves to talk weather anytime, even when grocery shopping. \n\nYou can also follow him on Facebook and Twitter. \n\n(Photo Credit: Freeze Frame Photography)\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4","last_updated_date":"2021-02-20T00:38:16.265Z"}}},{"_id":"beth-verge","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Beth Verge","org":"Anchorage, Alaska","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/53ba98ca-e89a-40d6-a507-ba610f903026.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Beth Verge is the Late Edition anchor and producer for KTUU and KYES in Anchorage.","url":"","slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":""},{"site":"facebook","url":"facebook.com/bethreports"},{"site":"twitter","url":"ktuubeth"},{"site":"instagram","url":"bethreports"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"facebook","url":"facebook.com/bethreports","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"twitter","url":"ktuubeth","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"instagram","url":"bethreports","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"beth-verge","firstName":"Beth","lastName":"Verge","byline":"Beth Verge","role":"Anchor/Exec.

In 2008, while finishing her Bachelor of Arts in journalism and public communications at University of Alaska Anchorage, she was employed as an operator for a local CBS affiliate and ran graphics for the Alaska Aces for five years. \nAfter a decade-long commitment to directing newscasts from the control room of Alaska's News Source, she decided to come out from behind the camera to help tell Alaska's story. In her time at Alaska's News Source Carly has directed numerous award-winning newscasts and specials, as well as running audio, cameras, and graphics — going so far as obtaining her class B CDL and operating the station satellite truck. \nBorn and raised in Anchorage, she was honored to grow up with a family cabin her father built on the Kenai River where she was taught patience with a fishing pole and learned the power of a story told around a kitchen table. \nCarly is primarily a valley-based journalist after moving to Palmer in the summer of 2021 and aims to cover the greater Matanuska-Susitna area.

Like so many others, she never left. Lauren began her career in broadcasting as a radio journalist in Anchorage and turned her focus to television starting in 1986. She said she didn’t expect to land in Alaska permanently or get a job in journalism (her degree is in anthropology) but both have been wonderful rewards. \n\nLauren has been recognized many times by both The Alaska Press Club and The Alaska Broadcasters Association for excellence in journalism. She recently shared a James Beard Award for Best Television Series about food sustainability in Alaska.\n\n“I love Alaska. It’s where I’ve raised my family, where I feel most at home and connected,” she said. “I consider it a privilege to be able to share stories about people who live in our community and the issues that matter to us all.”\n\nShe added that most of all, she feels lucky. \n\n“How many people can say they’ve had a job they love for more than 30 years? “And now I get to do it every day at KTUU 2 and KYES 5.

that?”","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7","last_updated_date":"2024-05-24T20:22:07.485Z","role":"Senior

Aaron realized that firsthand while growing up in the Deep South. From ice storms, to snow, tornadoes and even hurricanes, it was the combination of wanting to understand these events that set the path for him to become a meteorologist. \n\nAaron attended Mississippi State University where he obtained his degree in meteorology with a minor in communication. While studying to become a meteorologist, Aaron also attended culinary school at Mississippi University for Women, another passion of his. \n\nAaron's career has taken him from Mississippi, to Missouri and now to the Last Frontier where he hopes to spend the rest of his time. While he does miss the unique weather and severe storms in the Deep South, the weather in Alaska is quickly taking hold as some of his favorite to forecast. \n\nWhen not forecasting the weather, Aaron loves to explore everything Alaska has to offer. From hiking, to the food and scenic views, there's nothing that he hasn't been disappointed in. When not out in nature you Aaron enjoys binge watching Netflix and writing poetry. If you have any weather related questions or stories, feel free to reach out. Aaron loves to talk weather anytime, even when grocery shopping. \n\nYou can also follow him on Facebook and Twitter. \n\n(Photo Credit: Freeze Frame

Wow!\" Jackie says.\n\nAlthough she's lived in Alaska for much of her life, Jackie had the opportunity to travel all over the world, thanks to a mother who believed travel was one the best educations one could have -- plus the fact that she has relatives in Europe and Indonesia -- and her father worked in the Middle East for a time.\n\nDoing the weather at Channel 2 News keeps Jackie on her toes since Alaska presents some of the most challenging weather situations in the world. \"It's definitely not the same old thing every day.\"\n\nJackie married Dannie Pearson, a former Channel 2 photographer, and counts as part of her family two cats ... and would have more if it were up to her.\n\n(Photo Credit: Freeze Frame Photography)","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"middleName":"K.","expertise":"Alaska weather, arctic conditions, climate change","last_updated_date":"2021-03-15T23:30:43.587Z","custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T02:44:58.779Z","description":{"basic":"Several low pressure systems will pass south of mainland Alaska through the rest of the week.

Like so many others, she never left. Lauren began her career in broadcasting as a radio journalist in Anchorage and turned her focus to television starting in 1986. She said she didn’t expect to land in Alaska permanently or get a job in journalism (her degree is in anthropology) but both have been wonderful rewards. \n\nLauren has been recognized many times by both The Alaska Press Club and The Alaska Broadcasters Association for excellence in journalism. She recently shared a James Beard Award for Best Television Series about food sustainability in Alaska.\n\n“I love Alaska. It’s where I’ve raised my family, where I feel most at home and connected,” she said. “I consider it a privilege to be able to share stories about people who live in our community and the issues that matter to us all.”\n\nShe added that most of all, she feels lucky. \n\n“How many people can say they’ve had a job they love for more than 30 years? “And now I get to do it every day at KTUU 2 and KYES 5. What could be better than that?”","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7","last_updated_date":"2024-05-24T20:22:07.485Z","role":"Senior Reporter"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T01:46:12.135Z","description":{"basic":"Anchorage Election Officials urge the more than 800 voters with ballot issues to cure their mayoral runoff ballots by the 4 p.m. deadline on Wednesday."},"headlines":{"basic":"Deadline to cure ballots in runoff election on Wednesday","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/IrMHPH5MbRjEezteuxAI503w-_4=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM.bmp","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"application/octet-stream","originalName":"Still0402_00011.bmp","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM.bmp","owner":"scole@ktuu.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/IrMHPH5MbRjEezteuxAI503w-_4=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM.bmp","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/IrMHPH5MbRjEezteuxAI503w-_4=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM.bmp","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/DsliBUWynaEMoRLO9QflXa1leH4=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/G7SGXRW23ZATXKZYIIVLBLGXGM.bmp","usage_instructions":"unrestricted","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"22c7dc65ef7baaa02235462bbc5fc10cd38480d54975e8ea003d98597eacb9d2"},"caption":"Anchorage Election Officials say more than 800 ballots still need to be cured from the Anchorage Mayoral Runoff Election.","created_date":"2024-04-02T23:54:07Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"KTUU","type":"author"}],"by":[{"_id":"Jeremy Kashatok","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Jeremy Kashatok ","org":"Anchorage, AK","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/d10b0777-103b-4451-9e54-660508a479bb.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Jeremy was born on Kodiak, and raised in Kipnuk, Alaska.

But when I saw the opportunity to not only work in sports, but to give back to something that has meant so much to me, I had to take the opportunity … and it’s the greatest decision I ever made.”\n\nWhen he’s not in the studio or out in the field, Tyler spends his free time producing sports edits across his social media pages, exploring the nature of America’s Last Frontier, or catching up on the latest release in the video game world. \n\nIf you’ve got a story that needs to be told, feel free to reach out to Tyler at tlane@ktuu.com\n","slug":"tyler-lane","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"sports","last_updated_date":"2023-11-02T06:13:47.803Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2","twitter":"@Tylerlanektuu","linkedin":"tylerlanektuu","role":"Sports Reporter"}}}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":1080,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-27T01:50:39Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"South Anchorage wins 2024 DI Soccer State Championship","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/WOEUH2B4BVFXVKORN6V64HRWVI.bmp","version":"0.10.9","width":1920,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"KTUU"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"ktuu":{"website_section":{"path":"/sports","_website":"ktuu","name":"Sports","_id":"/sports","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/26/south-takes-down-colony-state-title-rematch/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"ktuu","websites":{"ktuu":{"website_section":{"_id":"/sports","_website":"ktuu","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Sports","description":"Alaska's Sports Source covers sports news from around the state of Alaska.","path":"/sports","parent_id":"/","parent":{"default":"/"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/sports","site":{"site_title":"Sports","burst_widget":{},"site_tagline":"Sports","site_keywords":"Alaska sports, Anchorage sports, Iron Dog, Iditarod, Athlete of the Week, Mount Marathon, Fishing Report, salmon fishing","site_description":"Alaska's Sports Source covers sports news from around the state of Alaska.","site_about":"Alaska's Sports Source"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Sports"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/sports"},"_website":"ktuu","name":"Sports","order":{"default":1017,"publishing-sections":1087,"navigation-menu-links":1005,"footer-content-links":1003},"parent":{"default":"/","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/","footer-content-links":"/"},"ancestors":{"default":["/"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/"],"footer-content-links":["/"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"ktuu./sports"},"website_url":"/2024/05/27/south-anchorage-takes-home-2024-soccer-state-title-24-hours-after-seeing-multiple-individuals-suspended/"}},"_id":"H2IGFH24MJCUHHCDIQ55A6H5K4","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/sports","_website":"ktuu","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Sports","description":"Alaska's Sports Source covers sports news from around the state of Alaska.","path":"/sports","parent_id":"/","parent":{"default":"/"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/sports","site":{"site_title":"Sports","burst_widget":{},"site_tagline":"Sports","site_keywords":"Alaska sports, Anchorage sports, Iron Dog, Iditarod, Athlete of the Week, Mount Marathon, Fishing Report, salmon fishing","site_description":"Alaska's Sports Source covers sports news from around the state of Alaska.","site_about":"Alaska's Sports Source"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Sports"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/sports"},"_website":"ktuu","name":"Sports","order":{"default":1017,"publishing-sections":1087,"navigation-menu-links":1005,"footer-content-links":1003},"parent":{"default":"/","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/","footer-content-links":"/"},"ancestors":{"default":["/"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/"],"footer-content-links":["/"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"ktuu./sports"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/27/south-anchorage-takes-home-2024-soccer-state-title-24-hours-after-seeing-multiple-individuals-suspended/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/28/maynard-mountain-men-recognized-memorial-day-ceremony-whittier/","content_elements":[{"_id":"IRJKO6A42RGPLEQHOCBUEAMXEI","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"FMJCB7H6OJFXVMC26QDZOZWLZU","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"WHITTIER, Alaska (KTUU) -

He's lived in nine states and is the youngest of seven kids. He takes pleasure in knowing that his hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, is much colder than Anchorage in the winter. Joe has road trips in his blood, as he likes to say, \"on three sides of his family.\" Now in Alaska, there are only five states he hasn't at least driven through. Joe talks a lot. He's very social and loves people in general. His non travel, non news passions include: playing guitar and singing, writing literature, watching horror movies, checking out \"haunted\" places and cooking. He considers himself an \"amateur chef.\" His favorite news experience was tornado spotting for a legendary country music radio station in Wichita, Kansas. Joe has 27 nieces and nephews. He became a great uncle before turning 30. He has recently published his first horror story and is very proud of that.
