        <strong>Glenn Highway Northbound Eagle River Bridge:</strong> Two lanes opened to traffic. Far left lane remains closed. Speed reductions.<br>
        <strong>Glenn Highway Mirror Lake (MP 23-25):</strong> Due to difficulties with filling the sink holes and the continued shifting of the  ground, there are several humps in the road surface that will make the roadway  unsafe. Crews are actively working on these issues. One lane detours on southbound and northbound highway continue. Please continue to plan for substantial delays and additional commuting time.<br>
        <strong>Glenn Highway/Old Glenn MP 29.3:</strong> SB reduced to one lane. NB all lanes OPEN. Paving and striping complete. Crews are working on safety issues. Speed reduction in area.<br>
        <strong>Glenn Highway Northbound Palmer Flyover:</strong> Approach is open to one lane. Temporary repairs complete.<br>
        <strong>Seward Highway between Tudor &amp; 36th: </strong>SB lanes OPEN, NB lane  one lane closed. Speed reduction in area.<br>
        <strong>Seward Highway MP 114 to 104: </strong>The department advises against travel in  this area. Rock fall is an ongoing issue due to continued aftershocks. Please do not stop in the area. Please do not gather water at MP 109; rock fall at MP 109 is particularly active. In the interest of safety we are temporarily  closing the water site. <br>
        <strong>Minnesota Drive Northbound and Southbound Ramps to International:</strong> OPEN all lanes</p>
      <h5><strong>Facilities Inspections: </strong></h5>
      <p>The Division of Facilities Services continues to conduct safety assessments at state and public owned facilities in the affected area. Approximately 128 facilities have been identified for assessment, at this time approximately 51 assessments are complete. Assessments on critical state facilities have been completed or are scheduled for completion in the next 2 days.</p>
      <p>The division is using a combination of state trained engineers and contracted consultant architects and engineers, and anticipates additional support from agencies and organizations outside of the state.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: No one should enter buildings that have not been assessed. Buildings that have been assessed are clearly marked with a placard indicating the results of the inspection. </strong></p>
      <h5><strong>Measurement Standards Commercial Vehicle Enforcement (MSCVE):</strong></h5>
      <p>MSCVE offices are still closed due to earthquake damage in  their building. Staff is working from remote locations and permits can still be issued. To request permits, or for any MSCVE relation inquiries, please email <a href="mailto:MSCVE@alaska.gov">MSCVE@alaska.gov</a>.</p>
      <h5><strong>Bridge Inspections:</strong></h5>
      <p>All available DOT&amp;PF bridge inspectors are in Southcentral Alaska and are conducting technical bridge inspections on 243 bridges in the earthquake-affected area.

        Due to ongoing earthquake recovery efforts, public safety and transportation officials are requesting that Alaskans avoid the area of Vine Road that suffered significant damage during Friday&rsquo;s Earthquake. Engineers and public safety officials are assessing the damage to the area, and unstable ground may put the public at risk. While it&rsquo;s tempting to take selfies and explore, doing so is unsafe and inhibits the ability of officials to address the situation. Construction work has begun, and heavy equipment is being brought into the area to facilitate repairs.</p>

      <p><strong>Asphalt in the Winter</strong><br>
        We don&rsquo;t usually pave in the winter. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s harder to compact asphalt before it cools and hardens when it&rsquo;s cold outside. Asphalt that is sufficiently compacted is stronger and lasts longer. Paving in the winter isn&rsquo;t ideal, but it&rsquo;s also not impossible. Here are some steps that we&rsquo;re going to take that will allow us to repair asphalt damaged by the 2018 earthquake. </p>
<p>There are two main factors that affect asphalt compaction are temperature and time. </p>
      <p>First, temperature:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We can add chemicals to the asphalt that will allow it to be compacted at lower temperatures than usual, which will give us more time to compact.</li>
        <li>We will get the asphalt mix as hot as we can before we pave.</li>
        <li>We will place a thicker layer of asphalt, because a thicker layer will take longer to cool.</li>
        <li>We will tarp the truckloads of asphalt to help keep it hot during transport. </li>
      </ul>
<p>Second, time:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We will use our largest available rollers to cover the most ground as fast as possible.</li>
        <li>We will run multiple rollers at the same time to increase the amount of compaction in a given time period.</li>
        <li>We will minimize haul times by using the closest available asphalt plant as much as possible.</li>
        <li>We will minimize truck wait times.</li>
        <li>We will pave continuously to avoid stop times.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We don&rsquo;t usually pave in the winter because it harder and uses more resources, but when it needs to be done, we know how to do it right. Alaska&rsquo;s contractors are experienced and they are dedicated to repairing the asphalt surfaces damaged by this quake.</p>
      <p><strong>Bridges: they were designed for this.<br>
      </strong><em>How DOT&amp;PF prepared its bridges for an earthquake and what to expect now</em> </p>
<p>Here at DOT&amp;PF, our bridge engineers have understood the threat of an earthquake and have engineered and retrofitted bridges across the state to withstand an event like what we experienced on Friday, November 30. Here are some important facts about state-maintained bridges and what you can expect from our staff as southcentral Alaska continues to recover from the latest quake.</p>
      <p>What we&rsquo;ve been doing:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Alaska&rsquo;s bridges are designed in specific ways to stay standing during an earthquake. Many older bridges in the state have also been retrofitted to improve their performance in a potential earthquake.</li>
        <li>The main goal when building new bridges or retrofitting old ones is to prevent collapse, which helps ensure your safety when traveling.</li>
        <li>Every single one of our bridges is inspected by bridge engineers at least every two years. They identify problems, if there are any, and repairs are prioritized and scheduled.</li>
        <li>In extreme cases, bridge inspectors can close a bridge to ensure your safety. Thankfully, these extreme situations are rare.</li>
        <li>Every time a new bridge is constructed or an old one is worked on, the bridge is inspected by highly trained engineers, including experts in seismic design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What we&rsquo;re doing now and what&rsquo;s to come:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>After this earthquake, we will need to make repairs to some bridges to ensure they are safe for the traveling public. Some of those repairs may need to happen immediately and some may happen over the course of several years.</li>
        <li>Every single bridge affected by this quake will be inspected by bridge engineers and a plan will be developed to address any repairs needed. After an initial assessment of all bridges, engineers will return for more thorough inspections of each bridge.</li>
        <li>If a bridge is determined to be unsafe to travel over (or under), we will close the area to travel. If the bridge is determined to be structurally sound, it will remain open.</li>
        <li>It is possible that our engineers will determine some bridges will require weight restrictions until permanent repairs can be made.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3:30 p.m.</h4>
      <p><strong>Southcentral Alaska: </strong>we've got rain and snow on the way. *TRAVEL IS DIFFICULT* Please stay off the roads at least through Monday if possible. Bad weather, damage from the earthquake, and ongoing repairs will make travel difficult, slow, and frustrating. Work from home if you can.</p>
      <p>We are working at eight of the highest priority sites out of the 50 damaged locations on state-maintained infrastructure identified so far. The weather rolling in will slow down our response, but we¬†will continue to work on repairs alongside our dedicated contractors.</p>
        <p>Detours at two major sites on the Glenn Highway at Eagle River and Mirror Lake are shown on maps: <a href="/earthquake2018/img/map1.jpg" target="_blank">Eagle River Loop Road Bridge Closure</a> and <a href="/earthquake2018/img/map2.jpg" target="_blank">Mirror Lake Detour</a>. These detours will cause significant delays as we make major repairs. If you drive into Anchorage tomorrow morning (and we hope you don't), prepare yourself for major congestion and a long commute.</p>
        <p>Many thanks to all of you for your patience, to all the contractors and their dedicated staff who have provided essential services, and to all the DOT&amp;PF employees who have been working non-stop on this response.</p>
      <h4>12:00 p.m.</h4>
      <p><strong>Glenn Highway Update</strong><br>
        The Palmer exit at the Glenn/Parks interchange is now OPEN to one lane of traffic. We still advise you to avoid the area if possible and only travel if it is absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p>Glenn Highway southbound traffic, just south of the Knik River at the Old Glenn Highway, is down to one lane. Again, please avoid traveling unless absolutely necessary.</p>
      <h4>10:30 a.m.</h4>
      <p><strong>General Information</strong><br>
        DOT&amp;PF has documented approximately 50 potential damage sites. Earthquake aftershocks are continuing to contribute to settling and cracking. </p>
      <p>DOT&amp;PF maintenance and construction crews are actively working the eight major damage sites, located on the Glenn Highway, Seward Highway, andMinnesota Drive. DOT&amp;PF is working with private sector partners on restarting hot asphalt plants in order to pave high priority highway breaks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kenai Spur Highway: Maintenance crews will complete the Kenai Spur Highway repairs today. Permanent repairs will take place in the spring when asphalt plants are operational again.</li>
        <li>Glenn Highway: Northbound Eagle River Bridge has reopened to traffic (two lanes). Third left lane remains closed for further repairs.</li>
        <li>Glenn Highway: Northbound Palmer Flyover approach is now open to one lane.</li>
      </ul>
<p>All DOT&amp;PF bridge inspectors are now in Southcentral Alaska and are conducting technical bridge inspections. Two inspection teams are covering the Glenn and Parks Highways, a third team is covering the Anchorage urban area, and a fourth inspection team is inspecting the bases of high mast towers. At  this point, 44 high priority structures have been inspected. </p>
<p>Due to extensive damage on the Glenn Highway, between miles 23-25 (Eklutna to Mirror Lake), DOT&amp;PF is requesting that other state agencies  keep employees at home, if possible. The Glenn Highway remains open but will be limited to one lane of traffic in either direction through the Eklutna to Mirror Lake section. DOT&amp;PF is advising that if travel is not essential, please avoid the area.</p>
<p>DOT&amp;PF is also requesting that long combination vehicles (doubles) limit the hours of travel of <u>southbound</u> loads on the Glenn Highway to midnight-5 a.m. This will help mitigate the  significant traffic congestion. While there is a detour through this area, it  is not wide enough for double loads to easily travel through, which causes additional traffic delays. Northbound long combination vehicles (doubles) are not impacted by this notice. We recognize that this greatly impacts operations. We are working as quickly as possible to complete the necessary repairs and  open roads again. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>DOT&amp;PF 24 hour operations center will continue to issue  situation reports. Please expect the next situation report at approximately 6 p.m. Sunday, December 2.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn Highway</strong><br>
  Glenn Highway Northbound @ Eagle River Bridge: Highway has opened to two lanes. Speed limit is 45 mph. Paving the area will occur in upcoming weeks.
