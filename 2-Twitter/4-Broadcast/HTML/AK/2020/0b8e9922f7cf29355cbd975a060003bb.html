Her first visit to the station was as a guest on the morning show ' FOX 51 Today' to talk about her upcoming competition 'Miss Texas USA'. Less than a year later, Rachel found herself in the anchor chair of that very same morning show.\n\nIn 2015, Rachel moved to New Mexico and took on the role of morning and noon anchor at KOB in Albuquerque. \n\nShe then moved back to Texas and worked as a general assignment reporter at CBS 11 in Dallas; covering stories such as the deadly 2018 Dallas natural gas explosion and the Atlanta airport power outages.\n\nRachel is a passionate animal advocate. While at KETK in Tyler, she started a weekly animal adoption segment and investigated the growing animal abuse in East Texas. She continued her work with animal rescues while in Albuquerque and expanded her adoption outreach segments during the noon newscast she anchored.\n\nWhen Rachel isn't at work you can find her with her senior Shih Tzu, Tiny Dog, working on her next arts and crafts project, or volunteering at an animal shelter.\n\nFeel free to send her an email or stop by on Facebook or Twitter to share a story

Ross started attending storm spotter training classes with his dad while he was still in middle school because he wanted to learn more about thunderstorms.\n\nIn high school, Ross started interning at KWCH in hopes of learning more about weather and forecasting, and to see firsthand what the broadcast world included. With the help of a charitable foundation in Ellsworth, Ross was able to install a weather station in the high school so that other students could watch the weather change throughout the day.\n\nRoss attended college at the University of Kansas and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Atmospheric Science. His broadcast career started at 19 years of age at Channel 6 in Lawrence where he had the opportunity to work as both the morning meteorologist and as a Chief for about 2 years. Ross has done some fill in work at WIBW in Topeka, and then moved to Wichita in 2004 to work at KWCH. He earned the National Weather Association Seal of Approval in 2004, and received the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation in 2006 from the American Meteorological Society.\n\nRoss doesn't have a great deal of spare time, but when possible, he loves mowing and landscape. He also loves traveling back home to help on the family farm and ranch. You will also see his beautiful corgi May on the air in the evenings.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2022-07-22T21:14:24.983Z","custom_gray_stationname":"kwch","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Janssen12","personal_website":"https://www.kwch.com/weather/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/KWCHRoss"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T21:11:12.054Z","description":{"basic":"More much needed rain on the way; a few severe storms"},"headlines":{"basic":"Scattered storms into Thursday","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/rBIe7cRDhHzv5s_V3ipplHdrvRE=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"3.png","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","owner":"rjanssen@kwch.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/rBIe7cRDhHzv5s_V3ipplHdrvRE=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/rBIe7cRDhHzv5s_V3ipplHdrvRE=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/Lx9LNYzjYCjXqxnM7zbIjomt8AU=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","usage_instructions":"Cleared to use","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"ed2138baa76a6d3f349774057d34693bf549266a84be81222190f19bb11849a7"},"caption":"A few severe storms on the way","created_date":"2024-05-29T21:10:54Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"KWCH","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":1080,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-29T21:10:54Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Severe weather scale","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/HNIWZGRJC5AZPJPLB4ZOQ3IOPM.png","version":"0.10.9","width":1920,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"KWCH"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"kwch":{"website_section":{"path":"/news","_website":"kwch","name":"News","_id":"/news","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/30/ross-6pm-forecast/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"kwch","websites":{"kwch":{"website_section":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"kwch","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"kwch","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1022},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"kwch./weather/forecast"},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/scattered-storms-into-thursday/"}},"_id":"YFRFXMNQFZFJBIGEHKXYYZ6SAU","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"kwch","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"kwch","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1022},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"kwch./weather/forecast"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/scattered-storms-into-thursday/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/28/andover-teen-finishes-top-45-scripps-national-spelling-bee/","content_elements":[{"_id":"SOWZZCOPNBA7ZFLL5WCENLQULA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"5345WX6DGRGH3HQZXLFY7EZCFE","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"WICHITA, Kan.
