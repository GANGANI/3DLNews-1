","longBio":"Hailing from Syracuse, Chad Charette's interest in journalism was sparked in high school when he helped to establish a student-run newspaper. \nHe fell in love with broadcasting during his undergraduate years at the University of Hartford in Connecticut.  There, he served as an anchor and reporter for the school’s Student Television network “STN2”. At the start of 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic and the tail end of his sophomore year, Chad took on the role of news director, gaining invaluable reporting experience. \nChad graduated in May 2022 with a degree in digital media and journalism and joined the 7 News team less than a month later. At 7 News, he works as a reporter/multimedia journalist and always relishes the opportunity to jump into the field and do a story.\nWhen he’s not on the job, Chad enjoys researching historical sights, playing video games, running, and pretty much anything that gives him an excuse to ride a boat. He loves to travel and would eventually like to take a bike tour across Europe.\nAs a bit of a fun fact, Chad actually made his on-air debut as a child when he appeared in a commercial for a barbecue restaurant in his hometown. The commercial itself has not yet resurfaced.

The facts are clear: this was a zombie case illegally brought forward by a corrupt prosecutor doing Joe Biden’s political bidding in a desperate attempt to save Joe Biden’s failing campaign. The case hinged on the testimony of a convicted felon who was disbarred for lying and perjured himself when he lied to Congress. This sham trial was overseen by a corrupt and highly unethical Judge who is a Biden donor and whose own family has directly profited from this case. This corrupt Democrat Judge imposed a clearly unconstitutional gag order on President Trump and his team. This corrupt Democrat Judge routinely sided with the prosecution and prevented President Trump’s defense from calling a critical witness to the stand. The prosecution team that brought forward this case consisted of a Soros-funded Far Left Democrat District Attorney on a vendetta, Democrat political operatives, and Democrat donors. From the start, the weaponized scales of justice were stacked against President Trump. Joe Biden, Far Left Democrats, and their stenographers in the mainstream media have made it clear they will stop at nothing to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House. We must work around the clock to ensure President Trump is victorious this November to save America from Biden’s failed Far Left Democrat agenda and the illegal weaponization of the justice system against the American people.”"},{"_id":"MEPHVOBFM5CUPDMDR3NTNDSINM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"<i>The following is Tenney’s statement:</i>"},{"_id":"2IIKTOIMFBHGRKLWB32VFT4WDA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"“This trial was never about the rule of law, it was a shameless attempt to silence President Trump.

He imposed unnecessary and unconstitutional gag orders on President Trump, effectively silencing him and hindering his ability to campaign freely. Judge Merchan engaged in obvious and unethical bias in a rush to get a guilty verdict, not to ensure justice under the law. Our country was founded on the principle of blind justice, but the Left has weaponized our legal system, trampling this core principle of our nation. This alarming abuse of power underscores a deeply troubling reality: we have a politicized, two-tiered system of justice in America.”"}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"7-news-staff","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"7 News Staff","org":"Watertown,
