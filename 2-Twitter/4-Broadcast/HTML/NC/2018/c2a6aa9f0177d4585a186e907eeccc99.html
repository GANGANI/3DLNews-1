","longBio":"Claire Kopsky joined the WBTV team as a reporter in June 2023.\n\nShe is an Emmy award-winning reporter with nearly a decade of experience telling stories. In her reporting in Nashville, Tenn.; Lexington, Ky.; and mid-Missouri, she's covered the gamut: breaking state and city political news; historic flooding, snow and tornado devastation; a governor's indictment; multi-part investigations exposing corrupt local education leaders; three Kentucky Derbys; stories of social injustices; features about people making a difference; and stories about the lives of those with special needs. \n\nWhile reporting at the CBS affiliate WTVF in Nashville, where she focused on feature and special project stories, her coverage of the disability community earned her the 2022 Arc Tennessee Public Awareness Award—awarded annually to one journalist state-wide—specifically for a story that helped change a law to increase the number of adult-size changing tables in the state. She was also nominated for two Emmy Awards for her coverage of the unhoused community in downtown Nashville and for her helicopter reporting during the aftermath of The Covenant School shooting.\n\nIn Lexington at the NBC affiliate WLEX, where she was a reporter and anchor, Claire received an Emmy Award for her reporting at the Kentucky Derby. She started her career as a multimedia journalist and anchor in the heart of the Show-Me State at the NBC affiliate KOMU in Columbia, Missouri. \n\nHer work has been picked up by the Associated Press, CBS News, CBS Mornings, CBS Evening News, CBS Weekend Roundup, Good Morning America, CNN, MSNBC, Inside Edition and US News and World Report.\n\nClaire graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism and earned a degree in convergence journalism with an emphasis in television reporting, and a minor in business. Her experience extends beyond television. Claire worked in digital, print, broadcast and multimedia newsrooms. She reported in Beijing, China, at the China Open Tennis Tournament, for a print and digital magazine in London, United Kingdom, and worked for a digital startup in New York City.\n\nClaire enjoys volunteering in her free time for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA)/Guardian at Litem (GAL), an organization that helps children who are abused and/or neglected find their voice in the courtroom against their abusers.\n\nShe also enjoys time outdoors hiking, quality time with family and friends, photography, and singing. Claire is a foodie to the core and is always looking for new restaurants to try! You’ll find her cheering on her favorite baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals, rallying around the Mizzou Tigers, and chipping balls on the nearest green. She is originally from St. Louis, Missouri, and is thrilled to be in the Queen City telling stories about the spirited people of North Carolina!\n\nClaire believes everyone has a story to share and would love to hear from you! If you’d like to connect or have a tip, let Claire know as she would be delighted to sit down and speak with you! Feel free to reach out to her on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Threads or via email!","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T21:44:21.366Z","twitter":"@ClaireMKopsky","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ckopsky/","instagram":"@clairekopsky","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2","custom_gray_stationname":"wbtv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T10:30:47.543Z","description":{"basic":"Christopher

While there, David uncovered law enforcement was illegally conducting video surveillance that wasn’t disclosed to the courts, exposed a taxpayer-funded city council donation fund used to give money to churches and non-profits, and revealed numerous problems with rules and regulations that hold shady contractors accountable. \n\nHis first job in television was at WFFF in Burlington, Vt. That's where he covered local and state government and started a “You Paid For It” series highlighting questionable uses of taxpayer money. \n\nDavid moved to Charlotte with his wife who is a mental health therapist specializing in helping children in crisis.\n\nOriginally from Jacksonville, FL, David is a huge Jacksonville Jaguars fan (sorry, David!). Since he has no true loyalty to an NBA team he decided to adopt the Charlotte Hornets. More than anything he's excited about getting to know the people of Charlotte and helping the people who need it.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"Investigative Reporter","slug":"","status":true,"twitter":"@hodgesreporting","type":"author","last_updated_date":"2023-09-05T20:55:47.215Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbtv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"investigative","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:52:14.234Z","description":{"basic":"The agreement could pave the way for construction of the Red Line to North Meck, as well as a one-cent sales tax for transit"},"headlines":{"basic":"Sources: City of Charlotte nears agreement for Norfolk Southern rail line","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/8w5sEhd-7PGNjjyksC6yf6EINjY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA.jpeg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_source":"269861905","keywords":["curve","direction","iron","journey","line","metal","perspective","rail","railroad","rails","railway","road","station","steel","stone","track","tracks","train","transport","transportation","travel","trees","way"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"AdobeStock_269861905.jpeg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA.jpeg","owner":"jenna.wood@wbrc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/8w5sEhd-7PGNjjyksC6yf6EINjY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA.jpeg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/8w5sEhd-7PGNjjyksC6yf6EINjY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA.jpeg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2019-05-26T11:16:15Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/Y2c0N6cl3JSl6nE84cmn8RXSuVA=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/D7XU3SOP7BDQFAUDHPL2KGTHDA.jpeg","usage_instructions":"clear","version":0,"template_id":39},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"d9e6c42d44cc5df623f6b6e8e410a5c6d8cee0465901a4df784d1425e0230120"},"caption":"Train tracks","copyright":"Brinkweg 1\r31855 Aerzen","created_date":"2024-02-20T22:12:37Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Ulf -

In his free time, he loves watching a good movie, hiking, and trying to break 100 on the golf course. \n\nIf you have any athletes or stories that deserve coverage, feel free to reach out to Cam at cameron.gaskins@wbtv.com, or on Twitter @CamGaskinsTV!

She earned her master’s degree in Geoscience, with an emphasis in Broadcast Meteorology, from Mississippi State University.  She also holds the AMS Seal of Approval from the American Meteorological Society.\n\nElissia loves to travel and spend time with friends and family.

","longBio":"Claire Kopsky joined the WBTV team as a reporter in June 2023.\n\nShe is an Emmy award-winning reporter with nearly a decade of experience telling stories. In her reporting in Nashville, Tenn.; Lexington, Ky.; and mid-Missouri, she's covered the gamut: breaking state and city political news; historic flooding, snow and tornado devastation; a governor's indictment; multi-part investigations exposing corrupt local education leaders; three Kentucky Derbys; stories of social injustices; features about people making a difference; and stories about the lives of those with special needs. \n\nWhile reporting at the CBS affiliate WTVF in Nashville, where she focused on feature and special project stories, her coverage of the disability community earned her the 2022 Arc Tennessee Public Awareness Award—awarded annually to one journalist state-wide—specifically for a story that helped change a law to increase the number of adult-size changing tables in the state. She was also nominated for two Emmy Awards for her coverage of the unhoused community in downtown Nashville and for her helicopter reporting during the aftermath of The Covenant School shooting.\n\nIn Lexington at the NBC affiliate WLEX, where she was a reporter and anchor, Claire received an Emmy Award for her reporting at the Kentucky Derby. She started her career as a multimedia journalist and anchor in the heart of the Show-Me State at the NBC affiliate KOMU in Columbia, Missouri. \n\nHer work has been picked up by the Associated Press, CBS News, CBS Mornings, CBS Evening News, CBS Weekend Roundup, Good Morning America, CNN, MSNBC, Inside Edition and US News and World Report.\n\nClaire graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism and earned a degree in convergence journalism with an emphasis in television reporting, and a minor in business. Her experience extends beyond television. Claire worked in digital, print, broadcast and multimedia newsrooms. She reported in Beijing, China, at the China Open Tennis Tournament, for a print and digital magazine in London, United Kingdom, and worked for a digital startup in New York City.\n\nClaire enjoys volunteering in her free time for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA)/Guardian at Litem (GAL), an organization that helps children who are abused and/or neglected find their voice in the courtroom against their abusers.\n\nShe also enjoys time outdoors hiking, quality time with family and friends, photography, and singing. Claire is a foodie to the core and is always looking for new restaurants to try! You’ll find her cheering on her favorite baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals, rallying around the Mizzou Tigers, and chipping balls on the nearest green. She is originally from St. Louis, Missouri, and is thrilled to be in the Queen City telling stories about the spirited people of North Carolina!\n\nClaire believes everyone has a story to share and would love to hear from you! If you’d like to connect or have a tip, let Claire know as she would be delighted to sit down and speak with you!

While there, David uncovered law enforcement was illegally conducting video surveillance that wasn’t disclosed to the courts, exposed a taxpayer-funded city council donation fund used to give money to churches and non-profits, and revealed numerous problems with rules and regulations that hold shady contractors accountable. \n\nHis first job in television was at WFFF in Burlington, Vt. That's where he covered local and state government and started a “You Paid For It” series highlighting questionable uses of taxpayer money. \n\nDavid moved to Charlotte with his wife who is a mental health therapist specializing in helping children in crisis.\n\nOriginally from Jacksonville, FL, David is a huge Jacksonville Jaguars fan (sorry, David!). Since he has no true loyalty to an NBA team he decided to adopt the Charlotte Hornets.

Just days into the job, he found himself pinned down taking cover behind police cars while officers and a gunman exchanged fire. \n\nTwo years later, Ron took a job across the street at KFMB-TV as a sound technician and later promoted to news photographer, learning the tricks of the trade from some of the best in the business. \n\nRon made the jump to the east coast when he accepted a position in Columbia, South Carolina, working for WIS-TV. Years later, he was offered a position at the ABC affiliate in Charlotte as a photojournalist in 1993. It was there Ron covered such news events as the crash of a DC-9 at Charlotte/Douglas International, and the tragic story of the Susan Smith trial in Union, South Carolina. \n\nWanting to expand his experiences, Ron accepted a job as the Chief Photographer in Charleston, South Carolina, at WCIV-TV NewsChannel 4. That position put him in charge of training the next generation of reporters and photographers where he spent three years. \n\nThen in 1998, he came back to Charlotte to work for WBTV, where he’s been for over 20 years. Starting as a news photographer, he rose through the ranks working his way into a management position, then eventually into an on-air reporting position. Some of Ron’s most notable stories included covering the attacks on the towers in New York on 9/11 and the Democratic National Convention in 2012.\n\nMost recently, Ron has hit the speaking circuit, going all across the country training bloggers and video journalists techniques to improve their craft. On his off time, Ron is an avid motorcycle rider making the yearly trek to Sturgis, South Dakota, for the Black Hills Rally. \n\nHe also works with several animal rescue groups fostering dogs hoping to find them forever homes.","org":"WBTV","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter,

Degree in Meteorology and also had the opportunity to play on the women’s basketball team for a few years.\n\nEven though she started school wanting to go into research, a couple of internships at WRAL and WGAL and a student-run show, Weather Watch, revealed a love for forecasting and communicating the weather to others that remains today. \n\nRachel is coming to Charlotte from Jackson, Mississippi, where she spent the past three years at WBTV’s sister station, WLBT. The three years prior were spent at KAIT, in Jonesboro, Arkansas.\n\nAfter seeing her fair share of severe weather events in the Mid and Deep South, Rachel looks forward to the new forecasting challenges the Carolinas have to offer! She is also eager to learn from the best and work alongside the amazing team of meteorologists at WBTV.

NBA Finals when he fell in love for the first time. \n\nColton looked on with his father from the comfort of their couch in downtown Minneapolis Minnesota, as Philadelphia 76ers point guard Allen Iverson dropped Los Angeles Lakers guard Tyronn Lue with the coldest crossover he had ever seen, before sinking a bucket and stepping over Lue, seemingly snatching his soul from his body in the process. \n\nSince then, Colton has been in love with sports.\n\nA few months later, on the same couch, Colton heard the silky voice of broadcaster Al Michaels while watching the Baltimore Ravens take on the Pittsburgh Steelers. As Michaels’ smooth, enthusiastic pitch took over the game, Colton decided to work in television.\n\nHis goal was to take Michaels’ job.\n\nMany years later, Colton attended Minnesota State University, Mankato, graduating with a journalism and broadcasting degree. While in college, he worked for the athletic department as the women’s hockey play-by-play broadcaster. \n\nColton also worked as a reporter for the school paper, The Reporter, and started an internship covering college sports for SB Nation. He also added a job covering the Minnesota Golden Gophers and Minnesota Timberwolves for ZoneCoverage.com.\n\nColton started his television career at KSFY in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where he worked as the Morning Reporter from 2019 to 2020 before joining the morning crew at NBC 15 in November of 2020.\n\nWhether covering the Super Bowl, a state fair or a new restaurant, Colton’s goal is to tell you a new story.\n\nFeel free to contact Colton with any story ideas, questions or comments.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":false,"last_updated_date":"2023-09-18T21:02:52.679Z","twitter":"@CMoleskyNBC15","instagram":"colton_molesky","youtube":"Colton
