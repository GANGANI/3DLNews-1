As part of that, he related various encounters with angels, including Carlos Santana's encounter with what may have been the angel Metatron, before moving on to angel lore and other angelic encounters. He said the angel study was an important component of his book. “We put that together right at the beginning of developing the book,” he told George. While that 75% belief rate reflects attitudes about angels seen across the United States, it isn’t the same around the world. In fact, the U.S. leads the Christian world in belief of angels, according to Guerin. “In other parts of the world, it’s less than that. But [with] Islam, actually, belief in angels is one of the five pillars of faith. You have to believe in angels. So, the Muslim community, obviously, (scores) very high.” \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Guerin talked about his own spiritual journey as well, including meeting his spirit animal and developing his sense of psychic intuition. He also shared some of the stories from his book, such as a woman who, angry at her husband, went out for a run. During her run, she had an encounter with another fitness buff who gave her unsolicited advice without being told about her situation, which matched what had been on her mind before he joined her and urged her to “try forgiveness.” Several callers reached out to share their own angelic experiences and asked questions toward the end of Dr. Guerin's segment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Some cryptid researchers operate on the premise that they are tracking a flesh and blood creature – one that hasn't been cataloged yet but otherwise operates on the same level as other biological creatures. Then there are those who believe that Bigfoot and other cryptids may be a little more supernatural. \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/jessica-jones/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Jones\u003c/a>, the self-styled Cryptid Huntress, falls into this second camp, describing herself as &quot;proudly&quot; on the &quot;woo&quot; end of the spectrum. She explained to George in the second half of the show how experiences like being tripped by an invisible Bigfoot helped led her to this more esoteric view. She also discussed UFO and other paranormal experiences occurring in conjunction with Bigfoot sightings, and her use of remote viewing in her search for unknown creatures.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“I’ve always had a connection to the paranormal, ever since I was a little kid,” Jones explained. “When I was a kid, I used to see ghosts, and I would take my little nap mat out to the front yard… and I would look for UFOs at night.” As she grew older, she noted, these experiences continued until “it just kind of came across my path one day to become a Bigfoot field researcher.” She began doing Bigfoot field research in 2011, working across the South, mostly in Georgia. Alabama and surrounding states. She said while Bigfoot is the main focus, her groups have also investigated Dogman sightings and even reports of what may have possibly been a Wendigo – though she acknowledged the cannibal of Algonquin legend was far outside its legendary range in the American South.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>George closed the evening by sharing a segment from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2015-02-17-show/\" target=\"_blank\">February 17, 2015\u003c/a>, show when Wes Germer discussed his experience being surrounded by a group of Bigfoot. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>News Segment Guests: \u003ca href=\"http://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Bloom\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mish Shedlock\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://welcomevillain.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Henes &amp; Matthew Merenda\u003c/a> \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Angels-Guide-Understanding-Connecting/dp/B0CM37TVY5/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Looking for Angels\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Training-Scott-Guerin-Ph-D/dp/0578593963/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angel In Training: A Spiritual Journey\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/12-Lessons-Forward-Angel-Training/dp/0578693089/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">12 Lessons: A Path Forward\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"I've Got You Under My Skin","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LOI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002JK4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It's Worth","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002IAZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Remastered-Basswolf/dp/B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Tom Jones","title":"Delilah","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050O1I/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"The Magnificent Seven","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004BZ16/ctoc"},{"artist":"Seal","title":"Love's Divine","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AA489/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma ","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"Where Or When","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C9ZEX/ctoc"},{"artist":"Wilco","title":"Shouldn't Be Ashamed","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002MWY/ctoc"},{"artist":"Golden Earring","title":"Radar Love","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002O6P/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Sadeness-Part-1-Enigma/dp/B000005JWS/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Love Her Madly","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H22/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F664fce6439e376d297b9ae56","%2F664fd02eef48656841176636"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angels","keywords/angelic encounters","keywords/cryptid research","keywords/ETs"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585b9b5f19a78673937023","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585baf5f19a78673937024","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bbe5f19a78673937025","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bce5f19a78673937026","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystical fantasy concept.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He said the angel study was an important component of his book. “We put that together right at the beginning of developing the book,” he told George. While that 75% belief rate reflects attitudes about angels seen across the United States, it isn’t the same around the world. In fact, the U.S. leads the Christian world in belief of angels, according to Guerin. “In other parts of the world, it’s less than that. But [with] Islam, actually, belief in angels is one of the five pillars of faith. You have to believe in angels. So, the Muslim community, obviously, (scores) very high.” \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Guerin talked about his own spiritual journey as well, including meeting his spirit animal and developing his sense of psychic intuition. He also shared some of the stories from his book, such as a woman who, angry at her husband, went out for a run. During her run, she had an encounter with another fitness buff who gave her unsolicited advice without being told about her situation, which matched what had been on her mind before he joined her and urged her to “try forgiveness.” Several callers reached out to share their own angelic experiences and asked questions toward the end of Dr. Guerin's segment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Some cryptid researchers operate on the premise that they are tracking a flesh and blood creature – one that hasn't been cataloged yet but otherwise operates on the same level as other biological creatures. Then there are those who believe that Bigfoot and other cryptids may be a little more supernatural. \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/jessica-jones/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Jones\u003c/a>, the self-styled Cryptid Huntress, falls into this second camp, describing herself as &quot;proudly&quot; on the &quot;woo&quot; end of the spectrum. She explained to George in the second half of the show how experiences like being tripped by an invisible Bigfoot helped led her to this more esoteric view. She also discussed UFO and other paranormal experiences occurring in conjunction with Bigfoot sightings, and her use of remote viewing in her search for unknown creatures.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“I’ve always had a connection to the paranormal, ever since I was a little kid,” Jones explained. “When I was a kid, I used to see ghosts, and I would take my little nap mat out to the front yard… and I would look for UFOs at night.” As she grew older, she noted, these experiences continued until “it just kind of came across my path one day to become a Bigfoot field researcher.” She began doing Bigfoot field research in 2011, working across the South, mostly in Georgia. Alabama and surrounding states. She said while Bigfoot is the main focus, her groups have also investigated Dogman sightings and even reports of what may have possibly been a Wendigo – though she acknowledged the cannibal of Algonquin legend was far outside its legendary range in the American South.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>George closed the evening by sharing a segment from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2015-02-17-show/\" target=\"_blank\">February 17, 2015\u003c/a>, show when Wes Germer discussed his experience being surrounded by a group of Bigfoot. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>News Segment Guests: \u003ca href=\"http://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Bloom\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mish Shedlock\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://welcomevillain.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Henes &amp; Matthew Merenda\u003c/a> \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Angels-Guide-Understanding-Connecting/dp/B0CM37TVY5/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Looking for Angels\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Training-Scott-Guerin-Ph-D/dp/0578593963/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angel In Training: A Spiritual Journey\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/12-Lessons-Forward-Angel-Training/dp/0578693089/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">12 Lessons: A Path Forward\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"I've Got You Under My Skin","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LOI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002JK4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It's Worth","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002IAZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Remastered-Basswolf/dp/B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Tom Jones","title":"Delilah","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050O1I/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"The Magnificent Seven","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004BZ16/ctoc"},{"artist":"Seal","title":"Love's Divine","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AA489/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma ","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"Where Or When","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C9ZEX/ctoc"},{"artist":"Wilco","title":"Shouldn't Be Ashamed","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002MWY/ctoc"},{"artist":"Golden Earring","title":"Radar Love","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002O6P/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Sadeness-Part-1-Enigma/dp/B000005JWS/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Love Her Madly","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H22/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F664fce6439e376d297b9ae56","%2F664fd02eef48656841176636"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angels","keywords/angelic encounters","keywords/cryptid research","keywords/ETs"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585b9b5f19a78673937023","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585baf5f19a78673937024","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bbe5f19a78673937025","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bce5f19a78673937026","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystical fantasy concept.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

As part of that, he related various encounters with angels, including Carlos Santana's encounter with what may have been the angel Metatron, before moving on to angel lore and other angelic encounters. He said the angel study was an important component of his book. “We put that together right at the beginning of developing the book,” he told George. While that 75% belief rate reflects attitudes about angels seen across the United States, it isn’t the same around the world. In fact, the U.S. leads the Christian world in belief of angels, according to Guerin. “In other parts of the world, it’s less than that. But [with] Islam, actually, belief in angels is one of the five pillars of faith. You have to believe in angels. So, the Muslim community, obviously, (scores) very high.” \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Guerin talked about his own spiritual journey as well, including meeting his spirit animal and developing his sense of psychic intuition. He also shared some of the stories from his book, such as a woman who, angry at her husband, went out for a run. During her run, she had an encounter with another fitness buff who gave her unsolicited advice without being told about her situation, which matched what had been on her mind before he joined her and urged her to “try forgiveness.” Several callers reached out to share their own angelic experiences and asked questions toward the end of Dr. Guerin's segment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Some cryptid researchers operate on the premise that they are tracking a flesh and blood creature – one that hasn't been cataloged yet but otherwise operates on the same level as other biological creatures. Then there are those who believe that Bigfoot and other cryptids may be a little more supernatural. \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/jessica-jones/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Jones\u003c/a>, the self-styled Cryptid Huntress, falls into this second camp, describing herself as &quot;proudly&quot; on the &quot;woo&quot; end of the spectrum. She explained to George in the second half of the show how experiences like being tripped by an invisible Bigfoot helped led her to this more esoteric view. She also discussed UFO and other paranormal experiences occurring in conjunction with Bigfoot sightings, and her use of remote viewing in her search for unknown creatures.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“I’ve always had a connection to the paranormal, ever since I was a little kid,” Jones explained. “When I was a kid, I used to see ghosts, and I would take my little nap mat out to the front yard… and I would look for UFOs at night.” As she grew older, she noted, these experiences continued until “it just kind of came across my path one day to become a Bigfoot field researcher.” She began doing Bigfoot field research in 2011, working across the South, mostly in Georgia. Alabama and surrounding states. She said while Bigfoot is the main focus, her groups have also investigated Dogman sightings and even reports of what may have possibly been a Wendigo – though she acknowledged the cannibal of Algonquin legend was far outside its legendary range in the American South.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>George closed the evening by sharing a segment from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2015-02-17-show/\" target=\"_blank\">February 17, 2015\u003c/a>, show when Wes Germer discussed his experience being surrounded by a group of Bigfoot. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>News Segment Guests: \u003ca href=\"http://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">Howard Bloom\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">Mish Shedlock\u003c/a> / \u003ca href=\"http://welcomevillain.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Henes &amp; Matthew Merenda\u003c/a> \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Angels-Guide-Understanding-Connecting/dp/B0CM37TVY5/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Looking for Angels\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Training-Scott-Guerin-Ph-D/dp/0578593963/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angel In Training: A Spiritual Journey\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/12-Lessons-Forward-Angel-Training/dp/0578693089/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">12 Lessons: A Path Forward\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"I've Got You Under My Skin","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LOI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002JK4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It's Worth","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002IAZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Remastered-Basswolf/dp/B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Tom Jones","title":"Delilah","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050O1I/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"The Magnificent Seven","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004BZ16/ctoc"},{"artist":"Seal","title":"Love's Divine","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AA489/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma ","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"Where Or When","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C9ZEX/ctoc"},{"artist":"Wilco","title":"Shouldn't Be Ashamed","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002MWY/ctoc"},{"artist":"Golden Earring","title":"Radar Love","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002O6P/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Sadeness-Part-1-Enigma/dp/B000005JWS/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Love Her Madly","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H22/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F664fce6439e376d297b9ae56","%2F664fd02eef48656841176636"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angels","keywords/angelic encounters","keywords/cryptid research","keywords/ETs"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585b9b5f19a78673937023","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585baf5f19a78673937024","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bbe5f19a78673937025","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66585bce5f19a78673937026","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 29 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystical fantasy concept.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Referencing biblical figures like Adam, Noah, and Methuselah, who were said to have lived for hundreds of years, he connected their longevity to the notion that they inhabited the &quot;land and milk honey.&quot; Wallach suggested that this milk was &quot;glacial milk&quot;-- ground-up rocks at the top of glaciers that released white silt, heavy in minerals that flowed into streams, which the biblical-era figures drank, and this greatly increased their lifespans.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wallach announced the publication of his new book on metabolic syndrome (related conditions said to increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). About 1/3 of American adults have the syndrome, he reported, but rather than a genetic problem, he attributes it to nutritional deficiencies and not avoiding the &quot;bad stuff,&quot; which he listed as fried foods, processed meat, oils, gluten soy, wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwheat, sugar, and carbonated drinks. In response to a caller's inquiry about Bell's palsy, Wallach said he believes the condition is due to the cramping of a cranial nerve from osteoporosis and can be reversed with the proper nutrients that rebuild the myelin in the brain and spinal cord.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Chemist \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307122042/https://alienevidenceinc.webs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Colbern\u003c/a>, who specializes in materials science, says that he and his wife displayed evidence of being visited and implanted by the alien Greys. In the latter half, he shared his research about Mars-- he believes that plant life and past civilizations on the Red Planet have been covered up and also updated his work with the late Dr. Roger Leir, whom he initially contacted for the removal of an alien implant in his toe. Regarding Mars, Colbern asserted that evidence for plant life has been seen clearly in the Orbiter mission photos, as well as huge trees near the planet's south pole. In the rover photographs, there's what looks like foundations of buildings, as well as metallic junk and crash debris, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One Roper poll reported that about 3% of the public has been affected by alien abduction at least once, and according to Colburn's research, about .1% of the population &quot;are Class II experiencers that are actually part of the alien program.&quot; Hybrids are the primary purpose of the program, he continued, though abductions seem to be decreasing in number. The hybrids, raised aboard their ships, look mostly indistinguishable from regular humans, he noted, and the Greys' agenda is to use them to repopulate our planet after a devastating war or pandemic. &quot;But they're not going to do anything to us; they're going to wait for us to do it to ourselves,&quot; Colburn clarified. He shared that the Greys have said they hail from planets within 100 light years, and are part of an alliance of seven similar species. In addition to the alien implant he had removed, he believes he still has several others embedded in him, including one &quot;that started giving out radio signals when I was doing a Japanese TV show.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the last half-hour, George featured his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2021-06-28-show/\" target=\"_blank\">6/28/21\u003c/a> interview with hypnotherapist Barbara Lamb on children's ET encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he discussed the FBI Highway Serial Killings Initiative and their hunt for individuals who have accounted for an astonishing 850 murders across the nation. The cases he's investigated are primarily unsolved murders of sex trafficking victims committed by long-haul truckers, with around 450 active suspects, though some are believed to have multiple victims. A small minority of long-haul truckers exploit jurisdictional seams to traffic and kill sex workers, often with decades-long delays in identifying victims and catching killers, Figliuzzi reported.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He further explained how the perpetrator will grab a victim at one location, often at or near a truck stop, related to some kind of sex for money transaction. Then, they'll rape and/or murder the victim in a second jurisdiction, and dispose of the body in a third location. Among the cases he detailed was that of serial killer Robert Ben Rhoades, a truck driver from Houston who was convicted of killing a teenage girl and her boyfriend, though he was additionally linked to other murders. Figliuzzi also delved into the dark side of the trucking industry, including alcoholism and depression, and noted that the profession needs more support and recognition.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"http://www.joediamondlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Diamond\u003c/a>, the official Mind Reader at the Maxwell Mansion in Lake Geneva, WI, talked about his latest appearance on Penn &amp; Teller's Fool Us TV show, haunted locations, and the power of mental telepathy. On the Penn &amp; Teller program, which was filmed live on a Las Vegas stage, he successfully pulled off a mind reading with a deck of cards, and gave the host Brooke Burke a palm reading (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kql5oar-UIE\" target=\"_blank\">view clip\u003c/a>). He shared tales of hauntings at the Maxwell Mansion, where a wide variety of apparitions have been seen. The house was originally built in 1855 by Dr. Philip Maxwell, who conducted surgeries in the basement where the speakeasy is now. Diamond suspects that some of the patients died there and are perhaps the ones haunting the hotel, and this accounts for why so many different ghosts are seen.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He recounted how one evening, when he was reading a book and having a drink in the speakeasy by himself, he saw the reflection of a person in the mirror, but when he looked over in their direction, there was no one there. Diamond described his readings using psychometry (gleaning knowledge by touching an object) and how, lately, he's been experimenting with receiving telepathic messages from extraterrestrials during readings, which sometimes involve the use of a pendulum. During the last hour, he offered Tarot readings for callers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://theskylive.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Long-Haul-Hunting-Highway-Killers/dp/006326515X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Long Haul: Hunting the Highway Serial Killers\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Rhythm of the Wilderness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Cusco-2000/dp/B000003YZQ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sammy Davis Jr.","title":"I’ve Gotta Be Me","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Collection-Sammy-Davis-Jr/dp/B000CQQHFY/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Little By Little","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00122JZL0"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Riders on the Storm","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H22/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Ghost Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YXL/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frankie Avalon","title":"Venus","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S9DRMQ"},{"artist":"INXS","title":"Beautiful Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066ROB/ctoc"},{"artist":"Tears for Fears","title":"Everybody Wants to Rule the World","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NERW/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"TNT For the Brain","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"All or Nothing at All","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FB0HDMM"},{"artist":"Dave Matthews Band","title":"Two Step","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002WYT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Peter Gabriel","title":"Shock the Monkey","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065V9S/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Beyond the Invisible","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Enigma-Love-Sensuality-Devotion-Greatest/dp/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sam Cooke","title":"Cupid","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000006389/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F664fcd1a5ac74f579aba4ebe","%2F6049bd641a46a6fe9fc0b4ea"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/serial killers","keywords/Mind-reading","keywords/telepathy","keywords/hauntings"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6655b880cd4c2ea1c8dc66bc","show":"coast","title":"Mon, May 27 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6655b89fcd4c2ea1c8dc66bd","show":"coast","title":"Mon, May 27 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6655b8bacd4c2ea1c8dc66be","show":"coast","title":"Mon, May 27 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6655b8d2cd4c2ea1c8dc66bf","show":"coast","title":"Mon, May 27 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Looking at the back of a hooded figure looking out on a motorway and traffic trails on a moody foggy winters night.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

This policy ended up holding back therapeutic research of psychedelic drugs like LSD for decades, he pointed out. During WWII, the Nazis had experimented with psychedelic compounds on prisoners in a concentration camp outside Munich to try and extract secrets like the drug was a 'truth serum,' he recounted. Ohler traced the beginning of the drug war to 1945 in post-war Berlin, when drug use was rampant, and America sent the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Arthur J. Giuliani, to the divided city to regulate the situation. He pushed for the prohibition of various substances, which ended up becoming a kind of blueprint for drug policy around the world.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ohler sought out information in the archives of the Novartis pharmaceutical company (which had merged with Sandoz, the company that initially synthesized LSD). During the Cold War, the CIA bought a huge stockpile of LSD from Sandoz in Switzerland to conduct experiments and tried to convince the company only to sell it to Western countries, he reported. In recent years, studies have shown that in low doses or microdoses, LSD could be effective for a variety of conditions and diseases like dementia. &quot;LSD is a disruption of your brain chemistry...for not only for those hours while it lasts, but they found that up to two weeks afterwards, your brain is still animated from that experience and creates new neurons,&quot; he remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Bordering TN and KY, legends abound in the Land Between the Lakes. In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.heystrangeness.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Deese\u003c/a>, researcher and former editor of Paranormality Magazine, revealed how this stretch of untamed wilderness might harbor a creature known as a werewolf in the past, or as many call today, Dogman. He uses the terms interchangeably but indicated that the Dogman is thought by many to be an unidentified biological species of upright canines, as opposed to the shapeshifter aspect of werewolf lore. There are four typical characteristics of a Dogman-- an elongated snout, pointed ears, glowing eyes (sometimes independent of any light source), and bipedal locomotion-- walking on two legs. Very often, witnesses say the creature may start on two legs and then drop to four, or vice versa.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One of the witnesses at the Land Between the Lakes, teacher and researcher Mike Smith, told Deese about strange vocalizations and a footprint made into a cast that doesn't seem to match any known animals. One of the most striking recurring traits of people who have encounters with the Dogman is a kind of PTSD-- they have nightmares, insomnia, and are hesitant to go back in the woods, Deese detailed. &quot;And very often we're talking about law enforcement officers, military veterans, hunters, ranchers, farmers, people who are accustomed to being in dangerous situations...[and] accustomed to being around wildlife,&quot; he added. The sounds people have described of the creature are of an eerie half-human/half-canine growl. Further, there are stories of people being attacked or injured, but oddly, reports have either been kept quiet or have never been written down at all, Deese noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>KNAPP'S NEWS:\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>George shared recent items of interest, including articles on mysterious drones, and surprising facts about Memorial Day:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://bigthink.com/hard-science/3-body-problem-alien-communication\" target=\"_blank\">The case for stopping efforts to contact aliens\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://christopherkmellon.substack.com/p/who-is-operating-the-mystery-drones\" target=\"_blank\">Who Is Operating the Mystery Drones Plaguing the U.S. Military?\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://time.com/6982419/memorial-day-united-states-surprising-facts\" target=\"_blank\">10 Surprising Facts About Memorial Day\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-inside-story\" target=\"_blank\">Toxic Gaslighting: How 3M Executives Convinced a Scientist the Forever Chemicals She Found in Human Blood Were Safe\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/maya-cracked-mirror\" target=\"_blank\">For the Ancient Maya, Cracked Mirrors Were a Portal to the World Beyond\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.salon.com/2024/05/22/apocalypse-now-and-always-on-ufos-ai-and-encounters-with-non-human-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">Apocalypse now, and always: On UFOs, AI and encounters with non-human intelligence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/killer-whales-keep-attacking-sinking-090349442.html\" target=\"_blank\">Killer whales keep ramming and sinking boats.

He joined guest host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss a friend's contact experience, encountering an Ascended Master at Mount Shasta, and his father's connection to Roswell. Sinclair briefly explained that becoming a Grand Knight Commander involves progression through various levels of knighthood, beginning at an entry-level knight and advancing through merit and hard work. His role includes recruiting new dames and knights, promoting the order, and serving as a goodwill ambassador for the Royal House of Ghassan.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair described a mystical encounter with Archangel Michael during his spiritual journey. Through meditation, he experienced a dark entity that was warded off by a powerful angelic figure wielding a sword, whom he later identified as Archangel Michael. This experience reinforced his connection to the Archangel and influenced the naming of the order. Sinclair shared details of a paranormal encounter involving his friend in Washington, who captured an image of an extraterrestrial entity near her home (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/blake-sinclair-photos-52524/\" target=\"_self\">related photos\u003c/a>).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair shared messages from extraterrestrial beings, specifically from the Andromeda Council and Commander Ashtar, who emphasized the importance of reconnecting to the source, activating DNA codes, and raising planetary frequencies. The ETs expressed their intent to support humanity in reclaiming freedom and joining the Galactic Family of Light, adhering to universal laws like non-interference. He recounted a mystical encounter at Mount Shasta with Ascended Masters like the Maha Chohan, Saint Germain, and Jesus. This experience included auditory phenomena and a sudden change in weather, which he interpreted as divine signs.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair also discussed his late father's connection to the Roswell incident. According to Sinclair, his father, a top-secret photographer in the Army, developed photos of the Roswell crash and its beings. Sinclair later uncovered more about his father's involvement in photographing and potentially reverse engineering UFO technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the latter half of the program, Hospice nurse \u003ca href=\"https://www.hospicenursejulie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Julie McFadden\u003c/a> demystified the end-of-life journey and shared the otherworldly beauty of deathbed phenomena, as well as facts and myths about hospice care, the grieving process, and how to have a &quot;nothing to fear&quot; attitude about death.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She discussed her transition from being an ICU nurse to a Hospice nurse, highlighting the shift in perspective that motivated this change. In the ICU, the focus is on preserving life at all costs, often resulting in interventions that might be more harmful than beneficial. After nearly eight years in the ICU, McFadden became curious about the quality of life and death if aggressive treatments were not pursued. This curiosity led her to Hospice care, where the approach is to help patients live out their remaining time as peacefully as possible.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>McFadden addressed the challenge of caring for young patients in Hospice, acknowledging the heartbreak and difficulty involved. She emphasized that while it is undeniably tragic when young people die, the focus should be on helping them live and die with dignity and peace. Denial of death often leads to unnecessary suffering for both the patient and their families, she suggested. McFadden advocated for a more accepting and supportive approach that can result in some of the most profound and transformative experiences, even in the face of such immense sorrow.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>McFadden detailed the body's built-in mechanisms to ease the process of dying. For example, as death approaches, individuals naturally sleep more and eat and drink less, which helps the body shut down in a way that minimizes discomfort. McFadden highlighted that while the process can appear distressing, understanding the biological changes can provide comfort to families. She also addressed the phenomenon of the &quot;rally&quot; or terminal lucidity, where a dying person may suddenly become more alert and active before death, which can be a cherished moment for loved ones. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Beginning-Antidote-Civilization/dp/B0CXJKLNKG/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">A New Beginning: An Antidote to Civilization\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Fear-Demystifying-Death-Fully/dp/0593713249/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Nothing to Fear: Demystifying Death to Live More Fully \u003c/a>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Fear-Demystifying-Death-Fully/dp/0593713249/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Hardcover\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam ","title":"Wreckage","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVC4D83W/ctoc"},{"artist":"Mary Simon","title":"Heart Sing","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6LL5N6V/ctoc"},{"artist":"Them Dirty Roses","title":"Cocaine And Whiskey","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RBHNMJR/ctoc"},{"artist":"Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats","title":"Heartless","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYWLWYQD/ctoc"},{"artist":"Foo Fighters","title":"Home","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073MZDGC8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Mark Knopfler","title":"All Comers","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2Q5MJST/ctoc"},{"artist":"Slash","title":"Living For The City","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FM1VBK/ctoc"},{"artist":"Mildred Anderson ","title":"Hard Times","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWXJV2U/ctoc"},{"artist":"Yazoo","title":"Situation","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001249TQO/ctoc"},{"artist":"Crash Test Dummies","title":"Superman's Song","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007F5K9N6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Myles & Lenny","title":"Can You Give It All To Me","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjWR5UeaoQ8"},{"artist":"Derrick Dove","title":"When Did I Get Old","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHN4NSCN/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Trews","title":"Highway Of Heros","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R9N9PS4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000TERJ06/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F664fc7faa071be684fffec11","%2F664fc98b9325c6cf810c4a79"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/spiritual path","keywords/deathbed phenomena","keywords/attitudes about death"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6653113da52dcb9d0c999ca5","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 25 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6653114ea52dcb9d0c999ca6","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 25 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6653115ca52dcb9d0c999ca7","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 25 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6653116aa52dcb9d0c999ca8","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 25 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Silhouette of a woman walking into the light","id":"%2F664fe085cf2a8dd792e647f3","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/664fe085cf2a8dd792e647f3","source_credit":"baona / E+ / Getty Images","title":"Silhouette of a woman walking into the light","url":"asset://assets.getty/664fe085cf2a8dd792e647f3","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1716645600000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-05-25-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://sirblakesinclair.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blake Sinclair\u003c/a> discussed a contact experience, encountering an Ascended Master at Mount Shasta, and his father's connection to Roswell.

Author \u003ca href=\"http://www.ronfelber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Felber\u003c/a> joined \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss that topic, as presented in what some are calling the most frightening book about demonic possession since &quot;The Exorcist&quot;- his new novel &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unwelcomed-Curious-Case-Clara-Fowler/dp/168513419X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Unwelcomed\u003c/a>.&quot; Felber spoke about his research into demons and possession, and how his understanding of the phenomenon changed him; as well as how he came across the case of Clara Fowler, which inspired the book, directly from The Exorcist author William Peter Blatty. As Felber explained it, he first became associated with Blatty in the 1970s, while still a student and aspiring novelist. After striking up a friendship, he visited with Blatty in California, where Blatty told him about the case of Clara Fowler. While The Exorcist is based mostly on the accounts of an American boy given the pseudonym Roland Doe, who began experiencing symptoms of demonic possession after receiving a Ouija board from a spiritualist aunt, that wasn’t the only case Blatty researched. The turn-of-the-century Fowler case was another incident he stumbled upon during his research, and it was that case which would eventually inspire Felber’s new book. Felber explained that Blatty had tried to write about the Fowler case, “as a documentary… and found that it was dry and too much like a medical case history and a textbook. So, he decided to take the general concept of demonic possession and exorcism and novelize it.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The Fowler case came to light after American psychiatrist Dr. Morton Prince, who Felber described as “the father of abnormal psychology” was contacted by general physician Jackson Putnam, who wrote to Prince that if he were living in a different time he would attribute the case to demonic possession, while acknowledging that it was outside his area of expertise. The symptoms, which Prince and his team would eventually observe themselves, included changes in her looks, voice, and temperament. “The symptoms were incredible,” Felber noted. “Her face would remold into a different face. Her voice would change into this terrifying voice… in different languages.” And, she would react violently to religious objects. While Prince was looking for some diagnoses to explain these behaviors – such as schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, or something like a chemical imbalance or a brain lesion – other members of his team, according to Felber, were more open to more esoteric explanations. Those explanations began to gain plausibility for some of the team, Felber explained, when they considered the fact that Fowler had lost two young siblings under tragic and suspicious circumstances. There were also long allegations of Satanic cult activities in the region, some of which were later confirmed, Felber said. Whether abuse led to dissociation in Fowler, or her father’s alleged cult practices opened her up to demonic possession, however, remains the central question of the case. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, callers on the open lines shared their own stories and theories related to the Fowler story and demonic possession, as well as multiple UFO encounters and more. A pair of callers also shared their strange experiences since the Fermilab particle accelerator near Chicago went online. The first caller to mention Fermilab, Sean, noted that after an experiment in particle collision “two or three years ago” that he said, “detected a brand new form of matter,” which was then, “swept under the rug,” he began noticing strange occurrences around his home. “Ever since they did this experiment, I swear, it’s been like a hole has been ripped open or something. I’m only 80 miles or so from the lab and I’m talking about spirits, the lights forming into ethereal beings, and it just gets more and more intense as the time goes by.” Sean also mentioned UFO activity and entities that could be seen by anyone with the naked eye. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second caller to discuss the Fermilab installation, Chris from Milwaukee, said he was calling, “just to back up Sean, and say there’s been some weird stuff going on in the sort of general tri-state area” which he attributes to the activity there. That included increased UFO activity, and what he believes is interdimensional travel. “It’s Fermilab,” Chris said. “Honestly, I don’t know if it’s opened a portal, or it’s more sent out a signal… (that) put us on (the) radar” of the UFO pilots, whoever they are. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unwelcomed-Curious-Case-Clara-Fowler/dp/168513419X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Unwelcomed: The Curious Case of Clara Fowler\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Green Day","title":"Suzie Chapstick","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKMNW4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Dan Mangan","title":"Road Regrets","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y62GMY8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Black Keys","title":"On The Game","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQRYV8RB/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Jon","title":"Give Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZC8WRP2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Hootie & The Blowfish","title":"For What It's Worth","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3T3DG8X/ctoc"},{"artist":"Whiskey Myers","title":"Heart Of Stone","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QV7PF24/ctoc"},{"artist":"Los Lobos","title":"Wicked Rain","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0022F0HV8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Papa Roach","title":"Leave A Light On","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PV7YZVQ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bronski Beat","title":"Smalltown Boy","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Smalltown-Boy-94-Bronski-Beat/dp/B00004ZJ3R/ctoc"},{"artist":"Matt Mays","title":"Cocaine Cowgirl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LPBY7BL/ctoc"},{"artist":"Harlequin ","title":"Thinking Of You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003WBA4KU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Fontaines DC","title":"Starburster","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ4693WY/ctoc"},{"artist":"JJ Wilde","title":"Best Of Me","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1SLLND3/ctoc"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Gypsy-Honeymoon-Kim-Carnes/dp/B000TERJ06/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e018006537fd678a3ecf745","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/demonic possession"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6651c32305007c295f86458a","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 24 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6651c33205007c295f86458b","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 24 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6651c34105007c295f86458c","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 24 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6651c34c05007c295f86458d","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 24 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.coast2coast","caption":"","id":"%2Fe07ad7184465da5a5afb03a014053208","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.coast2coast/e07ad7184465da5a5afb03a014053208","source_credit":"","title":"Demonic Spirits/ Open Lines","url":"asset://assets.coast2coast/e07ad7184465da5a5afb03a014053208","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1716559200000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-05-24-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Author \u003ca href=\"http://www.ronfelber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Felber\u003c/a> joined \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss his new novel &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unwelcomed-Curious-Case-Clara-Fowler/dp/168513419X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Unwelcomed\u003c/a>.&quot;

Michael Waller\u003c/a>, Ph.D., is a senior analyst for strategy at the Center for Security Policy, worked for the CIA in Central America, did groundbreaking scholarship after the Soviet empire's breakup, and taught history and methods at America's premier intelligence schools. In the first half, he discussed the history and operation of the CIA, and some of the organization's failings and problems. He also shared his insights into Russia (having traveled there in the waning days of the Cold War) and his impressions of Vladimir Putin, who at the time of his visit was an official of the St. Petersburg city government.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In terms of evaluating the CIA's performance, they do a good job collecting intelligence on the terrorists abroad and on specific targets like the Iranian nuclear program, he said, but as far as analyzing political intelligence, he believes they have fallen short. For instance, the CIA's analysis on Russia's invasion of Ukraine was inaccurate, leading to a lack of strategy for the US government. They had predicted that the Russians would conquer all of Ukraine within three or four days. As Waller sees it, one of the core problems with the CIA is that it has mirrored the current polarization of culture in many ways. &quot;You've got a lot of disagreement within the agency and both supporters and critics of the agency,&quot; he remarked, adding that &quot;they need to just stick to the basic stuff, collecting intelligence abroad, analyzing it objectively, and providing it to decision makers.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The founder of Going with Grace, \u003ca href=\"https://goingwithgrace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alua Arthur\u003c/a> is the most visible and active death doula working in America today. In the latter half, she revealed why we need to change how we think about death and how it can help us lead more fulfilling and authentic lives. A death doula, she explained, supports dying people and their loved ones emotionally, spiritually, and practically. Dying, she pointed out, is a complex process, grappling with the ups and downs of illness and grief while preparing to leave behind everybody one has ever known and loved. &quot;I find that many people, as they get closer to the end of their lives, have to reconcile a life that they thought that they should have had or could have had with the one that they actually have. And my hope is, by default to think of our lives as we live them as absolutely perfect as they were,&quot; she commented.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Arthur emphasized the importance of preparing for end-of-life while one is still healthy, through advanced directives and open conversations about death, including medical power of attorney and life support desires (the organization \u003ca href=\"https://www.fivewishes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Five Wishes\u003c/a> offers an online advance directive). In the case of a terminal illness, the dying person may start to disengage from the world around them, and certain physical characteristics can be observed like skin mottling, and a sort of shrinking of the body, she detailed. While there could be an appeal to dying in your sleep, &quot;some people really want to live their death. They want to be present for it the entire time and see it going away with eyes open to whatever might be coming if there's anything,&quot; she added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Big-Intel-Heroes-State-Villains/dp/1684513537/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Big Intel: How the CIA and FBI Went from Cold War Heroes to Deep State Villains\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Briefly-Perfectly-Human-Authentic-Getting/dp/0063240033/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Briefly Perfectly Human: Making an Authentic Life by Getting Real About the End\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Johnny Desmond","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RBQYQT"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000062FZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Supertramp","title":"The Logical Song","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FWC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Remastered-Basswolf/dp/B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001OH7S/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002G3Y/ctoc"},{"artist":"Barbara Lewis","title":"Baby I’m Yours","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SZF42O/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Modern Crusaders","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000TDFKVW"},{"artist":"Skeeter Davis","title":"The End of the World","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002WS9/ctoc"},{"artist":"David Holmes","title":"Pickpockets","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RTFG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Don’t Fear the Reaper","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YTY8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Age of Loneliness","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Cross-Changes-Enigma/dp/B000002U6E/ctoc"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"Embraceable You","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Embraceable-You/dp/B001AW5KWA//ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6646a26158c649aca802e036","%2F6646a4098bc0e3a208e18f6e"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/CIA","keywords/death doula"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6650713dc4c61665f9cc8d7a","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 23 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6650714bc4c61665f9cc8d7b","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 23 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66507159c4c61665f9cc8d7c","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 23 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6650716fc4c61665f9cc8d7d","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 23 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Government Secrets and Classified Documents","id":"%2F6646bdbc66802035887d8360","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/6646bdbc66802035887d8360","source_credit":"Douglas Rissing / iStock / Getty Images","title":"Government Secrets and Classified Documents","url":"asset://assets.getty/6646bdbc66802035887d8360","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1716472800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-05-23-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Analyst \u003ca href=\"https://substack.com/@bigintel\" target=\"_blank\">J.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Olsen recounted his trip to Antarctica around five years ago and what he observed there. There is a no-fly zone over the South Pole, and he suggested this could be a cover-up for a giant hole in the ice, which Admiral Byrd allegedly reported as an aviator on his first flyover of the area. Major disclosures could come from Antarctica from any one of a number of discoveries waiting to be confirmed, he said, including possible pyramids in the Ellsworth Mountains, and in the Beardmore Glacier, where some have claimed that a huge black basalt UFO has partially emerged from the ice.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The \u003ca href=\"https://www.discovery.com/exploration/stone-jars-laos\" target=\"_blank\">stone jars\u003c/a> in Laos, estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,500 years old, are enormous in size, and legend has it that they were constructed by giants who used them for drinking cups. Near the jars, there are many burials of neatly stacked bones, so it's thought the locals used the jars for bodies to decompose and then pulled them out. Olsen also touched on the elongated skulls found in various parts of the world, with some contending they could have been part of an ancient alien race or civilization. The cultural practice of binding or putting a board on the head to change its shape would not account for how the skulls show evidence of having larger than normal brain sizes and eye sockets, he pointed out, adding that &quot;maybe they were the offspring of the Anunnaki, or the Nephilim.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Researcher of ancient cultures, religion, and physics, \u003ca href=\"https://sonic-geometry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Rankin\u003c/a> is most recognized for his discovery that elemental geometric shapes reveal specific musical harmonics. In the latter half, he showed how the ancient alien theory is backed up by geometry and harmonics. &quot;Physicists now believe that there is a geometric substrate behind all of what we call reality...And if the universe is geometric in nature, and geometry reveals harmonics, then now we're talking about the entire structure of the universe as being one giant harmonic system,&quot; he marveled. There is evidence that ancient structures like the Great Pyramids are embedded with mathematical and geometrical information about the planet, he said, and this can first be traced back to around 6,000 years ago, when extraterrestrial beings or the Anunnaki visited Earth and shared advanced technology with a small group of people in Sumeria.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rankin set the date of interaction at 6,000 years ago as that was the time writing was first developed, and before that time would be conjecture. What was being conveyed was not mythology, lore, or religion, he continued. It was facts about our planet, sun, moon, and solar system that could not otherwise have been known at the time. One extrapolation from this is that we could be living in an &quot;engineered local reality&quot; – a kind of hologram supported by a geometric matrix holding information. He also touched on sound technology, his interest in the \u003ca

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.
