News at 5:30, 6:00, and 11:00, and working on special projects.\n\nDave also feels privileged that his job allows him the opportunity to help with organizations like the Children's Miracle Network which raises money locally for Maynard Children's Hospital, Eastern Carolina Vocational Center which highlights the abilities of those with disabilities, and with the Marine Corps Reserves Toys for Tots as they help to brighten the Christmas season for kids and families in need across Eastern Carolina.\n\nDave has covered many big stories over the years, including the devastation from Hurricane Floyd across eastern Carolina back in 1999, a confession from a convicted murderer serving a life sentence that led to a guilty verdict in another murder case, and closure for a family, as well as numerous campaign stops from presidential candidates, including an interview with President Donald Trump in 2019.\n\nHis reporting has been recognized with numerous awards by both the North Carolina Associated Press and the Radio Television Digital News Association of the Carolinas.\n\nDave grew up in Pennsylvania and graduated from Sheffield area Junior/Senior High School and Clarion University

in Beaufort County, or any of our wonderful beaches.  \n\nDave lives in Washington, NC and has two adult children, David and Grace.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-09-01T15:27:15.529Z","custom_gray_stationname":"witn","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:53:11.134Z","description":{"basic":"Reaction

He then went on to complete his time at Martinsville High School and pursued his education at Radford University, while working remotely with BTW21 for five and half years. \n \nDuring his time in college, Staples decided to remain busy with his five years in Highlander Student Media as the Station Manager and weekly show host for Radio Free Radford, Weekly Weather Correspondent and co-Editor-in-Chief for the student newspaper, The Tartan, and Weather Correspondent for Radford on Camera. (ROC-TV). He then later was involved with a campus ministry, the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM) as a member, served on staff as the Social Media & Co-Outreach Coordinator, and finally became an intern the spring 2023. \nThroughout his time at Radford, a close friend of his gave him the title, \"Mr. Radford,\" as his involvement on-campus was very noticeable and still to this day, he is known as \"Mr. Radford\" or \"Mr. Weatherman when he makes trips back to his alma mater.\n \nWhen Staples is not busy on the air, you can find him exploring parts of ENC walking at the Greenway, taking pictures and videos of all weather, enjoying a hike in great outdoors, and traveling to the beach or mountains.\n\nIf you have a suggested restaurant or favorite attraction for Dustin to visit, you can send him an email or message him on his social media pages.","slug":"","instagram":"StaplesWeather","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"5","custom_gray_stationname":"witn","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-02-21T22:37:51.147Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T17:45:37.814Z","description":{"basic":"Lower

News at 5:30, 6:00, and 11:00, and working on special projects.\n\nDave also feels privileged that his job allows him the opportunity to help with organizations like the Children's Miracle Network which raises money locally for Maynard Children's Hospital, Eastern Carolina Vocational Center which highlights the abilities of those with disabilities, and with the Marine Corps Reserves Toys for Tots as they help to brighten the Christmas season for kids and families in need across Eastern Carolina.\n\nDave has covered many big stories over the years, including the devastation from Hurricane Floyd across eastern Carolina back in 1999, a confession from a convicted murderer serving a life sentence that led to a guilty verdict in another murder case, and closure for a family, as well as numerous campaign stops from presidential candidates, including an interview with President Donald Trump in 2019.\n\nHis reporting has been recognized with numerous awards by both the North Carolina Associated Press and the Radio Television Digital News Association of the Carolinas.\n\nDave grew up in Pennsylvania and graduated from Sheffield area Junior/Senior High School and Clarion University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen he's not working you might find Dave on his treadmill, working outside in the yard, enjoying the pool, hanging out with his Border Collie Max, exploring Goose Creek State Park in Beaufort County, or any of our wonderful beaches.  \n\nDave lives in Washington, NC and has two adult children, David and Grace.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-09-01T15:27:15.529Z","custom_gray_stationname":"witn","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:33:21.478Z","description":{"basic":"It

Growing up in Poughkeepsie, New York allowed Jim many opportunities to bug his family about the snow. Now, living in North Carolina allows him to bug them about hurricanes as well!\n\nJim’s road to Eastern Carolina went from a childhood in upstate New York to his adolescence in South Florida. Looking out the airplane window his first time flying into West Palm Beach, Jim turned to his mom and said “look, there’s snow on the ground!” Jim says she gave him a funny smile. The smile turned into a frown when they stepped off the plane and Jim realized that the “snow” was sand, and the air felt like a furnace! This is just one of many experiences that fueled Jim’s desire to learn more about the earth’s atmosphere.\n\nJim’s passion for weather took him to Florida State University, where he received a Bachelor’s degree in Meteorology. Within a week, he secured his first job, as the morning meteorologist for a Panama City, Florida television station. Although he was very excited about his first job, he quickly discovered one big problem. He would have to readjust his alarm clock from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. Strong coffee and cold showers became a regular part of his morning!\n\nJim says he was a fully transformed “morning person” when offered the opportunity to work as the meteorologist on WITN-7 News at Sunrise in 2001. With family in both New York and Florida, Eastern Carolina has proved to be the perfect location for Jim. He says being a part of WITN-7 News at Sunrise has been rewarding beyond his expectations. The people of Eastern Carolina are as kind and generous as any he’s ever met, and the variety of weather keeps him on his toes!
