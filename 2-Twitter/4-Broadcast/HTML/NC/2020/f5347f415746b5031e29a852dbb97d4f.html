She is a proud alum of the University of Missouri, where she graduated with a bachelor’s in journalism and political science and a minor in psychology. All four years of school, Delaney worked at Columbia’s local NBC affiliate KOMU 8 News and spent her last few years there as a reporter, producer and weekend anchor. Delaney also had a few internships during college including working locally for the Tom Bradley Radio Show on Jack.fm and working on the east coast at NBC Boston. She also studied abroad in Brussels, Belgium (a place she desperately wants to get back to!) where she worked as a video intern at Are We Europe magazine.\n\nDelaney enjoys telling many types of stories. Some of her past favorites include the continued coverage of Missouri’s legalization of recreational marijuana, including an exclusive interview she conducted with the first person to be released from prison because of the legalization. She also covered stories from Missouri’s capital about bills limiting transgender rights and how they impacted Missouri’s LGBTQ+ community. Internationally, she was in Belgium at the start of the war in Ukraine and was able to write a timeline of its first few months for Are We Europe magazine.\n\nMinus the brief internships in Boston and Belgium, Delaney has been a Midwest girl all her life. She’s excited to be in Wilmington where she can experience coastal living for an extended period of time, for the first time! When she’s not working, you can find her trying new restaurants, picking out her next read at the library and trying to soak up life by the water in the great city she now gets to call home.\n\nHave a story idea?

My first television job was in Rapid City, SD where I honed my winter weather forecasting skills. I also had the chance to be a Chief Meteorologist at a small station in Abilene, TX, right in the heart of tornado alley. Prior to my arrival at WECT, I picked up valuable tropical weather skills forecasting in the Lafayette, LA market along the U.S. Gulf coast.\n\nI am a native North Carolinian who is happy to be in the Tar Heel state. I was born in Raleigh and I am a graduate of Broughton High School and N. C. State's Meteorology program. The Raleigh Tornado of 1988 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 fueled my interest in weather when I was young. I was awarded the AMS Television Seal of Approval in 1998.\n\nI have been married for eighteen years to my wonderful wife Elizabeth. We have a son named Winston and a daughter named Anna-Scott. We also have a dachshund mixed dog named Texas (You can probably guess where we got him). I love sports such as: golf, basketball, and tennis. I'm also a big fan of John Grisham books. I am very happy to be in North Carolina to cheer my beloved N. C. State Wolfpack through thick and mostly thin.\n\nFor several years I served on the board of the Phoenix Employment Ministry. This group does wonderful work in helping homeless and nearly homeless people in our community find work. Over the years I have had the chance to share my passion for weather with many schools and civic organizations across southeast North Carolina.

The Hoggard High School Senior Class President started working for WECT as a teenager. <br/><br/>Colin began his television career here in the Production Department as a teleprompter operator, studio camera operator, designing graphics, audio operator, and assistant director. Finally, after a year of \"relentless begging,\" Colin changed his focus to news photographer. Colin fell in love with capturing a story on video, but it was during this time that he also developed a passion for telling the story, and a passion for covering weather as Hurricanes Fran, Bertha and Bonnie during the late 90's proved the importance of accurate weather reporting. Life, however, pulled Colin away from broadcast news for a few years. Upon his return in 2004, the folks at WECT gave him the opportunity to once again follow his passion. \"Once I returned, it was amazing what we could accomplish together. WECT is the place I learned how to live life. I had successes and failures, and through it all a few people stuck by my side and helped me to be the person I am today. I thank God for them,\" says Hackman. In March 2005, Colin moved to Reno/Lake Tahoe as a reporter for the NBC affiliate. In his first year he was promoted to weather anchor. It was also during this time that he met his wife, then executive producer, Michelle. \"She made me wait one year for a date, and then she told me you get one shot. I guess it went well,\" said Hackman. In December 2008, Colin with Michelle in tow, returned the Port City where his parents still live. Serving as morning meteorologist you can watch Colin on WECT and WSFX both anchoring weather and reporting for the area's most watched morning show. <em>Fun Facts:</em> <em>Colin's daughter, Peyton Frances, is named after WECT Anchor Frances Weller – and his childhood friend Peyton Dergay.<br/><br/>In 1995 Colin won the Mid-Eastern conference in the 1600m for Hoggard High School.  The same year he helped the Vikings win the east region in cross country.  Now he coaches track and cross country for Cape Fear Academy;  He still runs regularly.<br/><br/>Colin's mother is an accomplished actress and playwright.</em> <strong>Email: </strong><a href=\"mailto:chackman@wect.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to email Colin\">chackman@wect.com</a><br/> <a

N.C. (WECT) - Dry air will set meager rain chances across your First Alert Forecast for several days, and you may enjoy unseasonably low humidity into the weekend. Daytime high temperatures of lower and middle 80s are likely; nighttime readings will settle into the 60s and some mainland portions of the Cape Fear Region ought to ping the 50s. Area beaches will maintain a low to moderate rip current risk amid the 75-degree surf; remember to apply sunscreen generously! Make your weekend outdoor plans now."},{"type":"oembed_response","subtype":"twitter","_id":"LNGGUMM37JFBFF2LIH3KLULVSE","raw_oembed":{"url":"https://twitter.com/ericdavisWECT/status/1796337324290105426","author_name":"Eric R.

My first television job was in Rapid City, SD where I honed my winter weather forecasting skills. I also had the chance to be a Chief Meteorologist at a small station in Abilene, TX, right in the heart of tornado alley. Prior to my arrival at WECT, I picked up valuable tropical weather skills forecasting in the Lafayette, LA market along the U.S. Gulf coast.\n\nI am a native North Carolinian who is happy to be in the Tar Heel state. I was born in Raleigh and I am a graduate of Broughton High School and N. C. State's Meteorology program. The Raleigh Tornado of 1988 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 fueled my interest in weather when I was young. I was awarded the AMS Television Seal of Approval in 1998.\n\nI have been married for eighteen years to my wonderful wife Elizabeth. We have a son named Winston and a daughter named Anna-Scott. We also have a dachshund mixed dog named Texas (You can probably guess where we got him). I love sports such as: golf, basketball, and tennis. I'm also a big fan of John Grisham books. I am very happy to be in North Carolina to cheer my beloved N. C. State Wolfpack through thick and mostly thin.\n\nFor several years I served on the board of the Phoenix Employment Ministry. This group does wonderful work in helping homeless and nearly homeless people in our community find work. Over the years I have had the chance to share my passion for weather with many schools and civic organizations across southeast North Carolina.
