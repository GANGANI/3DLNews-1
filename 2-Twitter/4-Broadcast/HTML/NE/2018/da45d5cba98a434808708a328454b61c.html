","longBio":"I'm Kate K, a Digital Content Producer and Digital Reporter for KWQC TV6 News. Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Before that, he spent 13 years here at KWQC. \nErik studied Meteorology and Broadcasting at Arizona State University and is a proud Sun Devil. Outside of his first year forecasting in the desert at KPNX in Phoenix, Erik has had a Midwestern career with stops in Traverse City, Michigan and Mason City, Iowa before heading to the Quad Cities. Growing up in Minnesota Erik is a HUGE hockey fan and loves to follow the Storm. In the warmer months you’ll find him at as many River Bandits or Lumber Kings games as he can fit in. Erik’s hobbies include woodworking, soap making and cooking. Outdoors He enjoys golfing and Nordic walking. He LOVES kayaking and is a certified kayaking instructor. While he enjoys setting sail on our local lakes and rivers you’re more likely to find him paddling on Lake Michigan or Lake Superior! He also is a certified SCUBA diver and is continuing his pursuit of more professional dive certifications. Erik has 3 Quad Cities Marathons under his belt and numerous Bix 7s.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

","longBio":"I'm Kate K, a Digital Content Producer and Digital Reporter for KWQC TV6 News. Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Before that, he spent 13 years here at KWQC. \nErik studied Meteorology and Broadcasting at Arizona State University and is a proud Sun Devil. Outside of his first year forecasting in the desert at KPNX in Phoenix, Erik has had a Midwestern career with stops in Traverse City, Michigan and Mason City, Iowa before heading to the Quad Cities. Growing up in Minnesota Erik is a HUGE hockey fan and loves to follow the Storm. In the warmer months you’ll find him at as many River Bandits or Lumber Kings games as he can fit in. Erik’s hobbies include woodworking, soap making and cooking. Outdoors He enjoys golfing and Nordic walking. He LOVES kayaking and is a certified kayaking instructor. While he enjoys setting sail on our local lakes and rivers you’re more likely to find him paddling on Lake Michigan or Lake Superior! He also is a certified SCUBA diver and is continuing his pursuit of more professional dive certifications. Erik has 3 Quad Cities Marathons under his belt and numerous Bix 7s. Other outdoor endeavors include doing anything from flying kites to road-tripping. Don’t be surprised if Erik drives in to your town on any given weekend in his pride and joy: a red 1987 Porsche 924S He calls “The Chili Pepper”.\nErik enjoys speaking to school kids about weather and entertaining community groups with talks about weather, television, and his favorite subject: Erik Maitland!

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

","longBio":"I'm Kate K, a Digital Content Producer and Digital Reporter for KWQC TV6 News. Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.
