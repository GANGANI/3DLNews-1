","longBio":"Jan moved back to Iowa to join the KCRG-TV9 First Alert Storm Team during (yes, during!!) the August 2020 derecho. It was a whirlwind of a first few days, but Iowa's crazy weather is exactly why Jan wanted to be a meteorologist. Growing up in north-central Iowa, Jan fell in love with the dramatic and ever-changing weather at a young age and loves that her job keeps her on her toes as it is never the same.\n\nJan earned her Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from Iowa State University in 2017. While at Iowa State, she was an active member of the American Meteorological Society ISU student chapter and the Central Iowa National Weather Association chapter. She was also active in the school's weather broadcast, Cy's Eyes on the Skies, which she was a director and producer for. After graduating from college, she started her first job just 2 days later in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she worked for Gray TV’s network of stations across the state for 3 years including KOLN, KSNB, KNOP, and KNEP. \n\nIn 2021, Jan earned the American Meteorological Society's Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation. This designation is granted to meteorologists who meet established criteria for scientific competence and effective communication skills in their weather presentations. CBM recipients must hold a degree in meteorology, pass a rigorous written examination, and have their on-air work reviewed to assess graphical content, explanation, and presentation skills.  \n\nJan loves helping educate people on the weather happening around them. The favorite part of her job is going to schools and getting out in the community to share her love of science and weather with future scientists. She is a proud advocate of women in STEM and encouraging young ladies to pursue their science dreams. \n\nOutside of work, you’ll often find Jan and her husband, Drew, at local or state parks spending time enjoying the outdoors. They are avid travelers and love planning international trips together as well as smaller trips around the US. Back home Jan enjoys baking, playing board games, and snuggling her two black cats, Wally and Max.

Some of you may have seen me around the QCA covering news stories for KWQC's social media and other online platforms. Maybe even some of you have seen me pop up on an Instagram Reel or Story as well. I haven't made an on-air debut, but if you want to put a face to the name on some of the web and social content you're reading, I'm your gal. \n\nNow, here's a little bit of background about me- I'm a Quad Cities native, through and through, so I'm so happy to be able to tell the stories of our community and its members. I'm originally from Port Byron and went to Riverdale School District #100 from kindergarten to senior year, graduation. I've always been passionate about writing, so finding this career field has been a great fit. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Illinois State University (Go Red Birds!) in Public Relations, inside the School of Communications. I have prior experience working inside of an advertising agency managing multiple social media accounts and PR matters. \n\nSome fun facts about me are that I am a dog mom to Bashful, a 1-year-old Cockapoo, and a sister to Benny, he's a Goldendoodle and Baxter, a Standard Poodle- we love going to the dog park and getting pup cups. I do CrossFit in my free time and and I love anything with live music, but especially country music. \n\n I look forward to telling the stories of the QCA and surrounding areas during my time at TV6.

","longBio":"Jan moved back to Iowa to join the KCRG-TV9 First Alert Storm Team during (yes, during!!) the August 2020 derecho. It was a whirlwind of a first few days, but Iowa's crazy weather is exactly why Jan wanted to be a meteorologist. Growing up in north-central Iowa, Jan fell in love with the dramatic and ever-changing weather at a young age and loves that her job keeps her on her toes as it is never the same.\n\nJan earned her Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from Iowa State University in 2017. While at Iowa State, she was an active member of the American Meteorological Society ISU student chapter and the Central Iowa National Weather Association chapter. She was also active in the school's weather broadcast, Cy's Eyes on the Skies, which she was a director and producer for. After graduating from college, she started her first job just 2 days later in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she worked for Gray TV’s network of stations across the state for 3 years including KOLN, KSNB, KNOP, and KNEP. \n\nIn 2021, Jan earned the American Meteorological Society's Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation. This designation is granted to meteorologists who meet established criteria for scientific competence and effective communication skills in their weather presentations. CBM recipients must hold a degree in meteorology, pass a rigorous written examination, and have their on-air work reviewed to assess graphical content, explanation, and presentation skills.  \n\nJan loves helping educate people on the weather happening around them. The favorite part of her job is going to schools and getting out in the community to share her love of science and weather with future scientists. She is a proud advocate of women in STEM and encouraging young ladies to pursue their science dreams. \n\nOutside of work, you’ll often find Jan and her husband, Drew, at local or state parks spending time enjoying the outdoors. They are avid travelers and love planning international trips together as well as smaller trips around the US. Back home Jan enjoys baking, playing board games, and snuggling her two black cats, Wally and Max.
