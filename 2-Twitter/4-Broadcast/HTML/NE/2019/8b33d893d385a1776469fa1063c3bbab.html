You can now see his weather forecasts weekdays on First at Four and Fridays at 5, 6 and 10pm. He earned his American Meteorological Society Certified Broadcast Meteorologist seal in 2008.\n\nFrom an early age, Brandon has been fascinated with weather. After receiving his meteorology degree at North Carolina State, Brandon began his broadcast meteorology career at KRBC in Abilene, Texas in 2003. He started as the weekend meteorologist. During his time there he was promoted to morning meteorologist and eventually chief meteorologist before moving to Lincoln. While there have been numerous forecasts, severe weather events and winter weather events in his career so far, the most memorable was the tornado in Southwest Lincoln in 2019. \n\nWhen not working on or delivering a weather forecast, you can usually find Brandon watching a movie, at a rock concert or hanging out with friends. He also enjoys watching and going to see several sports including basketball, football, baseball, hockey and auto racing.

Koeller is a meteorologist for 6 News WOWT, bringing you weather updates in several afternoon and evening newscasts as well as any time severe weather threatens.\n\nWeather has been David's passion from age 5 when he witnessed a tornado touch down not far from his home in Colorado Springs. Since then, he has been fascinated with forecasting, weather patterns, extreme weather and understanding why it all happens.\n\nDavid didn't always want to be on TV. As a high school student, he wanted to work for the National Weather Service. In college, he realized he liked to talk about the weather too much, and the best way to use that was to move on to TV. He said he never gets tired of people asking about the forecast.\n\nAfter living in Colorado, David grew up in Kansas City, Kansas and graduated from Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. He attended St. Louis University beginning in 2008 where he ran the student television station and served as their meteorologist. While at SLU, David interned at Fox 2 and then KMBC 9 in Kansas City. He graduated in May of 2012 and moved to Springfield, Missouri a few months later to serve as the Chief Meteorologist for FOX 5 until September of 2018.\n\nIn his spare time, David enjoys biking and running, spending time outdoors and swimming as well as some occasionally binge watching Netflix or Amazon.\n\nDavid said the weather in Omaha has already proven to be very exciting, and he is looking forward to bringing the forecast to everyone in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wowt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-08-09T20:05:59.300Z","type":"author","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T01:32:08.418Z","description":{"basic":"After

Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at jacob.lawson@1011now.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"27","custom_gray_stationname":"koln","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-11T16:29:48.546Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:44:56.912Z","description":{"basic":"A child from Hickman had to be life-flighted to Omaha after a crash just east of Eagle."},"headlines":{"basic":"Hickman girl life-flighted after two-vehicle crash east of Eagle","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":["car crash","car accident"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"car crash generic.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","owner":"kali.orourke@gray.tv","proxyUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/rizv-ulqnZRoLIs8ozaOlu6t-a4=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","usage_instructions":"Cleared for use","version":0,"template_id":35},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"c064a8c7e60b1f5f19091343361201387d098f269c9b22230024493fed1e0c4f"},"caption":"A child from Hickman had to be life-flighted to Omaha after a crash just east of Eagle.","copyright":"Copyright 2023 MGN.

Nebraska for nearly three decades. Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at

The horse, called No. 415, was born and bred at the famous Pitzer Ranch in Ericson and is a once-in-a-lifetime performance horse. He was purchased as a weanling by Mark Wray and then trained by the Wray family. Troy loved the idea and while they couldn’t specifically write that into the contract, the retention bonus will be used for No. 415.

NE","description":"FFWGID  The National Weather Service in Hastings has extended the  * Flash Flood Warning for... Western Howard County in central Nebraska... East Central Sherman County in central Nebraska...  * Until 145 PM CDT.  * At 1117 AM CDT, Doppler radar indicated that heavy rain from earlier this morning had long since moved out of the area. However, flash flooding continues in the area as a result of 2 to 5 inches that earlier fell. Law enforcement and emergency management reported that numerous rural roads have been closed, and reports and photos from the public and spotters confirm that several small creeks remain flooded. This includes an automated gauge along the Turkey Creek north of Dannebrog, which has rapidly risen to 17.5 feet, slightly above the 17.0 foot flood state. Although spotty showers and thunderstorms could move back into the area into early this afternoon, fortunately any threat for potentially concentrated heavy rain should hold off until late this afternoon or this evening, if it even occurs again in the Warning area at all during the next 24 hours.  HAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.  SOURCE...Law enforcement and emergence management reported.  IMPACT...Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.  * Some locations that could experience flash flooding include... St. Paul, Elba, Ashton and Farwell.  This includes the following streams and drainages... Munson Creek, Cedar Creek, Turkey Creek, Cow Creek, Auger Creek, Cady Creek, Oak Creek and Davis Creek.","type":"warning"}]},"watch":{},"other":{},"count":1,"_id":"78b2784a89d0c339fb843262dd18f124380b9a955ad1d17f21d136ac436fcb4f"},"expires":1717093828188,"lastModified":1717093665000}},"gsync-closings":{"{}":{"data":{"exportType":"L1","lastUpdated":"2024-05-30T18:28:35.431Z","countiesList":[],"states":[],"statesSelectKeyValuePairs":[],"organizations":[],"totalResults":0,"typesSelectKeyValuePairs":[],"dataTransformedAt":"2024-05-30T18:28:35.431Z","_id":"f511e23b5856d11a3dbd14c3c3aa86821e0f2f6c48687e22b53e9497a5b583f8"},"expires":1717093835431,"lastModified":1717093715398}},"gsync-elections-featured":{"{\"arc-site\":\"koln\",\"includeTestResults\":false}":{"data":{"id":null,"isActive":false,"name":"","races":[{"candidates":[{"id":"51566","order":"1","entryType":"1","isIncumbent":true,"isWatched":true,"isWinner":true,"name":"Pete
