(WTAP) - As we start to get ready to wrap up the week, you are going to notice a chill in the air this morning across the Mid-Ohio Valley. Temperatures across the region will be in the low 40s this morning, a few spots have been even dropping into the upper 30s. This is weather we usually see in early spring. So, with today being the last day of May, we are going to need to bring out the jackets one more time. Luckily, with more widespread sunshine today, we are going to get a decent warm up this afternoon. Daytime highs will be in the mid-70s, which is close to our upper 70s average for this time of year.

<a href=\"http://w.va/\" target=\"_blank\">W.Va</a>. (WTAP) - It is going to be a quiet end to the week across the Mid-Ohio Valley. The showers and thunderstorms we had on Wednesday is all gone. However, as we look ahead at sunny skies, we will have to deal with some cooler temperatures. That will not be a problem in the afternoon, only during the overnight hours and the start of our day. It will feel quite chilly as we get ready for the morning commute today. Temperatures across the region are starting off in the upper 40s to low 50s. This is thanks to radiative cooling that took place last night with the combination of clear skies and calm winds. As we enjoy ample sunshine this afternoon, it will help to bring our temperatures up. Even though highs will be below average, we will see the low 70s this afternoon. Winds will be on the light side today with a northerly wind of around 5 to 10 mph."},{"_id":"MS4RZ644RVBVLJIZLTWRVF62YM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717065420264,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Clear skies will be around heading into tonight and plummet our temperatures down into the lower 40s.

On average, for the end of May, our overnight lows sit around the mid-50s. In fact, we could potentially get close to the daily record low temperature. If we hit 38 degrees Friday morning, we will tie the daily record low for May 31st.

The reason why the start of the weekend should be a time to get outside is because the chance of rain will be around on Sunday.

","longBio":"Phyllis Smith started working at WTAP on July 6, 2015. She grew up in Vienna and graduated from Parkersburg High School. She graduated from West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in Communication Studies and a minor in English. While she was at Wesleyan, she interned at WDTV in Bridgeport. She was hired as a weekend reporter while she was still in college. Phyllis learned the ropes at WDTV and met some of her closest friends there. \n\nSome of the biggest stories she covered at WDTV included a train derailment in Randolph County, the Elk River water crisis in Kanawha County, and when a man shot and killed four people in a drug deal gone wrong in Clarksburg. Two of the people shot and killed were a father and son that were delivering newspapers early in the morning who were innocent bystanders. One of the most intense stories she covered at WTAP was the IEI warehouse fire in 2017. Thirty-nine fire departments worked for over a week to put out the fire, and it could be seen for miles.\n\nDuring her time at WTAP, Phyllis has won four Ohio Associated Press awards, one West Virginia Broadcasters Association Excellence in Broadcasting award and one Virginias Associated Press award. \n\nIt was always Phyllis' hope she could come back home and work at WTAP.
