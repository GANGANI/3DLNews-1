He is excited for the forecasting challenges Appalachia brings to the table!","longBio":"Nicholas is the weekday noon, and 4 p.m. Meteorologist at WSAZ. He is no stranger to the tri-state area, as he spent 4 years (from 2017 to 2021) attaining his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology at Ohio University in Athens. Here, he was able to become the lead forecaster at WOUB, southeastern Ohio’s PBS station and Ohio University’s student-run television station. He was also an event coordinator for the University’s chapter of the American Meteorological Society, and served as the Lead Forecaster for the student-run forecast Laboratory, the Scalia Lab.\n\nPrior to returning to the area, Nicholas spent the last two years in Twin Falls, ID, working at our sister station, KMVT. Here, he served as the Morning Meteorologist from January 2023-June 2023, and the Weekend Meteorologist/MMJ from June 2021-January 2023. During his time in the Gem State, he won multiple awards for his weathercasts (including the 2022 best weathercast award from the Idaho Press Club), and his reporting.\n\nNicholas grew up on the west side of Cleveland, and has been a weather geek for virtually his entire life. Two main events fueled his passion – the Valentine’s Day winter storm of 2007, and a severe rotating thunderstorm impacting the Lake Erie shore on May 7, 2010. His main passions in the field are winter storms and severe thunderstorms.\n\nWhile in college, Nicholas was able to take part in a storm chasing seminar in 2019, and a small research project focusing on thunderstorm initiation along dry lines in the Great Plains in 2020; both experiences under the advising of tornado and radar scientist Dr. Jana Houser.\n\nWhile not on the air or forecasting, Nicholas enjoys hiking, biking, golfing, and skiing. He is also a HUGE Cavs, Guardians, and Browns fan, so don’t be surprised to see him disappointed while out and about on any given Sunday afternoon in the fall. He is also a member of the American Meteorological Society, from which he holds the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation. You can follow him on Twitter and Instagram: @snider_wx, or on Facebook: Meteorologist Nicholas

Ariana is originally from Huntington, New York and is thrilled to now be working out of Huntington, West Virginia. \n\nAriana graduated with a dual degree in International Relations and Broadcast and Digital Journalism. She also minored in Anthropology and graduated with Cum Laude. \n\nAs a college student, Ariana has interned for a West Virginia station, but this is her first time reporting in the state. She was stationed in D.C. as a bureau reporter for WBOY in the summer of 2022. It was here she found her passion for policy stories and impact journalism. Before that she was a reporter for a newspaper in London, England as part of her study abroad in the summer of 2021. Throughout her time at college, she was also involved in different campus broadcasting shows for a completely student run station, CitrusTV.\n\nOutside of working as a reporter, you will often find Ariana hiking.

Meanwhile, a small area of low pressure to our north will extend an arcing line of scattered showers at us, the leading edge of a colder push of air aloft. As this works southward, our area locally will de-stabilize, allowing for patchy rain and some rumbles to develop as the moisture swings south then east. The farther south you are, the longer you’ll get to enjoy this first phase of comfortable weather before going through the temporary disruption of the passing showers and storms. Highs today will ultimately stay in the 70s, cooling down to the 40s and 50s as the rain ends and the skies clear.

He has been forecasting here since 2011.","longBio":"Meteorologist Brandon Butcher is the morning meteorologist at WSAZ. He has been forecasting here since 2011, but Brandon has called the Mountain State home before. Starting in 2000, he worked as Chief Meteorologist at WDTV in Clarksburg, WV. After several years there, he then went to his home state of Massachusetts to work in Springfield; but it wouldn't be long before those 'Country Roads' came calling again.\n\nBrandon earned his degree in meteorology from Penn State University (so he likes to think he can stay out of the Marshall/WVU fray). He is a member of the National Weather Association and the American Meteorological Society, where he holds both their respective \"Seals of Approval\".\n\nBrandon is a multi-EMMY award-winning meteorologist, including winning back-to-back-to-back EMMYs for outstanding weathercasting in the Boston/New England Region. He also won an EMMY in West Virginia for a special program on the great West Virginia floods of 1985. Brandon earned the award of \"Best Weathercaster\" in the state of West Virginia in 2005, from the State Broadcasters Association.\n\nSevere and unusual weather is a passion of Brandon's, having ventured out into 6 hurricanes, and broadcast live during a tornado event as the twister was hitting his studio building. Teaching is also one of Brandon's pursuits, as he is earning his Masters Degree in Education and currently teaches meteorology at the collegiate level inside and outside the state.\n\nBrandon is excited to be with the morning show crew at NewsChannel 3, and enjoys hearing from viewers whenever and wherever possible. Whether it's an email, Facebook post, or tweet, he's always glad to interact. Maybe it will even happen on the air. When not forecasting and having fun on the morning show, Brandon likes to enjoy the great outdoors and being with his kids. He could also be seen at the gym, at church, or perhaps an event you have going on in your community! From Hillbilly Days to the Jackson Apple Festival, the Flatwoods Outlets straight down US-19 to the Gorge, and everywhere in between, he certainly likes taking in the sights and sounds. He also likes to play and collect boardgames-- he has hundreds of them. He is willing to share anything besides popcorn-- as his wife can attest.\n\nBrandon is married and has 4 children, (2 daughters and 2 sons). In order from eldest to youngest, they are Cady, Anna, Gavin, and Landon.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsaz","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2022-06-03T19:21:38.156Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"8"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T13:37:44.178Z","description":{"basic":"Partly
