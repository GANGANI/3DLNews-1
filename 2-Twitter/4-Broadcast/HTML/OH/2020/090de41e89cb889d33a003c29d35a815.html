Fearing my parents would be deported, as a child, I turned to news broadcasting to keep me updated on the immigration and deportation climate. It was then that I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up: a reporter.\nYears later, I am fulfilling that dream.\nPrior to joining the FOX19 NOW team, I worked as a multimedia journalist for CAN-TV Chicago. My work primarily focused on covering underserved communities in the city’s south side. Because of this work, I was given the opportunity to act as a national correspondent and travel to the border city of El Paso, Texas to cover the migrant crisis following the expiration of Title 42.\nIn addition to that work, I also produced two short-form documentaries. My first documentary titled, “The Perilous Journey To The American Dream” was published by the Illinois Latino News Network and later played in a Chicago theater. My second documentary titled, “Somos Venezolanos” was part of a collaboration, and was produced in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This documentary focused primarily on immigration within Latin American countries.\nWhen I am not watching or covering the news you can find me at a thrift store hunting for that one-of-a-kind find or at home doing a puzzle.\nI am very excited to begin my on-air reporting career in the Cincinnati/Tri-State area and look forward to using my skills and experience to share impactful stories from those in this community.\nIf you have a story idea, feel free to send me an email at brenda.ordonez@fox19now.com or reach me on social media.\nSi tiene una idea para una historia, no dude en enviarme un correo electrónico a brenda.ordonez@fox19now.com o a mis medios de comunicacion

After spending the last seven years behind the anchor desk at WKEF/WRGT in Dayton, it’s great to be back in the Queen City.\nThis marks my 20th anniversary in television news and it’s a journey that started out on the other side of the country. My first job was at the CBS station in Idaho Falls, Idaho, before I returned to Ohio and joined WDTN in Dayton where I worked as a reporter and weekend anchor from 2005 to 2014.\nOhio is home. I grew up in rural Greene County and graduated from Xenia High School. I received my bachelor’s degree in mass communication from Miami University in 2003.\nSome of the most impactful stories of my career include covering the deadly Memorial Day tornadoes in Dayton in 2019 and the Oregon District mass shooting that same year.\nI’m honored to have received Associated Press, Society of Professional Journalists, Edward R. Murrow, and Emmy awards for my work.\nWhen I’m not in the newsroom you can usually find me on the sideline of a soccer field or basketball court cheering on my 11-year-old stepson. My husband is a Cincinnati native and we love calling the Tri-State home.\nIf you see us about and about, please say hello and feel free to reach out if you have a story you think needs to be told.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"6","custom_gray_stationname":"wxix","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-05-15T18:05:43.368Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T16:44:41.628Z","description":{"basic":"When

Before coming to Cincinnati in July 2016, I was a reporter and fill-in anchor for ABC22/FOX45 in Dayton. I covered everything from breaking news to the enforcement of Ohio’s exotic animal law and the ongoing efforts to revitalize the city of Dayton.\nBefore coming to Ohio I was an anchor and reporter for WMDT 47 in Maryland. During my time there I earned two AP awards for in-depth documentary reports on the area homeless and a series I started called “Delmarva’s Unsolved Crimes”.\nI got my start at KPLR in St. Louis as a feature reporter. During my time there I was nominated for an Emmy on a pop culture story, putting a spotlight on the program SistaKeeper, which empowers young women.\nI studied broadcast journalism at the University of Central Missouri. I also graduated with a Masters of Arts in Digital Multimedia from Lindenwood University.\nWhen I am not working I'm usually out with my husband checking out new dishes at local restaurants or I'll get experimental in the kitchen. I'm such a foodie. Cycling and reading are a few of my other hobbies, so you may see me rolling around town on two wheels.\nI am so excited to call Cincinnati home. The community has been so welcoming I look forward to sharing your stories in an effort to make a difference. If something is happening in your community please contact me so that I help make your voice heard.","native_app_rendering":false,"podcasts":[],"role":"FOX19 NOW

Fearing my parents would be deported, as a child, I turned to news broadcasting to keep me updated on the immigration and deportation climate. It was then that I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up: a reporter.\nYears later, I am fulfilling that dream.\nPrior to joining the FOX19 NOW team, I worked as a multimedia journalist for CAN-TV Chicago. My work primarily focused on covering underserved communities in the city’s south side. Because of this work, I was given the opportunity to act as a national correspondent and travel to the border city of El Paso, Texas to cover the migrant crisis following the expiration of Title 42.\nIn addition to that work, I also produced two short-form documentaries. My first documentary titled, “The Perilous Journey To The American Dream” was published by the Illinois Latino News Network and later played in a Chicago theater.

He reported there for three and a half years with 14 News- WFIE.\nIn his time as a journalist, he's covered everything from nationwide manhunts to the longest, deadliest tornado in Kentucky's history. In 2021 he was presented with the Indiana Society of Professional Journalists award for Best Feature Story.\nIn 2019, he graduated with a Master's Degree in Broadcast and Digital Journalism from Syracuse University after earning his Bachelor's Degree in Natural Science with a minor in Chemistry. He hopes to use his diverse skill set and experience to bring the best stories and news to FOX 19's viewers every night.\nBrady grew up in Lakewood, New York, just an hour and a half south of Buffalo. He's consequently a lifelong Buffalo Bills fan, and he appreciates the Bengals ending what was for him a lifelong playoff drought.\nWhen he's not reporting, he loves to read, watch movies, garden, play piano, and he recently started knitting.\nIf you have story ideas or need to reach out to Brady, email him at

I worked my way up the ladder, starting as a freelance reporter, then a full-time reporter, weekend anchor, morning show host and in 1999 was promoted to the main anchor of the Ten O’Clock News.\nPrior to television, I worked in radio, anchoring the midday news on 1530 WCKY-AM. I tell young people every day that if you want to achieve something in life you have to work hard for it! As Abraham Lincoln said, “Whatever you are, be a good one.” I try.\nI've covered a slew of local stories that have made headlines. I've also covered stories around the globe in Israel, Bosnia, Germany, the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, and the return of John Glenn into space. While you have to cover the tragedies that happen, I've always loved to write stories that make people laugh, feel good or are in some way positive.\nWhen I’m away from the station, I am with my family. I have five wonderful children, Katlynn, Spencer, Piper, Dash and Saylor. Like all you moms out there, I believe in multitasking. The four are my biological children - Spence, Piper, Dash and Saylor - and Katlynn was a gift from my sister Beth. She lost her battle with cancer in 2005 and I am raising her daughter. Five is a good number… It’s like having my own basketball team!\nI was born and raised in Newport, Kentucky. I am a 1987 alum of Newport Central Catholic and a 1992 graduate of Northern Kentucky University. I worked my way through college by juggling three and four jobs at a time and graduated without owing one penny!\nMy husband Chris Macke is also a local guy made good, graduating from the University of Kentucky and Chase Law School. He is a patent attorney, one of the smartest people I know and he's a great dad!\nI love to play sports; basketball, volleyball, softball, golf and tennis. I’m on a slew of boards and take part in charity events on a regular basis.\nIn my spare time, I started a basketball organization called the KY Royals and coach several outstanding basketball teams. I teach kids hard\nFeel free to drop me a line to talk news, kids, sports or whatever else is on your mind!\nYou can email me at
