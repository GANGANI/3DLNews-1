Shortly after that, Shaun joined 13abc.\n\nSouth Texas was home for Shaun and his wife before Toledo. He was a Weekday Reporter/Weekend Producer for KRIS, the NBC affiliate in Corpus Christi Texas. The highlight of his time there was certainly his ride with the Blue Angels during one of their visits to NAS Kingsville. The rumors of Shaun getting ill during that flight are in fact true.\n\nShaun is a Philadelphia area native. The Philadelphia Eagles cause most of his heartache, but he will stop at any moment to watch any Philly team.\n\nHe's a graduate of Syracuse University with a dual Major of Broadcast Journalism from the SI Newhouse School of Public Communication and Political Science from the College of Arts and Science.\n\nThe Hegartys have a full house at home.  The three babies aren't babies anymore!  Sadly you will not hear his wife Sara on the airwaves of Toledo radio.

In 2017, she was awarded the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award, alongside photojournalist Todd Gaertner, for hard news reporting for the story \"Waging War on Heroin\" for which they were also nominated for an Emmy.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Alexis is a die-hard Pittsburgh Steelers fan.\n\nHer career in journalism began when her mother and grandmother forced her to attend a journalism workshop in her sophomore year of high school. The week-long workshop taught her the basics of the craft, which is when she decided to pursue a career in the field of broadcasting. She then attended Hampton University where she graduated with a degree in Mass Media Arts.\n\nAfter graduation, Alexis headed back home to work for Sheridan Broadcasting Networks. She reported the news and traffic for WAMO Radio. She also worked at WTAE-TV, the ABC affiliate. She helped to produce the weekend morning and noon newscasts. She also spent two years at WKJG-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana, as a general assignment reporter and spent time as a freelance journalist for WXYZ in Detroit.\n\nAlexis really thought becoming a reporter would pay her the big bucks. Boy, was she wrong! The only glamorous thing about television is meeting people, telling their stories, and making lots of friends. That's what she loves!\n\nAlexis was featured in the Sierah Joughin documentary Buried in the Backyard: Sierah Joughin Vanishes From Ohio on Oxygen. Over her career, she has gained national attention for stories reported right here in Toledo, including her ongoing coverage of the three Toledo pastors convicted of sex trafficking a minor.\n\nIn November, the Toledo Urban Federal Credit Union will honor Alexis for her hard work and dedication to the community.\n\nIn her spare time, Alexis is probably working out, watching sports or traveling. She is also very active in the community.
