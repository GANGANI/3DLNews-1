The NRA claimed that \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/30/supreme-court-national-rifle-association-new-york/73116504007/\" target=\"_blank\">Vullo coerced DFS-regulated entities to punish or suppress the NRA's advocacy\u003c/a> for gun rights. The Second Circuit court had previously ruled that Vullo's actions were permissible government speech and legitimate law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the NRA's allegations, if true, could be seen as a violation of the First Amendment. The court's decision was based on the principle that government officials cannot use their power to punish or suppress speech they disfavor, either directly or indirectly through private intermediaries.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court, reaffirming the principle established six decades ago in Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, that \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/supreme-court-first-amendment/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">government entities cannot use the threat of legal sanctions\u003c/a> or other means of coercion to suppress disfavored speech.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The ruling allows the NRA to proceed with its lawsuit, which could have significant implications for the relationship between government agencies and private entities.\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://www.iheart.com/content/2024-05-30-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-nra-in-first-amendment-case/","cuser":"user/ldap/cccnyc1wjg","enable_featured_widget":true,"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"featured_widget":{"country":"","id":"","kind":"","related_id":""},"feed_content_id":"","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"include_video_monetization":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":["keywords/ai-assisted"],"primary_image":{"bucket":"assets.getty","id":"%2F6658b772bf45e28c2c115b13"},"primary_target":{"categories":["categories/national-news","categories/politics"],"distribution":["brands/iHeartRadio"]},"publish_date":1717090380000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/iHeartRadio","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2024-05-30-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-nra-in-first-amendment-case","social_title":"","summary":"The

The NRA claimed that \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/30/supreme-court-national-rifle-association-new-york/73116504007/\" target=\"_blank\">Vullo coerced DFS-regulated entities to punish or suppress the NRA's advocacy\u003c/a> for gun rights. The Second Circuit court had previously ruled that Vullo's actions were permissible government speech and legitimate law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>However, the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the NRA's allegations, if true, could be seen as a violation of the First Amendment. The court's decision was based on the principle that government officials cannot use their power to punish or suppress speech they disfavor, either directly or indirectly through private intermediaries.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court, reaffirming the principle established six decades ago in Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, that \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/supreme-court-first-amendment/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">government entities cannot use the threat of legal sanctions\u003c/a> or other means of coercion to suppress disfavored speech.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The ruling allows the NRA to proceed with its lawsuit, which could have significant implications for the relationship between government agencies and private entities.\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://www.iheart.com/content/2024-05-30-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-nra-in-first-amendment-case/","cuser":"user/ldap/cccnyc1wjg","enable_featured_widget":true,"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"featured_widget":{"country":"","id":"","kind":"","related_id":""},"feed_content_id":"","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"include_video_monetization":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":["keywords/ai-assisted"],"primary_image":{"bucket":"assets.getty","id":"%2F6658b772bf45e28c2c115b13"},"primary_target":{"categories":["categories/national-news","categories/politics"],"distribution":["brands/iHeartRadio"]},"publish_date":1717090380000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/iHeartRadio","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2024-05-30-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-nra-in-first-amendment-case","social_title":"","summary":"The

The NRA alleges that the DFS violated its First Amendment rights by urging banks and insurance companies to sever ties with the gun rights organization.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The case, National Rifle Association of America v.
