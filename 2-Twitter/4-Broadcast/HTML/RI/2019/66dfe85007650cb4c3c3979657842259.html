<h5>Our 6th Induction </h5>

<h5>About John Rose Putnam</h5>

<h5>John came west as a young man and settled in Berkeley where he graduated from 
the University of California. He still lives and writes there and often gives 
a talk on the California gold rush to the gang at the Freight and Salvage.</h5>

<h5>He spent a lot of time digging into that gold rush too and many of his stories 
take place back then. John's characters are so real they'll jump right off the 
page and talk to you; his villains have hearts as cold as midnight and his 
heroes almost always do the right thing in the end.</h5>

<h5>He's working up quite a reputation for his knowledge of that era too. His blog, 
My Gold Rush Tales, attracted the interest of some TV folks and he appeared in 
a segment for the Travel Channel about Henry Meiggs, the man who built 
San Francisco's Famous/Popular Fisherman's Wharf.</h5>

<h5>While his first novel, Hangtown Creek, a story of adventure, romance, and coming 
of age in the early days of the gold rush, was published in 2011, his brand new 
book, Into the Face of the Devil, moves between Hangtown and the sawmill where 
James Marshall first found gold, and pits a young man in love for the first time 
against a killer so evil he could pass for Satan.</h5>

<h5>Our 9th Induction </h5>

<h5>About S. Jackson</h5>

<h5>I grew up in a small Kansas (USA) town and I lived in more than one state since then. At this time, my husband and I split our time between Kansas and Colorado (we love the mountains and off road 4-wheeling). Traveling is one of our most favorite things to do and I always have a book or even three books that I read, in the same week. Books were really my thing. It seemed like every time I turned around I was obtaining a new library card due to the current one being stamped complete. Diving into a good book made any day perfect and you would be surprised at the number of books I read over and over. I drew paper dolls and clothes for them, and using watercolor as my medium when painting scenes, especially flowers. I continued with art in high school exploring a wide variety of arts and I loved it! The creative side of me loves to be an amateur, shutter-bug, and we actually have an online art gallery. In college I went into the sciences of all things and received a Bachelor's degree in the Science of Nursing. My nursing career was highly successful and I hung up my nursing hat in December 2012. </h5>

<h5>Our 11th Induction </h5>

<h5>About R.C. Carter</h5>

<h5>My wife and I have both had a life long ambition to be authors. For me it began with my love for JRR Tolkien's writing's, especially the Hobbit. For my wife it began with her love of the writing's of Isaac Asimov and Agatha Christie. For the past forty years we have been busy with careers, raising children and watching grandchildren grow. Through the years, we have been involved with small theatre groups. Many of the skits and plays we wrote ourselves or in collaboration with others. We now live four hours away from our children and their families. So, we find ourselves with some free time. We decided if we were ever going to write a book it had to be now.</h5>

<h5>We are the proud parents of 6 children, who are the proud parents of 12 children. We also love paranormal investigating. We have investigated many sites on our own. We also enjoy going on ghost hunts with Ghost Hunt Weekends led by Chad Morin and celebrity guest ghost hunters. Ideal Events is also another favorite ghost hunting experience for us. We've investigated in private homes, Ft Mifflin, St.Augustine Lighthouse, Sloss Furnace and Moon River Brewery.</h5>

<h5>We also love to travel and cruise.</h5>

<h5>Our 14th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Ken Stark</h5>

<h5>Ken was born in Saskatchewan, but has called Vancouver home for most of his life. He was raised on a steady diet of science fiction and disaster movies, so it seems right that his first published book series be about the zombie apocalypse. In his spare time, Ken tries to paint like Bob Ross and play poker like Doyle Brunson, but results suggest that he might have got it all backwards.</h5>

<h5> 
About HM Holten</h5>

<h5>Born in Denmark, I grew up in a scholastic family with Croatian, Swedish, and German ties. My family took a large interest in literature and music. Academia didn't attract me, but I learned to read and played several instruments before I started school. I've worked in all wakes of life, starting as a ground hostess in the Copenhagen Airport. In London I took on Pizza Hut, as well as The Danish Embassy, as a cook. I also worked as an assistant dry cleaner and in a candle shop. In between I took an education in Body Massage (ITEC). I've designed costumes for several productions at a Children's Opera, and managed more than one chamber music group. After graduating as an opera singer, I alternatively performed, gave concerts and taught people to sing. A favourite pastime has always been painting and I had a showcase in Guildford. Performing and teaching gave me a keen eye for details and so has travelling and living abroad. My reading habits are both inspiring and educational, something I regard as decisive when I started to write diaries, poetry, and other observations. Eventually that sparked my interest in composing a full-scale novel. My family history presented the setting and influenced the story line of 'Snares and Delusions'. I moved to Germany a few years ago but preserve strong connections with the UK.

<h5>Our 17th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Vicky Whedbee </h5>

<h5>  Vicky Whedbee was born and raised in Daytona Beach, Florida, where she resided until her 40's when she relocated to San Mateo, Florida, where she currently resides with her husband. An avid reader, she wrote her first novel over a period of years as a labor of love and fulfillment of a life long dream that began with the encouragement of her Engish teacher in high school.
With a diagnosis of cancer for her dad, she decided to become an independent author and published her novel on her own in order to present a finished product to her father before his demise. She was in the process of reading said novel, "Things He Hadn't Told Her", to him at the time of his passing. She wrote her second novel "Sarah's Song", which was a collaboration with her father set in the time of his childhood in the rural Appalachian mountains, with notes taken prior to his demise. Both books have been met with stellar 5-STAR reviews on Amazon & Goodreads, as well as awarded the 5-STAR review seal from Reader's Favorite. 
After numerous requests, she wrote a sequel to Sarah's Song, titled Sarah's Home, which could also be read as a stand-alone. It, too, is being received with love and 5-STAR reviews.
She is currently working on her next novel. </h5>

<h5> About Andrew Wilkes </h5>

<h5>Who am I? Itâs a reasonable question! I am a happily married man, I have three brilliant children and an adopted daughter who is now an adult.<br><br>

I also have Autism, I wasnât diagnosed with it until I was in my mid thirties. The Autism has been a little bit of a stumbling block, prior to being diagnosed I was medicated for something else and that made journeying into the world even harder. <br><br>

I mentioned I was married, I am, to a wonderful women called Emma! Without her I wouldnât be the man I am today and I certainly would not have my children. Emma has helped me through a great deal of woes, from depression to severe panic attacks that have left me physically unable to move... <br><br>

What I do? I spend a fair bit of my time doting on my family, I think for all of us, our children are the reason we get up in the morning - the other I do is write.

<h5>Our 25th Induction </h5>

<h5> About the Author </h5>

<h5>Janet Leigh Green lives in Fort Worth, Texas with her husband, Singer, Songwriter, and Producer, Tuffy Green. Janet appreciates her extensive career in the financial industry, but hopes to transition into a career as a full time author. This is Janet's debut novel, and it is the first of a four book series. Unspeakable Acts introduces four strong and exciting characters who work together to uncover some disturbingly dark secrets that will chill the reader to their core. Janet loved her characters so much, she didn't want to say goodbye. Despicable Witch is the second book in the series, and the McQueen Investigation team is catapulted into a sinister past attached to an old New Orleans coven. Janet has dreamed of being an author since she began reading full length novels at the age of six, but life took her in a different direction until recently. When asked what she does in her spare time she says, "My talented husband is teaching me to play guitar. My Dad left his guitar to me when he died, and I want to fulfill a promise I made to him just before he was called home. Music was special to my dad and I, and he taught me to sing when I was two. My husband is the true musician though, so I'll write scary stories and he can write amazing songs and sing them!" </h5>

<h5>Our 28th Induction </h5>

<h5> About James Marchiori </h5>
<h5>		
James Marchiori was born in Venice, Italy and wanted to be a writer from an early age. He wrote his first verses at nine years old after reading in secret Edgar Allan Poe's tales and poems. He's been collecting various literary awards across Italy and Europe being part of an essential cultural organisation. He's been devoting his years between the professional and the artistic life always studying the works of his great masters from Edgar Allan Poe to Antonin Artaud, AndrÃ© Breton and the Surrealism era passing through Tristan Tzara and the Dadaism movement. At twenty-one years old he published his first book of selected poems with a Venetian Publishing House, thanks to which other two poetry anthologies and short stories were out before his 28th birthday. His professional career brought him around the world from London to Los Angeles and New York, but he never stopped writing and studying philosophy and literature always taking tons of notes with him no matter where his job experiences were heading to.<br><br>

He got first a degree as Master of Arts for the Hairdressing Industry which provided him with the qualification to teach new apprentices in his country of origin, and later he accomplished his beloved studies in Psychology and Education.<br><br>

He's been writing songs and playing gigs as a frontman in various bands while achieving a significant source of gratification being awarded at the European Parliament in Brussels for one of his poems in 2002. His studies always continue on the French Symbolism with Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Verlaine, MallarmÃ¨ and likewise with Byron, Blake, Keats; He also spent time in an accurate study of the Bohemian Style of life endorsed by Baudelaire to name but one.<br><br>

Between 2012 and 2014 he has been collecting other prestigious prizes in London, Barcelona and Prague, always regarding Poetry competitions. He conceived a novel dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe because he wanted him to be considered above all a man with an anguished soul and a genius mind so over these past years he collected all his notes about his life and did an extensive analysis on the nineteenth century geographical and historical scenario.<br><br>

Once completed the full manuscript, he was first published by an Italian Publishing House in 2015 and got very positive reviews and feedbacks.<br><br>

In the 2018 Summer, the second novel in Italian which is an atypical work being an autobiography/diary about his whole life and career as a talented artistic director in the hairdressing industry, a book as an expression of his original essence and substance. In the same year, a special edition of collected poems will be out on the Italian marketplace.<br><br>

Within 2018 that very first novel celebrating Edgar Allan Poe and the gothic fiction will be on sale worldwide in the English version. 2019 will see his early English collected poems anthology.<br><br>

He's also working on a crime story series set in Dublin, Ireland, entirely dedicated to the country he is based in, which he loves deeply.

<h5>Our 29th Induction </h5>

<h5>		
About Susanne Leist </h5>

<h5>
I have always loved to read. Agatha Christie, Alistair Maclean, Robert Ludlum, and many other authors filled my young imagination with intrigue and mystery. When I wasn't reading late into the night, the TV shows--Murder She Wrote and Columbo--entertained me with tales of murder and suspense.<br><br>

Over the years, my taste in TV expanded to include such shows as Supernatural and The Originals. I searched for paranormal, murder mysteries but found few at the library or bookstore. So, I wrote one.<br><br>

The Dead Game, Book One of The Dead Game series, brings fantasy and the surreal to the classic murder mystery with dead bodies, suspects, and clues. It offers vampires, vampire derivatives, and a touch of romance to spice the motley mix. <br><br>

The story continues in Book Two, Prey for The Dead, as The Dead vampires use an exclusive club in Disney World to infiltrate the rich and Famous/Popular. As The Dead grow in power, not even the bright sunshine of Florida can weaken them. Linda, my main character, and her friends join forces with human vampires--known as hybrids--to defeat the evil threatening to control Oasis. A masquerade ball and a romp through the tunnels beneath the town lead to a showdown in the swamps of southern Florida.<br><br>

A career in writing has been a big leap for me. Accustomed to the number-crunching field of budgeting and the hectic commodity markets, I left my first career and M.B.A. in Finance behind to pursue my dream. I do not regret my foray into literature for one moment. Fellow authors helped me make my way through the competitive field. I write every day and even tried my hand at poetry. If someone tells you it's too late in life to try something different, they are wrong. It is never too late to follow your heart.

<h5> About Cheryl Carpinello </h5>

<h5>



I'm a retired high school English teacher. A devourer of books growing up, my profession introduced me to writings and authors from times long past. Through my studies and teaching, I fell in love with the Ancient and Medieval Worlds. Now, I hope to inspire young readers and those Young-at-Heart to read more through my Tales and Legends for Reluctant Readers set in these worlds--Ancient Egypt, Medieval Wales, and coming soon, the ancient world of Atlantis.<br><br>

My husband and I love to travel. Because I'm also a retired airline employee, we were fortunate, in 2008, to spend three weeks in Egypt traveling by local train from one end of the country to the other. In 2014, we spent three weeks in the UK driving over 1700 miles through England, Wales, and Scotland. </h5>

<h5>Our 32nd Induction </h5>

<h5> About Peter C Bradbury </h5>

<h5> I am a former, traditional English butler, from near Manchester, England. I have lived in the USA since 1994, currently living in Isleton, CA., but also ten years in Dallas, Texas.</h5>

<h5>My new book is called, 'Stone Dead in Rio Vista.'.</h5>

<h5>Rio Vista sits on the Sacramento River, and I work there in the golf club as a server. As many of the members have purchased and enjoyed my previous novels, many of them asked me to include them as characters in books. I did, combined some of them, added new characters, and put them together in 'Stone Dead.' .</h5>

<h5>The story revolves around the country club in Rio Vista, which becomes the scene of a murder. This rattles the community of over-55's, as they're only used to their fellow members dying of natural causes. When another golfer gets killed, their anxiety only gets worse. .</h5>

<h5>The killer is very careful and clever, and with no apparent motive to go on, the police officer in charge struggles to find any evidence. .</h5>

<h5>This is a really fun book that will hook you in on the first page.
My last novel was called 'Burnt.'.</h5>

<h5>This tells the story of Tiffany, an 11 yr. old girl without a care in the world. Until her younger brother gets kidnapped. After finally waking up from an induced coma, Tiffany has horrific memories and is in excruciating pain. The only thing that drives her on is seeking justice for herself and her family. .</h5>

<h5>I was always being asked what life was like as a butler, and that was what made me write "Stonebridge Manor." Day to day happenings can be humdrum, even with Famous/Popular guests or employers, so I changed the book into a novel and it is now a murder/mystery. It is getting great reviews and is very often re-read. .</h5>

<h5>I have also written "Prospects", which was inspired by the vast amounts of missing people there are. Thousands go missing every year. Men, women, children, old and young, some intentionally, some not. In the book, Alex targets young professional beautiful women, who are single and new to the city. As Alex is rich, very intelligent and extremely good looking, he has no problem in attracting the women, but he looks on them as prospects. Prospects to kill eventually, if everything goes smoothly, and if he doesn't have the stomach to do it, his brother certainly does. .</h5>

<h5>There is also "Consequences," which is about a man who is trying to expel his demons from years of being a victim to bullies. This novel was inspired by one of my grandsons, Bryce, who is in school in Florida and his life is being made hellish by cowardly bullies. Although I wouldn't advocate the way James deals with his former bullies, it is true that if you pick on the wrong person, then there may eventually be "Consequences." .</h5>

<h5>My fourth book is "The Innocent Children" which in some ways was a follow on to "Prospects." Researching the number of missing people in the USA, it is a fact that of those who are trafficked, around 80% of them are forced into being slaves to sexual predators. Young boys and mainly girls with an average age of 11 are the favored targets, either home grown or smuggled into the country. This book, which I wrote as a novel, focuses on the children involved in human trafficking, here in the USA. .</h5>

<h5>butler, has meant that it has been very difficult to find work recently, so I happily type away on my laptop, making my books very readable and entertaining. I have also returned to the restaurant trade. .</h5>

<h5>A big soccer and golf fan, I also enjoy other sports, but my schedule still revolves around my team's kick off time back in old blighty

<h5>Our 33rd Induction </h5>

<h5> About Glenn Stevens </h5>


<h5> 
"The blood is the life!" Bram Stoker once wrote in his Famous/Popular novel titled "Dracula". How powerful and true. Blood is the life for, without it, we die. This raises the stakes in the taking or giving of it. Life can be saved or lost with or without it.</h5>
<h5> 
Glenn grew up in Chicago glued to the TV watching Dark Shadows every afternoon. In that highly rated series, it was Barnabas Collins who first ignited Glenn's passion for blood and vampire stories. The more romantic and erotic vampire stories like Dracula and the many films by Hammer set that passion ablaze.</h5>
<h5> 
To satisfy Glenn's thirst for more - more blood, seduction, suspense, romance, passion, sex, realism, and of course bite scenes, Glenn set out to write his own flavor of vampire stories. His take on vampires is different from the mainstream which is that his vampires are not the traditional monsters but rather lovers who protect their human companion's and seek to find a complicated balance of feeding their hunger without killing those that satisfy it. Glenn calls this the true love and conflict in his stories.</h5>
<h5> 
All of Glenn's vampire treats can be found on Amazon in eBook, paperback and audio-book formats - many of which have received a Reader's Favorite 5 Star review. If you're like Glenn, maybe you too are searching for something different in vampire stories. If you are, please take a look at what Glenn has to offer. Hope you enjoy what you find!

<h5> About Gloria Antypowich </h5>


<h5>

Gloria Antypowich writes Contemporary Adult Fiction. In 2015 she published the Belanger Creek Ranch Series, a group of four books that can be read as stand alone, but will enrich the readers experience if they are read in sequence. The series focuses on a group of people who have become as close as family because of the friendships they have created through their business relationships with the Belanger Creek Ranch.<br><br>

Gloria grew up on a farm and most of her married life has been lived on a ranch. Human relationships fascinate her. Ideas for stories can be found everywhere; over-heard conversations in a public place, a couple fighting in a restaurant, a story in the news, even a chance remark in a conversation with a friend. She is enamored with the power of words and she loves to use them to paint images of characters that become so real, they feel like they could be your next door neighbor.<br><br>

She does not believe that relationships are merrily "happy ever after." Relationships require commitment, give and take, compromise and consideration for each other: in other words they take work! Each individual has their own ideas, beliefs and needs. Environment, upbringing and life experiences affect their personality and character. Nothing is simple or automatically agreeable.<br><br>

Gloria is an avid reader of several different genres and listens to a wide selection of music. A good game of cards, sharing a laugh with a friend over a glass of wine and spending time with her family are a few of her favorite things to do. She loves to write and says her husband was her inspiration for the heroes in this series of books. He was a cowboy, a rancher--and a lover. Gloria lives with her husband, in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada. They are retired now, but they still have "chemistry".  </h5>

He left school at the age of 15 and worked as a cook, waiter, plate collector and washer-up in his parents transport cafe before joining the Royal Navy in 1973. As an Aircraft Handler/Crash-Rescue Fireman he served on Great Britain's last true fixed wing aircraft carrier, HMS Ark Royal before she was scrapped in 1978. Yes he hears the cries of derision from serving and former members of the Fleet Air Arm who served in big ships since the "Big A" was scrapped, but even the Royal Navy called them through-deck cruisers and they didn't have catapults to launch them, nor aircraft landing at 250 knots. <br><br>

Since leaving the Royal Navy he has worked as a long distance class 1HGV driver, drayman, fettler and mechanical engineer. He worked on contract in Libya and in 1995 became a Bachelor of Science after graduating with a 2:1 honours degree from Bournemouth University. A motorcycle accident in 2000 left him with serious injuries, finished his engineering career and almost his life. He now lives in Poole in Dorset and after many years writing stories for his own amusement has been prompted by friends and family to publish some of them.<br><br>

The Second of his books, The British FrontLine, follows Royal Marine Sergeant Patrick Regan who is repatriated from the fighting in Afghanistan to bury his mother and step father, after they are killed in an explosion that destroyed their yacht. On returning back to Great Britain, Regan finds out his half-sister, Susie, is missing and he sets about finding her. The body count begins to rise when he discovers that Susie has been abducted by Russian Mafia gangsters. <br><br>

Thomas is currently writing the Third in this series, which will be published around the middle to end of 2018.</h5>

<h5> Our 43rd Induction </h5>


<h5>About David W. Thompson</h5>


<h5> 
David W. Thompson is an award winning author, a native of Southern Maryland, and a graduate of University of Maryland, University College. David's love of the written word began early in life. He claims his first writing effort was "Dick and Jane" fan fiction when he was six years old- no doubt with a dark twist! <br><br>

After his family and cheesecake, reading was his first love. It exposed him to people, cultures and ideas he'd never experience otherwise. Writing was a natural extension of this "out of body" experience as characters act as tour guides to their worlds, and their possibilities. He hopes to honestly convey the stories that they whisper in his ears. <br><br>

When he isn't writing, Dave enjoys time with his family and grandchildren, kayaking (mostly flat water please), fishing, hiking, archery, wine-making, and pursuing his other "creative passion"- woodcarving. 
For more on Dave, his current releases and upcoming WIP,

<h5> Our 46th Induction </h5>

<h5>About Bobbie Barker</h5>

<h5>Bobbie Barker was brought up in Islington, London, in the 60's which is a far cry from how it's known today - it wasn't all cafÃ©'s and bistro's back then and life wasn't easy. Her education wasn't deemed as a necessity, it was more important back then to get a job and bring in the house-keeping, and that's what she did as soon as she was old enough to leave school. Bobbie worked in advertising before having her family, then later in the public sector. Now she dedicates her time to writing full time - a long-term ambition she is finally able to fulfill, inspired by the highs and lows of her life's experiences.</h5>

<h5> Our 48th Induction </h5>

<h5>About JoAnn Wagner</h5>
<h5>
After being in the medical field for 35 years, JoAnn became an author of children's books in 2014. Her journey as an author began in May 2014 when her pastor gave the church members a pink flying pig stress ball and asked them to post pictures on Facebook so the congregation would know where they are spending their vacation (kind of like Flat Stanley). Instead of posting pictures of herself, she asked everyone she met if she could take their picture and post it.<br><br>

People loved meeting Sir Pigglesworth and they smiled and laughed, telling her how adorable they thought he was. She started posting little quotes with the pig doing various fun things and soon her friends and her followers told her they and their kids were looking forward to seeing what Sir Pigglesworth was up to next...A STAR WAS BORN!<br><br>

JoAnn says "I can't believe I'm a published author! It was the furthest thing from my mind when I considered what my retirement would be like. I love doing book signings at local bookstores and readings at schools, libraries, daycare centers and churches."<br><br>

JoAnn and her husband live in Mesquite, TX and they travel a lot with their hoofed friend to do research for his adventures. She has published 8 books in the series so far with more to come! </h5>

<h5> Our 49th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Ingrid Foster </h5>


<h5>

Fantasy Suspense Author Ingrid Foster was born in a small town in Pennsylvania and grew up on a farm surrounded by old stone houses and five generations of family. Having developed a rich love of writing and an intense curiosity for all things unusual and unknown, she left home after high school to join the Air Force and explore the world. There, aside from earning her bachelor's degree and three associate degrees, she traveled whenever possible to the usual European cities, but also places like Dover, England, Utrecht, Holland, Dachau, Germany and Murano, Italy. Upon leaving the military, her IT technician and leadership skills eventually led her to a position as IT Project Manager, a position she loved and found ideal. That is, until she met an adventurous Australian with an equal love of traveling and a desire to make his new wife happy. Two and a half years in Australia and thirty US states later, they found their "perfect place" to live, a farm in the Desert Southwest. There this author writes stories using her own adventures (or misadventures) and impressions as fodder.

<h5> Our 50th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Cindy J Smith </h5>

<h5>
As far back as she can remember, Cindy J. Smith has written poetry, and with every experience in life, she has found inspiration. Wife, Mother and Grandmother, she has a myriad of beautiful memories to draw from. Never having been good at playing the part of "starving artist", she has had many careers, but her current one, an over-the-road truck driver with her husband, Dave, has provided amazing opportunities for inspiration in her later years.<br><br>

She published her first collection of poetry, Voices In My Head, originally in 2011. Publishing was something her daughter had always wanted her to do so she dedicated this in her memory. In July of 2013, Cindy published her second book, They Won't Shut Up as a birthday gift to her angel daughter. In the back of this collection, several poems written by Jasmine are included. Later that year she republished both of these independently. In 2015 Cindy published Rhymes Through Time. This anthology was different than the first two first as it was much smaller (about 60 poems instead of 140+) and it was done completely randomly. Rhymes also has a sampling of poems from the first two books. Cindy published a children's book, Caesar And The Bluebells, in 2016. Caesar is being re-illustrated and should be available again soon. Her last book of poetry is Words On The Wind which was also published in 2016. Like Rhymes, this collection is random and is not as big as the first two. <br><br>

Currently, Cindy is working on the follow up to the Caesar book and a "real novel" that she started in November when she participated in NANO. She also has a project titled "365" that is a poetry collection. This project has one poem written every day. At this point she is up to date with 80 poems written as of 3/21/17.

While working in the steel processing business for almost fifteen years, Laurence's place of employment changed hands, for the third time in 2006; fighting for his job, again. In the same year his first granddaughter, Kendall, "Papa's Angel" was born. He described this as one of the most uplifting moments of his life. In addition, it was during this time when his emotions were running wild; he became inspired as well as determined to write his penned-up thoughts on paper.<br><br>

Nearly four years later, he had completed his first teen fantasy novel, Metatron: The Angel Has Risen. Metatron: The Mystical Blade was published in 2014. Dagger of Mortality release date will be March 15, 2018. The fourth novel in the series will be released sometime in 2019.<br><br>

<h5> Our 55th Induction </h5>

<h5>About L. L. Thomsen</h5>

<h5>
Originally from Denmark, now resident in the UK since forever and a day, fantasy author L. L. Thomsen, began her writing journey relatively late. This is to say that like most people who never had an instant calling, she tampered with other things like archaeology & prehistory, teaching and shop work for a while. However, with the birth of her first child, so was her muse discovered and whether a demon or an angel, this 'muse-who-must-be-obeyed' has yet to let her down. <br><br>

Interested in the idea of mixing it up, L. L.'s work include multiple genres under one title - grimdark, romance, mystery, sword and magic, adventure - her series: The Missing Shield, is far from your average read.<br><br>

L. L. is inspired by Wurts, Hobb, Erikson, and Martin. She endeavours to look beneath the surface of her characters, whilst providing the reader with an epic experience full of visual truth and elaborate world building. She always puts the best and worst into the melting pot, always making hers a guaranteed unique read.<br><br>

L. L. currently lives with her family + two cats and a dog, in the back-of-beyond near Sherwood Forrest. She's yet to discover the truth about the Universe, but feels she sometimes comes close. Without Coffee, Chinese food and candles, the world would be a much darker place. If you like to chat books and writing, please feel free to drop her a line anytime. Her inbox is only a click away.</h5>

<h5> Our 58th Induction </h5>

<h5>About Virginia K. White</h5>

<h5> 
Virginia K. White was born in South Dakota but grew up in Nebraska. She taught English in NE, Wy, and CO. Kids, teaching, writing, and animals are among the things she loves. After 40 years in the classroom, she was able to put those loves together and write for young readers, a long time goal. She reads and talks to young readers in elementary schools as well as volunteers in the classroom of one of her former students, now an art teacher. Her philosophy is "If you write for young readers, you need to be around young readers!" <br><br>

She recently adopted three rescue cats who had become a family in Fur the Love of Paws rescue facility. Sprite, Fanta, and Willy have added entertainment and new ideas for stories. She lives in CO with her husband and enjoys spending time with her grandchildren. <br><br>

After too long, Virginia finally has a website! https://www.virginiakwhite.com. If you click on "More" you will find some pictures of my feline inspiration. If you go to About Me, you will find some fun pictures of my time with family. <br><br>

I continue to be guided by Bublish, the biggest help I have had in creating my stories. I am proud to announce that Glasses for Margie was a finalist in the Colorado Authors' League book award contest. She is helping me create a sequel. A new picture book, another fun cat book, is on its way.

<h5> Our 60th Induction </h5>

<h5>About Elizabeth Horton-Newton</h5>

<h5> 
Elizabeth Horton-Newton has been called the Seductress of Suspense because she draws readers into her stories, builds the suspense, and just when the solution seems to be obvious, she pulls the rabbit out of the hat and reveals a dark truth. Her lifelong interest in the Kennedy assassination conspiracy resulted in her first novel, "View From the Sixth Floor: An Oswald Tale". With the release of her second book, "Riddle", she once again tackles a social issue; the illegal adoption of First Nations babies separated from their families. Small town prejudices against people of color and "outsiders" results in a unique friendship between two young people. Weaving a romantic thriller around the issues, she creates rich characters in all her writing, drawing the reader into their lives. With her education in Criminal Psychology, Sociology, and Media Communications she offers a unique insight into how criminals think and how society responds to their crimes. Volunteering in local Domestic Violence groups in her hometown, she likes to confront social problems in her stories. A member of the Tennessee Author's Guild, Elizabeth currently lives in a 100-year old haunted house with her husband, writer Neil Douglas Newton, and her dog, Scout (named for a character in "To Kill a Mockingbird"). Not limited to a single genre, she has written erotic romance, "Carved Wooden Heart" (with the mysterious Starla Hartless), and the suspenseful "Stolen Gypsy", as well as novelettes through Electric Eclectic Books. She is currently working on a new novel, "Blood on Murder Highway", loosely based on the murders and disappearances of indigenous women in the Pacific Northwest. There is also a crime noir novella in the works and an anthology of short stories and poems she's written over the years. When she isn't writing she is usually traveling or taking photographs and often both simultaneously.

<h5> Our 63rd Induction </h5>

<h5>About Paul Hollis</h5>

<h5>
Paul Hollis grew up during a time when the notion of a shrinking world was still in its infancy. People lived in rural communities or in city neighborhoods, rarely venturing far beyond the bordered rim of their lives. But as a kid, Paul tumbled off the edge of the yard reaching for greener grass. Having lived in twelve states and eventually working in all fifty, he fell in love early with seeing the world on someone else's money. Since then, he has lived abroad nine years while working in forty-eight countries, spanning five continents. These experiences helped inspire the novels in The Hollow Man series. From traveling through Europe as a young man, to flying nearly three million miles which took him nowhere near home, to teaching companies worldwide about coming global implications, as a world tourist Paul Hollis brings his own unique viewpoint to his mesmerizing thrillers.
<br><br>
Paul has a dual BA in English literature and psychology from the University of Illinois. In addition to having worked for IBM and others in worldwide physical and video security, he is an active member of International Thriller Writers and the St. Louis Writers Guild, as well as an international conference speaker.

<h5>About Michael Timmins</h5>

<h5>
Michael was born in Sylvania, Ohio. A suburb of Toledo. He spent most of his adult life living in Northwest Ohio and began writing at an early age, but never thought to publish any of his works. He got a sense that his writing skill might be used to author a novel when writing campaigns for his D&D group. After several years of starting and stopping he finished his first work "The Awakening: Part One." which was immediately followed by, "The Awakening: Part Two." Both novels are Book One of "The Lycan War Saga," with, "The Gathering" Book Two of "The Lycan War Saga" set to be released early 2019. Michael also released, "Prelude to the Shards," an Anthology set in a world he created and is the first book of a new series, "Shards of the Coven."</h5>

<h5>Michael resides in Toledo with his beautiful wife and his two amazing sons.</h5>

<h5> Our 67th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Rafael Amadeus Hines </h5>

<h5>
Rafael Amadeus Hines is a native New Yorker with Panamanian, Jamaican, and Irish roots, who was born and raised on Manhattanâs Lower East Side. Dipping into his early Alphabet City memories, he loosely based many of the characters in his first novel, Bishopâs War, on the people he grew up with, and adapted many of his own experiences into the book as well.<br><br>

Rafael is a former Jazz club owner and restaurateur, and has worked in the financial and energy markets for over twenty years. On 9/11 he watched his office along with all the others in the Twin Towers come crashing down and, like many New Yorkers on that day, he anticipated follow up attacks to take place throughout the city. Years later he envisioned a lone citizen soldier preventing these attacks and the hero Sgt. John Bishop appeared on paper.<br><br>

Rafael is the father of three and still lives in the New York neighborhood where he grew up. A voracious reader of suspense thrillers, his writing career was inspired by legendary artist-authors Elmore Leonard, John Sandford, Stephen Hunter, James Lee Burke, and Tom Clancy. He is currently working on the second novel in the Bishop series, Bishopâs Law.<br><br>

<h5> Our 74th Induction </h5>

<h5> About Judy Kuhlman </h5>

<h5> 
Judy Kuhlman was born in Taft, California and she lived in many different states and Guyana, a country in South America, for a short time. She always enjoyed writing and wrote some short stories when she was younger, but never pursued writing as a career.  <br><br>

She graduated from Arizona State University and taught orchestra in elementary and middle schools for twenty-six years in Arizona and loved teaching. Her major instrument is the cello, which she has played since she was in fourth grade.
<br><br>
Because of the Coronavirus, she began listening to her grandchildren read to her by listening to them on an app on her phone called HouseParty. Her youngest grandchild was too young to read by herself, so Judy wrote some stories to read to her. She wrote about a book a week for the first few months while everyone was supposed to be staying at home as much as possible while the Covid 19 virus was spreading.
<br><br>
Judy had previously talked about writing children's books with her sister, Karyn, who was an artist. Since she had actually written some books now, she asked if Karyn would be interested in illustrating her books and she said she would.
<br><br>
Judy's wish is to entertain children and teach them some facts at the same time. The illustrations make the books fun to read, as well as highlight the basic ideas of the stories.

<h5> Our 84th Induction  </h5>
<h5> About Douglas L. Wilson </h5>

<h5>Born and raised in Northern Virginia, I've spent over 35 years in the construction business as a mechanical contractor. Forced from the industry by health concerns, I've spent the last six years following my true passion, writing. I've always been a storyteller, just ask those closest to me and watch for the eye roll, but I'm finally putting down on paper what's been trapped inside me these last 57 years. I enjoy reading supernatural thrillers above all else, and we can blame The King for that, so that's the genre in which I work. I hope you will give my rough style and layered plots a chance. Let me tell you a story.  </h5>

<h5> Our 85th Induction  </h5>
<h5> About Leigh Roberts </h5>

<h5>
When Leigh Roberts is not caught up in the fantasy world of Etera with Adia, Khon'Tor, Acaraho, OhâDar, and Nadiwani, she is enjoying the beauty of the rural area in which she lives with her husband and several spoiled Pomeranians.<br><br>

An avid reader since early childhood, she grew up on superhero comics, science fiction stories (Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov), and television shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Star Trek.<br><br>

Star Trek had a huge influence on her thinking and taught her the infinite possibilities of imaginationâand how to split infinitives. Spoiler alert: you may find a Klingon word or phrase dropped in here or there, or a blatant, unapologetic recreation of a famous Star Trek TOS scene!<br><br>

She hopes that through her writing, awareness of Sasquatch will spread, ultimately providing protection should they be proven to exist.<br><br>

She loves being an author, and her heartâs desire is to be writing for a long, long time to come. Following Series One: Wrak-Ayya The Age of Shadows, will come Wrak-Wavara The Age of Darkness and then Wrak-Ashwea The Age of Light.
