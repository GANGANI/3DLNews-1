She grew up in Gardner, Kansas, so she is no stranger to KC. She is excited to work in her home market alongside the journalists she grew up watching. \n\nShe attended the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (Go Gophers!) and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism. During college, she interned with The Wake Magazine, WESH2 News in Orlando, Florida, and the talk show ‘Twin Cities Live.’ She also had a mentorship with the Twin Cities PBS show, ‘Almanac at the Capitol.’\n\nShe comes from KSNW News in Wichita, where she anchored and reported. She covered a variety of stories, including farming in the drought, she uncovered the Department of Justice investigation into Wichita Public Schools regarding disciplinary policies and co-hosted a series called ‘Positive Connections’ covering unique and uplifting stories across Kansas. With Positive Connections, she won her first award with the Kansas Associations of Broadcasters for her news feature ‘How a daily greeting led to a friendship in Goddard.’ \n\nShe got her start as a morning reporter, fill-in anchor, and fill-in producer with KAAL News in Rochester, Minnesota. There she covered the death of George Floyd, the distribution of the first COVID vaccines by the Mayo Clinic, and the December 2021 storms and tornados that wiped through southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. \n\nSamantha enjoys connecting with new people daily as a reporter and talking with viewers both online and in person. She is excited to tell the stories of those in her home market. This is a goal she’s had since she was in high school where she first became interested in journalism while reporting for the Blazer News Center. KCTV5 is one of the first newsrooms she stepped foot in, so to now be working here as a journalist is a surreal moment. \n\nWhen she isn’t working, you can find her walking her golden retriever, Schroeder (yes, he is named after the Peanuts comic character). Samantha also likes to explore the Kansas City area, go shopping, and spend time with friends and family. \n\nYou can catch Samantha anchoring Saturday mornings and reporting during the week. If you have any story ideas, please reach out by emailing samantha.boring@kctv5.com or contact her through Facebook or X.

Go Bears! After deciding to study journalism with an emphasis in broadcast, I worked my way up the ladder at our student-run news station, News6, from reporter to producer to eventually news director. I also covered various sports as a photographer and reporter for our sports journalism program now known as the Purple and Gray Network, including covering our football team when they won the Southland Conference Championship. I’m a huge sports fan and continue to cheer on the Bears from the PNW. \n\nMy first news job was at KPLC and Fox29 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where I was a reporter and anchor. While there I covered many memorable stories including trying my first crawfish at the annual Crawfish Festival and interviewing then-President Trump during one of his visits to SWLA. \n\nI then moved a few hours north to Shreveport, Louisiana to our sister station KSLA, the CBS affiliate that covered the ArkLaTex. There I kept the community informed as we entered the unknowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the stories of our area’s veterans and active serving military members in our franchise KSLA Salutes, and covered the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Laura. \n\nMy career has brought me to the Pacific Northwest, and now to Kansas City! I cannot be more excited to continue to keep my community informed in the Midwest. I’m from the Natural State so you can find me checking out all the amazing sights and hikes KC has to offer. If you have any recommendations for areas, trails, or restaurants to check out, send them my way!

joined KCTV5 in March 2022.\n\nBorn and raised in Kansas City, Greg has been a lifelong lover of the City of Fountains. Greg graduated in 2015 from the University of Missouri's School of Journalism, at which he spent time as a reporter, producer and anchor for KOMU-TV.\n\nFrom Columbia, Greg moved southwest to the Fort Smith-Fayetteville, Arkansas area and was an assignment manager at KFSM-TV, a CBS affiliate. Just a little more than a year later, he moved back to Columbia, Missouri and worked as the digital executive producer at KRCG-13 for nearly three and a half years.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in February 2020 to take on the role of social media manager at WJLA-TV, working in the nation's capital during the last year of the Trump presidency and the first year of the Biden regime. Two years later, he was thrilled to accept a position back in his hometown, a goal from the moment he started journalism school.\n\nWhen not at work, Greg is likely to be at a Royals game, visiting one of KC's BBQ joints or spending time with family (and there are a lot of them).\n\nIf you have a story idea, feel free to send to

Before coming to Kansas City, he worked at KCTV’s sister station, KOLN, in Lincoln, Nebraska. \n\nHe is originally from Richmond, Virginia and is a proud graduate of Virginia Tech. While at Virginia Tech he studied Journalism and Finance.  \n\nNathan first started his broadcasting career in radio as an on-air producer for ESPN Blacksburg while still in undergrad. While in Lincoln, he reported in the morning for the local CBS station, 10/11 NOW, and co-hosted a two-hour radio show “On the Block w/ Nate and Strick” in the afternoons on 93.7 The Ticket. Nathan still makes guest appearances on both radio stations. \n\nIn his free time, you can find him watching sports, working out or playing golf. He didn’t spend much time in Nebraska but considers himself a Husker enthusiast and can often be found cheering on his Hokies or Huskers. He considers himself a “homer” and has already claimed to be a Chiefs and Royals fan. Nathan grew up playing baseball and played against Royals first baseman, Vinnie Pasquantino, in middle school. He says it’s safe to assume Vinnie is the better athlete. \n\nNathan is a morning guy through and through. He is an advocate for starting the morning off right and is always trying to brighten someone’s day. You can get in touch with Nathan on Twitter or Facebook and let him know what’s making you smile.

Before coming to Kansas City, he worked at KCTV’s sister station, KOLN, in Lincoln, Nebraska. \n\nHe is originally from Richmond, Virginia and is a proud graduate of Virginia Tech. While at Virginia Tech he studied Journalism and Finance.  \n\nNathan first started his broadcasting career in radio as an on-air producer for ESPN Blacksburg while still in undergrad. While in Lincoln, he reported in the morning for the local CBS station, 10/11 NOW, and co-hosted a two-hour radio show “On the Block w/ Nate and Strick” in the afternoons on 93.7 The Ticket. Nathan still makes guest appearances on both radio stations. \n\nIn his free time, you can find him watching sports, working out or playing golf. He didn’t spend much time in Nebraska but considers himself a Husker enthusiast and can often be found cheering on his Hokies or Huskers. He considers himself a “homer” and has already claimed to be a Chiefs and Royals fan. Nathan grew up playing baseball and played against Royals first baseman, Vinnie Pasquantino, in middle school. He says it’s safe to assume Vinnie is the better athlete. \n\nNathan is a morning guy through and through. He is an advocate for starting the morning off right and is always trying to brighten someone’s day. You can get in touch with Nathan on Twitter or Facebook and let him know what’s making you smile.
