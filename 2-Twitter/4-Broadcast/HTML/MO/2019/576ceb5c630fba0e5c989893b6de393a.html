You may remember Justin reporting mornings here at KMOV for more than 5 years. He returned as an anchor and reporter in September 2023.\n\nUpon leaving KMOV, Justin joined KPIX CBS News Bay Area as a magnetic addition to the morning team in San Francisco. He was part of launching the 5-hour “Morning Edition” newscasts where he anchored and reported. With a captivating on-screen presence, Justin etched his path as the unyielding lead morning reporter captivating viewers with live breaking news reports. Justin’s career has landed his live reporting on CNN, CBS This Morning, and HLN. His grit led him to being nominated for an Emmy for his reporting while working in the Bay Area. He also served on the Board of Governors for the San Francisco/Northern California EMMY chapter for nearly 2 years.\n\nJustin's storytelling prowess unfolded in the heartlands of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. There, he didn't just report stories; he became the advocate for those whose voices were drowned by adversity. Justin spent two years fearlessly uncovering tales that echoed across Iowa. In 2014, after the tragic death of a child who was swept away in a storm drain during major flooding, people wanted state leaders to cover the drains. With Justin's dogged and unwavering determination, state leaders in Iowa added covers over storm drains. \n\nJustin's journey through the world of journalism began in Kansas City, Missouri, where he cut his teeth as a morning producer and fill-in assignment desk editor. He also graced Kirksville, Missouri, as the weekend evening anchor, adding diverse hues to his journalistic palette.\n\nWith over 12 years of TV experience under his belt, Justin's heart now beats for the vibrancy of St. Louis. It's a dream come true, and he's ready to embrace it all. Beyond the screen, Justin is more than a journalist; he's a force for change. He mentors, he advocates, he stands for the truth. He's a church boy, a brunch aficionado, and an outdoor adventurer.\n\nIf you cross paths with Justin across St. Louis, don't hesitate to say hello! Engage with him, share a conversation, and witness what makes him a champion in wanting the typically unheard voices to be heard.","slug":"","instagram":"@Justin_EAndrews","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kmov","last_updated_date":"2023-12-06T17:31:28.229Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:50:56.398Z","description":{"basic":"The

During her time at WSAZ, Kimberly embodied the station's \"Making a Difference\" brand by helping viewers obtain landline phone access in rural areas, assisting in jumpstarting construction on treacherous roads and highlighting the struggles of those on Charleston's West Side during a nearly month-long natural gas outage at the start of winter 2023. \n\nKimberly is no stranger to the Midwest. She started her reporting career at our sister station, WIBW in Topeka, Kansas days into the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While in Kansas, Kimberly's reporting on a small town’s monthly gas bill during a cold snap prompted swift movement in the legislature to provide utility bill relief to more than 170 towns across the state.\n\nA graduate of Hofstra University, she credits the university’s radio station for emphasizing the importance of storytelling. \n\nKimberly is a proud Philadelphia native. When not working, you can find her scrapbooking, cheering on Philly sports or checking out local eateries.

There, he worked his way through multiple roles including production assistant, photographer, multimedia journalist, investigative reporter, and news anchor. Joe also occasionally anchored hourly radio news updates for 93.9 The Eagle FM and other properties of Zimmer Radio & Marketing Group.\n\nIn 2015, Joe earned a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Missouri, emphasizing study in convergence and emerging media. He also earned a certificate in multicultural studies at Mizzou. In 2019, Joe was appointed an adjunct faculty member at the prestigious Missouri School of Journalism, teaching applied projects for journalism and strategic communication. He returned to that teaching role in 2024. Joe is a member of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), the National Association of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ).\n\nIn a brief stint outside the Midwest, Joe covered education, politics, and breaking news in Jacksonville, Florida for News4JAX (WJXT) between 2020 and 2023. He was a frequent guest on WJCT News' ‘First Coast Connect’ Friday Media Round Table, offering analysis and commentary on the week's top stories. His work at News4JAX earned a Regional Emmy Award nomination in the Suncoast Region and went on to be featured in the Academy Award-nominated documentary short film, ‘The ABCs of Book Banning.’ \n\nJoe’s investigative and breaking news reporting also yielded multiple accolades from the Missouri Broadcasters Association, the Kansas City Press Club, and the Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-03-30T15:16:42.478Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:29:04.899Z","description":{"basic":"Missourians

Murrow award, and a Missouri Broadcasters Association award.\n\nNotably Susan's reporting on a deadly tornado that struck an Amazon warehouse uncovered questions about the building's structural integrity, prompted changes in city building inspections, and led to calls for safety improvements at state and national levels. This, in turn, resulted in the passage of state legislation aimed at enhancing warehouse safety.\n\nHer in-depth reporting on crime and corruption has resulted in changes to city, county, and state policies.\n\nPrior to joining KMOV, Susan was the lead investigative reporter at KARK-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her investigation exposed the increasing use of PIT maneuvers by Arkansas State Police, which sometimes ended in deadly wrecks. Her work received international attention and instigated changes within the department, so the maneuvers now conform with deadly use of force policies.\n\nSusan's career started in Lansing, Michigan, where she was an anchor and reporter at WILX-TV.

He strives to build genuine relationships with those he meets. \nHe previously worked as a reporter and anchor in Cedar Rapids at KGAN. There he covered natural disasters from a derecho to tornadoes, the Derek Chauvin murder trial, presidents and presidential hopefuls, and the first MLB Field of Dreams game in Dyersville. He also spent five-and-a-half years in Quincy, Illinois where he served as evening anchor and reporter.  \n\nDavid won an Edward R. Murrow for his in-depth piece \"When Kids Find Guns” in 2019. David's reporting has also garnered first-place wins in Illinois and Iowa for hard news, sports, and feature reporting. He also earned Emmy nominations in 2019 and 2021.\n\nDavid attended Chaminade College Preparatory for middle school and high school. He is a proud Lindenwood University Alumnus. \n\nDavid loves spending time with his wife Mandy, family, and friends.

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:
