I remember reading the newspaper in the 3rd grade.   At the age of 10, I anxiously watched for t-v news reports from the war in Vietnam.   By the time I was in high school, I was truly addicted to learning as much as I could about what was going on in the world around me.   So, no great surprise to my parents when I graduated college with a Bachelors degree in TV News.   I attended a Christian school, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina.    \n\nShortly after graduation, I started my career at KODE-TV  in Joplin, Missouri.   I began as a general assignment t-v news reporter and anchored the 5-minute \"local cut-in\" newscasts during Good Morning America.\"   Soon more opportunities to anchor came up.   I continued to report, but also began co-anchoring the evening newscasts.  I spent four years at KODE and learned so much.   I had no idea how much more I had to learn until I arrived at KY3 in 1984.\n\nI came to KY3 as an evening anchor, but spent more of my time in the field as a general assignment reporter.   Those assignments took me everywhere you can imagine.  From Green Forest, Arkansas, on environmental issues to Atlanta, Georgia, for the 1988 Democratic National Convention.  That was the first time local t-v stations converged on such a national event, because mobile satellite trucks had become the new cutting edge tool, giving news reporters the ability to go live from anywhere in the country.   We used that satellite truck in our viewing area almost everyday.    Before the satellite truck, our live reporting was limited by technology, we had to stay close to our station and tower.    But by the late 1980's we were live on the scene of every story you can imagine and in the most remote parts of our viewing area.  Satellite trucks were a game changer.\n\nBut even at that time, whispers of what was coming would change TV news coverage even more.  We scoffed when we saw a movie in the 1990's, showing a reporter with a backpack that enabled her to go live from the middle of nowhere.   Today all of our news reporters have that kind of back pack.   What used to take a satellite truck, an engineer, a photographer, and a reporter to deliver a live report... now takes one person.  Today our reporters gather the information, write their stories, shoot and edit their own interviews and video, and set up their own camera, before stepping in front of it and delivering their live report from anywhere in the Ozarks.  \n\nLike most TV news reporters, I had planned to move on to bigger t-v stations in larger cities as my career progressed.    I was used to traveling.  Growing up, my family lived in more than a dozen different places across the country....from Michigan to Texas...from Indiana to Oregon.  But we always came \"home\" to Springfield.  I graduated high school from Christian Schools of Springfield.          \n\nMy first job at the age of 17 was at the A&W at the Battlefield Mall, in Springfield.  I grew up watching KY3, and my parents had finally settled down in the area.    So the personal pull to stay in Springfield was strong, but it was KY3, itself that kept me here.  At every turn, KY3 has stayed ahead of the curve in broadcast news.   From technology to techniques in news gathering, the station has been a leader in television news.  Just like our viewers, I didn't have to move away to find the very best resources available for news gathering.  KY3 brought them here.  \n\nIt's been 39 years now since I came home to KY3.    I was able to spend invaluable time with my parents, who are now together again in heaven.  I've been able to be with my brothers and sister, also here in the Ozarks...and watch my 12 nieces and nephews grow up and have kids of their own.   Then in 1997, I met the love of my life here.  I married Randy Rose in 1998, had three precious step-children...and now three grandchildren.      \n\nI've been anchoring the evening news for decades now.    I still love coming into your homes to tell you what's going on in the world...and your neighborhoods.   There's always something new to report, maybe that's why I've never tired of being in one place for so long.
