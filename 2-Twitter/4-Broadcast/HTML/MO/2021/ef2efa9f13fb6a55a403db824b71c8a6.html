During her time at WSAZ, Kimberly embodied the station's \"Making a Difference\" brand by helping viewers obtain landline phone access in rural areas, assisting in jumpstarting construction on treacherous roads and highlighting the struggles of those on Charleston's West Side during a nearly month-long natural gas outage at the start of winter 2023. \n\nKimberly is no stranger to the Midwest. She started her reporting career at our sister station, WIBW in Topeka, Kansas days into the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While in Kansas, Kimberly's reporting on a small town’s monthly gas bill during a cold snap prompted swift movement in the legislature to provide utility bill relief to more than 170 towns across the state.\n\nA graduate of Hofstra University, she credits the university’s radio station for emphasizing the importance of storytelling. \n\nKimberly is a proud Philadelphia native.

the Action News 5 in May 2022.\n\nHer passion for broadcast journalism started at a young age in middle school as a school anchor, reading the morning news announcements.\n\nShe followed it from her hometown in Lakeland, Florida, to Baltimore, Maryland, where she received her degree in Multimedia Journalism from Morgan State University (Go Bears!).\n\nAfter graduation in December 2018, Stephanie took her first on-air job as a morning anchor in Alpena, Michigan, where she edited, produced, and anchored her show at WBKB News.\n\nA year later, Stephanie traded in her snow gear for cowboy boots and made the move to Odessa, Texas, to join CBS7, the #1 station in West Texas.\n\nWhen she's not on-air, you'll probably catch her out enjoying a day of shopping, watching a movie, cooking, dancing, or spending time with her family.\n\nIf you see her out and about, please say hello!\nYou can connect with Stephanie on Facebook at @Stephaniedotv or email story ideas to
