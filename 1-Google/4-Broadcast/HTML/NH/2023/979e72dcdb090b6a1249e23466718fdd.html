<p>The clinics began in July 2021 with one mobile vaccination van, and eventually increased to seven teams. Over 700 vaccination clinics were hosted and 37 thousand doses were administered through the program.</p>
<p>The vaccine and booster doses are still available through provider offices, urgent care centers and pharmacies.</p>
<p>The homebased program resumed in October and provided more than 2,100 doses to residents. Homebound individuals who need a COVID-19 vaccine or booster can still reach out to their local Visiting Nurses Association.</p>

Burdick said he hopes this is a good sign but also understands how quickly things could turn around, especially since it&#8217;s only been a few days since the Super Bowl. He noted that only three staff members tested positive as well, which is another good sign that community spread is weakening. The school also started testing out of isolation or quarantine on day six this week. Of the 38 cases who could test out, 12 students tested negative, while three were still testing positive. As for the others, he said school officials aren&#8217;t sure if they were still symptomatic or simply didn&#8217;t see the email regarding the change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile good news came out of SAU 29 as well as Superintendent Robb Malay shared a graph showing a significant decline in cases in the past two weeks, but did not provide any further details.</p>

<p>Things may be returning to the new normal at Maplewood Nursing Home. After several weeks of a bit of a spike in COVID-19 cases in staff and residents, things have begun to quiet down at the facility and staff members that were out are returning to work. According to a news release Monday, one support worker who worked at the end of last week took an at home COVID test and came up positive, but other than that County Administrator Chris Coates says more and more staff are returning from either illness or household impacts, which he is hoping is an indicator that the variant may have peaked in the nursing home&#8217;s community.</p>
<p>Coates also said that the facility has several boxes of the blue surgical masks that are set to expire in March, so those are being kept at the main entrance for folks to take home with them.</p>
