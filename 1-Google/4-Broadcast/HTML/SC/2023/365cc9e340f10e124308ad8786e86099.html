Arinder is a reporter and anchor for FOX Carolina.","longBio":"Anna Arinder is a reporter and the anchor for the weekend news on FOX Carolina News. She joined the FOX Carolina team in May 2022.\nShe is a native of the Carolinas, born in Charlotte and graduating from East Carolina University. She previously reported for a TV station in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nBefore starting my journalism career, I worked at Disney World as a performer for about 9 months. Then I took a job as an overnight producer at Spectrum in Charlotte, NC from 2017-2020. In 2020 I moved to Jackson, MS where I worked as the morning reporter, then nightside reporter, then dayside reporter. I also fill-in anchored on the weekends/weekday mornings/nights.\n\nI think the most memorable story I covered was Tim Tebow wishing a 105-year-old woman a happy birthday. I was able to help make her wish come true and I did not know at the time of the story that this would be her last birthday. After covering an initial story on Corabell Edison, Tebow's assistant reached out to me and said they would love to make her wish come true. They recorded a video wishing her a happy birthday and thanking her for all that she had given to the world. Watching her light up for just that moment and seeing her hold on to his biography that she used to read while watching it was so special. She is someone I will always remember. \n\nOn the weekends, I love to: Thrift, take my 3 dogs to the dog park, get my nails done, volunteer at church, explore the city with my husband, spend time with my family, watch Netflix with my hubby, work in the garden.  \nMy favorite movie is: How to lose a guy in 10 days and Legally Blonde\nMy favorite kind of music is: I love musicals but I also love country music\nMy favorite food is: Mexican tacos/burritos/ guacamole, chips and salsa-- I could eat Mexican for every meal. I also love really love sushi!\n\nHidden talents? Yes, I can do voice impressions. It's something that I am really embarrassed that I'm good at.\nHobbies? Gardening and flipping thrift finds. I love going thrifting and finding new clothes to style, collecting old records, and vintage pieces to put around my home.\nPets? Yes, I have 3.

It is not a sight anyone should have to witness, let alone a child. It was apparent the child was still processing what happened, but she spoke out in hopes it would bring change. The impact of the opioid epidemic stretched far and wide. I will never forget that story and I hope the viewers who watched it won’t either.

She appears weekdays on The Morning News from 4:30 a.m. – 9 a.m.\n\nMargaret-Ann joined the FOX Carolina news team on June 26, 2019.\n\nShe is from Charleston, SC, graduated from the University of South Carolina, and is moving to the Upstate from Jackson, MS.\n\nAbout Margaret-Ann’s career: I always knew I wanted to be a journalist, but it was during my internship at WSB-TV in Atlanta where I truly fell in love with the art of storytelling. Barely out of College, I took a weekend reporting job with WJBF in Augusta, GA. During my two years there, I covered a variety of stories focusing on the Aiken, South Carolina area. I eventually started filling in on the anchor desk and worked my way up to reporting Monday through Friday. After my two years in Augusta, I was ready to take on more of a leadership role as an anchor. I had never even traveled through Jackson, Mississippi, but when WJTV offered me the weekend morning anchor position, I knew it was time to leave my comfort zone. Without knowing a soul, I packed up and move to the hospitality state, and the community lived up to their reputation. From 2016 to 2019 I created a home away from home and found my own little Mississippi family. After less than two years anchoring on the weekends, I was promoted to the Monday through Friday 4 PM anchor. While I love the Magnolia state and the lifelong friends I made there, I knew it was time to come on back home. I am beyond excited to be working in my home state and I’m thrilled to be able to tell your stories. I look forward to serving this community and becoming your trusted source for all things news.\n\nOn the weekends: I love to get together with friends and visit new areas and restaurants around town. I also love to travel.\n\nMy favorite movie is: Grease, I can sing the entire soundtrack!\n\nMy favorite kind of music is: Anything I can dance to!\n\nMy favorite food is: Fresh seafood.\n\nHidden talents: I can cook. That doesn’t mean I like to, but I can. I also do a great Cher impression, or Ronnie Dunn, depending on who you ask.\n\nHobbies: Exploring new places and experiencing new things. I love interacting with the community and meeting new people. You can usually find me out and about around town!\n\nPets: My sweet Tabby cat named Tilly. I rescued her from the Mississippi Animal Rescue League after seeing her precious face while reporting on a story at the Shelter.\n\nMost memorable story: I’ve had the opportunity to cover many memorable stories over the last 5 years. I’ve been trusted to tell other people’s stories, some of tragedy, others of triumph, but there is one that is very close to my heart. I remember the morning of June 17, 2015. I woke up to dozens of frantic texts from friends and family members, wondering if I had heard about the tragedy in my hometown of Charleston, SC. A quick Google search would reveal the horrific events that unfolded as I slept that night. A person opened fire inside of Mother Emanuel AME Church, killing 9 churchgoers, sending the community and the nation, into mourning. In the coming days I was sent to Charleston, to cover the funeral of SC Senator Clementa Pinckney. I’ll never forget the scene in downtown Charleston when I arrived. The streets were blocked off and people had set up ‘prayer tents’ in the middle of the street. Volunteers handed out cold water and strangers held each other and cried together. The amount of love pouring out of the community was something I’ll never forget. To see an entire city turn to love, when they could have easily turned to hate, is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"whns","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":6,"last_updated_date":"2022-09-15T15:17:40.871Z","website_url":"/authors/margaret-ann-carter/","headlines":{"basic":"Margaret-Ann Carter"},"description":{"basic":"Margaret-Ann Carter co-anchors The Morning News on FOX Carolina."},"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"Margaret-Ann.Carter@foxcarolina.com"},{"site":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/margaretanncartertv"},{"site":"twitter","url":"MargaretAnnOnTV"}],"type":"author","custom_gray_biovideouuid":"","hasVideoCenterVideo":false,"promo_items":{"basic":{"type":"image","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/068e2d5e-353e-462e-b63f-1c165dc5c0ca.jpg","auth":{"3":"1d50da794cdf7a75a10d67d55b1773ca9e9130b2e2f9d275b4f4ecce49ef423b"}}},"dataTransformedAt":"2024-05-31T00:29:08.351Z"},{"_id":"brookley-cromer","firstName":"Brookley","lastName":"Cromer","byline":"Brookley Cromer","role":"Reporter, FOX Carolina News","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/89c12f0a-d3dd-4b7c-9f08-8966c357ebe5.jpg","email":"Brookley.Cromer@foxcarolina.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/brookleyfoxcarolina","twitter":"BrookleyCromer","bio_page":"/authors/brookley-cromer/","bio":"Brookley Cromer is a reporter for FOX Carolina.","longBio":"Brookley Cromer is a reporter for FOX Carolina.

She studied broadcast journalism at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, FL. \n\nShe got her start in news in her hometown, a top 20 market back in 2012 at WESH 2 News. While there she worked primarily as an overnight Associate Producer, writing lots of scripts for Producers and rolling teleprompter in studio for the Anchors to read. \n\nIn 2014, she climbed up the news ladder, still behind the scenes, this time working as a producer. She crafted the two and a half hour-long morning show for WTVM News in Columbus, Ga. While there, Ashley was eventually put in position to train incoming producers and those at the station who wanted to transition into a producer role.\n\nIn 2016, Ashley climbed up the news ladder again. She got her first professional, on-air job at WRBL News, also in Columbus, Ga. Ashley started out working as the morning \"one-man band\" reporter. This means, Ashley came up with her stories, she shot the video for them, edited the video, posted to web and social, etc. Ashley had to do this for minimum two stories a day. In this role, the most stories Ashley nailed in a day...was four. Two of them were breaking news. This station truly worked to make Ashley a strong journalist who can wear many hats. In 2017, she became the Weekend Anchor/Producer. This means she sat on the desk to anchor the show she crafted. In this role, her tasks also included getting breaking news on the air, sometimes while on the desk. This means confirming tips with official sources, writing scripts for closed captioning, putting in graphics, transitions, etc. in scripts for showcase, sending push alerts, writing web scripts, etc., all while making sure the show started and ended on time.\n\nIn November of 2018, Ashley got her first Morning Main Anchor role in Savannah at WJCL News. There, with the help of managers, Ashley was able to find her anchor-style. She was also put in a position to coach and train other morning show team members on manager's expectations for shows. \n\nIn December of 2021, Ashley moved to Greenville, SC to join The Fox Carolina team. \n\nOn the weekends: \"In the summer, I love all things beach and pool. In general on the weekends, I like to travel.\"\n\nMy favorite movie: \"There's too many to name!

She joined the team in July of 2023.\n\nBefore moving to the Upstate, Dana lived in the birthplace of Mardi Gras, Mobile, Alabama, for five years. At WKRG, Dana started as an evening reporter and ended as the station's weekend anchor. Along with anchoring the weekends, Dana would report on investigative stories, film highlights for Friday Night Football, as well as help with the station's traffic reports. While in the Port City, Dana also reported on hurricanes. Along with the storms on her part of the Gulf Coast, she went to Panama City following the devastation of Hurrican Michael, and was in Lake Charles, Louisiana as Hurricane Laura ripped through the area. \n\nDana has also anchored and reported for stations in Northwest Arkansas and West Texas. In Texas, she got the opportunity to report on some amazing experiences like riding in the Goodyear Blimp and attending the Sweetwater Rattlesnake Roundup. In Northwest Arkansas, Dana reported on a historic 100-year flood, but also got to report on events like Arkansas Razorback games and Bikes, Blues, and Barbecues (a motorcycle rally).\n\nDana's last name may be Winter, but she's from the Sunshine State, Florida. She grew up between Orlando and Tampa and knew she wanted to be a journalist since she was in middle school and took an assignment about \"what you want to be when you grow up\" to heart. From that day, she decided to do everything she could to be a great storyteller. She auditioned into the Lois Cowels Harrison School for the Visual and Performing Arts where she majored in Musical Theatre. Dana continued to stay in Florida through college and attended the University of Florida in Gainesville. While in college she also spent 26.2 hours standing in a gym every year as a dancer for the Children's Miracle Networks' Dance Marathon, a program that raises millions of dollars to help kids at Shands Hospital. \n\nWhen asked to pick a favorite story, Dana took a long time, but couldn't narrow it down to just on story. She loves telling stories that bring people together, help others in their time of need, and change the world for the better. \n\nOn the weekends, Dana spends most of her time with her husband, Eric, and their three dogs: Rocky, Pepper, and London. They'll go to the park, explore the area, but also take some time for some video games on the Nintendo Switch. Dana doesn't have a favorite movie, but she does have a favorite musical, Legally Blonde the Musical. While she does sing a lot of showtunes, Dana has a strong love for almost all kinds of music.

He knew he wanted to be a meteorologist at an early age, and he would often hand draw his own weather maps, giving the forecast to his family and neighbors. After high school, Mark attended the University of North Carolina in Asheville and graduated with a bachelor's degree in atmospheric sciences. \n\nMark began his career as a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Columbia, SC.  After two years in the NWS, Mark’s career path shifted to broadcast meteorology when he began working at WIS-TV in Columbia. From Columbia, Mark moved to Knoxville, TN and worked for 6 years as a morning meteorologist at WBIR-TV. In 2001, his broadcast meteorology career brought him to the Upstate. \nMark has covered everything from ice storms to hurricanes and everything in between while living in the Upstate.  \n\nAfter the death of a close friend who was waiting for an organ transplant, Mark changed his career path in 2007. For the next 16 years, he worked in media and public relations for the organ, eye and tissue donation field. Mark is still an advocate for the Donate Life community, but now works full time in the tourism marketing field. \n\nBecause of his love of weather, Mark never completely left the broadcast meteorology field. He began freelancing in 2007 as a fill-in meteorologist in Charlotte, NC. In the years since, Mark has continued freelancing not only at stations in Charlotte, but also Columbia and here in the Upstate. He has been a member of the FOX Carolina Weather Team since 2008. \n\nThe Fun Stuff\nOn the weekends, I spend much of my time hiking the beautiful trails in the area while chasing waterfalls and enjoying the views from many of our high peaks. \nMy favorite kind of music is: Pop/Rock \nMy favorite food is: A toss-up between Rotisserie Chicken and Pizza\nHobbies: Researching interesting places to explore, traveling, collecting magnets from new places visited, photography and working out. \nMost Memorable Story:  Covering Hurricane Frances in 2004 is my most memorable story because I was able to cover this historic storm from the air, along flooded rivers and in the weather center. As this intense Category 3 Hurricane moved into the Bahamas, I was able to fly with the Air Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron known as the \"Hurricane Hunters\". Our flight was in the air for over 10 hours and flew through the storm’s eye numerous times. After we landed in Biloxi, MS, and before Frances made landfall in the US, I rushed back to South Carolina, continuing severe weather coverage from the weather center. Frances spawned over 100 tornadoes from Florida to Virginia and produced record amounts of rainfall in many areas. When major flooding developed in Western North Carolina, I then moved to the field to do live reports showing the massive impacts of this system on our communities and the people in them. This is truly an experience I will never forget.

I learned an incredible amount and even got to host my own segment as a reporter on the ESPYs red carpet before accepting a full-time job at the \"worldwide leader in sports\" in Bristol, CT. During my two years there I produced highlights of everything from golf, basketball and football to roller derby and The Westminster Dog Show. \n\nI would never be able to forgive myself if I didn't give my on-air dream a chance, so I left ESPN, drove across the country in my 1993 Pontiac Bonneville and became the Sports Director at KTWO in Casper, WY. I gained a love for rodeo, the University of Wyoming Cowboys, and was humbled to receive a 50-car parade from the people in town on my last day of work. No sports jobs were hiring during the start of the pandemic, so I switched it up and became the Evening News Anchor at KTVL in Medford, OR where I also hosted our Friday night high school football and basketball shows for three years. Now, I'm ecstatic to be back covering sports full time for Fox Carolina especially with the enthusiasm level for sports here. \n\nThe career means even more to me because I am following in my dad, Mike Gemei's, footsteps. In the late 70s and early 80s, he was a sportscaster where I went to college in Scranton, PA and decades later he called the play-by-play from the sidelines of my own games from third grade through high school. That made me think this was a normal job to have and also showed me the impact it can have on adding flavor, enjoyment and context to sports. \n\nI believe there are so many life lessons to be taught, learned and revealed through sports and I'm excited to share those stories with our audience along with celebrating all the big-time games and events.  \n\nThe Fun Stuff\nOn the weekends, I love to: Enjoy downtown Greenville & Asheville, attend a body of water, play golf, hang with friends\nMy favorite movie is: Glory Road\nMy favorite kind of music is: Hip-Hop, Rap, R&B\nMy favorite food is: Italian, Mexican, sushi \nHidden talents: Can touch my nose with my tongue \nHobbies: Sports Card collecting, guitar playing\nPets: Cat named Vivica (A.
