Because it could be somebody that was at the house during the death. You know, we don&#x27;t know,&quot; said Ivory Henry, Jr.</p><p>The family said they can&#x27;t understand why anyone would want Henry dead. They said he bothered no one and kept to himself.</p><h2><a href="http://wpde.com/news/local/family-of-man-killed-at-florence-restaurant-wonders-who-wanted-him-dead" target="_blank" class="themeColorForLinks">Related - Family of man killed at Florence restaurant wonders who wanted him dead</a></h2><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t have no clue whatsoever. He don&#x27;t hang with nobody. He always quiet,&quot; said Tony Felder, Henry&#x27;s brother.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s been hard. You know everyday you open up your eyes. You&#x27;re thinking about it. It&#x27;ll never be the same no more,&quot; said Kimbery Felder, Henry&#x27;s sister.</p><p>Henry&#x27;s wife said the past year has been like a nightmare.</p><p>She said she never imagined she would be a widow at 26 years old and left to raise her four small children as a single parent.</p><p>&quot;We grew up together. Living and he&#x27;s not here, it&#x27;s not right. It hurts a lot. I just really want justice. And that&#x27;s the only thing I can ask for,&quot; Aneglica Henry said.</p><p>Henry said she feels her road to justice is being blocked by the Florence County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.</p><p>She added investigators are not returning phone calls, emails or text messages.</p><p>&quot;I feel like my husband is just forgotten about, I do,&quot; said Henry.</p><p>Florence County Sheriff&#x27;s Office Major Michael Nunn said deputies have been diligently working the case from day one and they&#x27;ve been following up on every lead in the case.</p><p>&quot;The case is continuing to be investigated. As we receive tips we follow up on them. If there&#x27;s something that we need to touch base with the family on for clarification or additional information. We certainly do that. But not every lead will result in contact with the family. But they can rest assured that the investigation is ongoing,&quot; explained Nunn.</p><p>The Henry family said they&#x27;re praying the case is solved and soon.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what to think. I&#x27;m still looking for some closure. Hopefully this will refresh somebody&#x27;s memories and hopefully somebody will come forward with something,&quot; said Henry.</p><p>Anyone with information is asked to call the Florence County Sheriff&#x27;s Office at 843-665-2121.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="js-Taboola-Container-0" class="index-module_taboola__RgGF index-module_shadow__Mt9R"></div><div
