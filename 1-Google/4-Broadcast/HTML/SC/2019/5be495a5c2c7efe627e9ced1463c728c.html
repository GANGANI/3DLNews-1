The SCBA Masters Award recognizes lifetime achievement of on-air broadcasters who have made significant contributions to broadcasting in the state and who personify high broadcast industry standards within their communities. The man who signed on WCSC-TV in 1953, Charlie Hall, won the same honor in 1994.</p><p class="text | article-text">Then, in September 2018, Chard and Sharpe became the first anchor team to be inducted into the Silver Circle. The honor, from the Southeast Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, is one of the chapter's most prestigious awards recognizing a lifetime of dedication to the television industry.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Debi Chard and Bill Sharpe were inducted into the South Carolina Broadcasters Association..." loading="lazy" src="https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KTBFZOGNARBTLOTU4NV4FIU3LI.jpg?auth=501f2d3c756fdd9f3a1797f561068b2a73820814b90c6a425abe5e460440641c&amp;width=980&amp;height=1092&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="1092" srcSet="https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KTBFZOGNARBTLOTU4NV4FIU3LI.jpg?auth=501f2d3c756fdd9f3a1797f561068b2a73820814b90c6a425abe5e460440641c&amp;width=540&amp;height=601&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KTBFZOGNARBTLOTU4NV4FIU3LI.jpg?auth=501f2d3c756fdd9f3a1797f561068b2a73820814b90c6a425abe5e460440641c&amp;width=720&amp;height=802&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KTBFZOGNARBTLOTU4NV4FIU3LI.jpg?auth=501f2d3c756fdd9f3a1797f561068b2a73820814b90c6a425abe5e460440641c&amp;width=980&amp;height=1092&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KTBFZOGNARBTLOTU4NV4FIU3LI.jpg?auth=501f2d3c756fdd9f3a1797f561068b2a73820814b90c6a425abe5e460440641c&amp;width=1300&amp;height=1448&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Debi Chard and Bill Sharpe were inducted into the South Carolina Broadcasters Association Silver Circle.

But over the airwaves, it was a different story.</p><p class="text | article-text">“I had appeared on television when I was in kindergarten, believe it or not, and several times through my childhood dancing as a performer,” she remembered. “And then in high school I was in a ballet company.”</p><p class="text | article-text">But there were few women in broadcast journalism by the time she reached college.</p><p class="text | article-text">“But they encouraged us, and we worked alongside our male students, and it ended up as I graduated that they were looking for women. However, I moved to the South and I was told by one general manager, ‘We have women behind the cameras and women emptying trash can, but we don’t have women on the air,” Chard said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Radio was already beginning to change that.

A monitor in the studio was not tuned properly and there was no floor director in the studio to give her a cue.</p><p class="text | article-text">“When it came time to do the news, there was a voice on the other side of the wall yelling, ‘Go! Go!’” she said. “And it gets funnier, because the way they cued you to go to weather — you did 20 to 30 seconds of weather then you wrapped up — when you got the cue, they kicked the door open to the studio. So that was the morning news cut-in back in the day.”</p><p class="text | article-text">After about three years of working six days per week, she made the move to television full-time.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">In more than four decades of broadcasting, she witnessed technology transform the journalism industry.
