Leo is a member of the American Meteorological Society and holds the Society's prestigious Certified Broadcast Meteorologist (CBM) designation. The CBM Seal is the highest designation awarded by the American Meteorological Society \"The Society's Certified Broadcast Meteorologist designation clearly recognizes that the holders have the educational background and have been tested in their knowledge and communication of the sciences needed to be an effective broadcast meteorologist,\" said AMS Executive Director Keith Seitter. \"The general public can have added confidence in the quality and reliability of weather presentations made by broadcast meteorologists approved by the Society.\"\n\nBeing a meteorologist was a childhood dream for Leo. In 1978, he experienced the \"Storm of the Century\" at the early age of five. Its blistering winds and blanketing snow invoked his everlasting passion for the weather, which he enthusiastically shares with children today through his frequent visits to various local schools.\n\nDuring his free time he loves watching and playing Ice Hockey.
