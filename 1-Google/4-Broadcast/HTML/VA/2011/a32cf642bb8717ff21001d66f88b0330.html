She started her career as a production assistant. While she was there, she spent two years learning different areas of the newsroom, but her heart was led to producing and reporting.\n\nHer next newsroom was not too far from her first. She became a full-time Associate Producer at WTKR in Norfolk. She quickly worked her way up into a producer role, where she was able to build impactful newscasts, which involved stories her community were most interested in. \n\nShantel eventually made her way to Richmond in the fall of 2022 as a producer and multi-media journalist. She enjoys getting to know the community and sharing the stories that matter most to the community.\n\nSince she’s been here, her heart has leaped for the beauty of the city. Her favorite parts are the history, artistic culture, and of course the food. “Richmond has some amazing food places!” She says.\n\nIn her free time, Shantel enjoys spending time with family and close friends, traveling, going to the beach, museums and watching Law and Order. Shantel is excited to be in Richmond and looks forward to learning more about the rich culture of the area.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east.

A native of Richmond, she is thrilled to be reporting in her hometown.\n \nSarah started her career writing, producing and reporting for digital at CNN International in Hong Kong. In her seven years there, she covered a wide range of stories from global business news to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement,\" the search for missing flight MH370, Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi in the Arab Spring uprising, which earned her a Peabody Award for CNN team coverage.\n \nFrom Hong Kong, Sarah relocated to Miami and spent time at WFOR-CBS4. Her writing and reporting on the Pulse Nightclub shooting earned an Emmy for team breaking news coverage. After that, she joined Fox News Network and NBC Network News as a freelance field producer. She racked up a lot of air miles in those positions: covering hurricanes and tornados, the Parkland school shooting massacre, politics and more. \nFor NBC’s Today Show and Nightly News, she tracked python hunters in the Florida Everglades, cruised with Bonnie Tyler as she performed her hit single “Total Eclipse of the Heart” during a real total solar eclipse, spent time with Simone Biles in her Texas practice gym and sat in the courtroom for the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh.\n \nSarah has a broadcast journalism degree from The University of South Carolina (Go Gamecocks!) and a master’s degree in journalism from The University of Hong Kong.\n \nShe enjoys traveling, spending time with her family and exploring Richmond.

She became a full-time Associate Producer at WTKR in Norfolk. She quickly worked her way up into a producer role, where she was able to build impactful newscasts, which involved stories her community were most interested in. \n\nShantel eventually made her way to Richmond in the fall of 2022 as a producer and multi-media journalist. She enjoys getting to know the community and sharing the stories that matter most to the community.\n\nSince she’s been here, her heart has leaped for the beauty of the city. Her favorite parts are the history, artistic culture, and of course the food. “Richmond has some amazing food places!” She says.\n\nIn her free time, Shantel enjoys spending time with family and close friends, traveling, going to the beach, museums and watching Law and Order.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:51:28.268Z","location":"Roanoke VA","custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T17:10:40.218Z","description":{"basic":"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are tied (42%-42%) in a head-to-head matchup in Virginia, according to this poll."},"headlines":{"basic":"Roanoke College Poll indicates tie between Biden and Trump","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A","additional_properties":{"countryId":227,"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/jHrsjL8pCEIVlV0F0wzPMuYszik=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_job_identifier":"SPANWX501","iptc_source":"AP","iptc_title":"STF","keywords":[""],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"AP24136471859510.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A.jpg","owner":"marcelo@telemundoatlanta.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/jHrsjL8pCEIVlV0F0wzPMuYszik=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/jHrsjL8pCEIVlV0F0wzPMuYszik=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2024-05-02T22:03:09Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/Gds607Z2_0XOSJeszxg5KQhsKPY=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/WCEPZ7W6VFF3PCKA27BRVWPT4A.jpg","usage_instructions":"PHOTOS BY ALEX BRANDON, LEFT, AND MORRY GASH; COMBINATION PHOTO","version":0,"template_id":32},"address":{"locality":"Wilmington","region":"NC","country_name":"USA"},"alt_text":"Biden y Trump acuerdan dos debates, en junio y septiembre","auth":{"3":"6f8729f432ecc386b59855ec5d62bb61a31402f6853ad0458fcf5d56f4a5d28d"},"caption":"","copyright":"Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A native of Richmond, she is thrilled to be reporting in her hometown.\n \nSarah started her career writing, producing and reporting for digital at CNN International in Hong Kong. In her seven years there, she covered a wide range of stories from global business news to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy \"Umbrella Movement,\" the search for missing flight MH370, Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi in the Arab Spring uprising, which earned her a Peabody Award for CNN team coverage.\n \nFrom Hong Kong, Sarah relocated to Miami and spent time at WFOR-CBS4. Her writing and reporting on the Pulse Nightclub shooting earned an Emmy for team breaking news coverage. After that, she joined Fox News Network and NBC Network News as a freelance field producer. She racked up a lot of air miles in those positions: covering hurricanes and tornados, the Parkland school shooting massacre, politics and more. \nFor NBC’s Today Show and Nightly News, she tracked python hunters in the Florida Everglades, cruised with Bonnie Tyler as she performed her hit single “Total Eclipse of the Heart” during a real total solar eclipse, spent time with Simone Biles in her Texas practice gym and sat in the courtroom for the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh.\n \nSarah has a broadcast journalism degree from The University of South Carolina (Go Gamecocks!) and a master’s degree in journalism from The University of Hong Kong.\n \nShe enjoys traveling, spending time with her family and exploring Richmond.
