Lydia also grew up in the area.\n\nHer notable coverage includes the Josh Duggar child pornography trial, an exclusive interview with an Arkansan charged in the U.S. Capitol riots, and many flooding and tornado events.\n\nHer favorite memory in was spending a week in Omaha, Nebraska, covering the Arkansas Razorback baseball team in the 2022 College World Series (Woo Pig Sooie!).\n\nThe second day of Lydia’s career in journalism was the first day of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. She credits the pandemic with helping her learn creative ways and different angles to deliver news.\n\nLydia graduated with honors from the University of Arkansas with a major in broadcast journalism and minors in political science and Spanish. There, she was an anchor and reporter for UATV News.\n\nDuring her time off, you can likely find Lydia on a run, at a live sporting event or on the dance floor. She feels blessed to call such a beautiful city her new home, which, she says, had a big city feel but the most hospitable people.\n\nShe’d love to hear your story ideas, or just a friendly “hello.” Email her anytime at Lydia.Fielder@wsmv.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-05-24T13:53:27.760Z","twitter":"LydiaFielderTV","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086492809550","custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-18T01:53:47.580Z","description":{"basic":"Amy Bredfeldt donated one of her kidneys to her husband Stephen after it was determined they were a match."},"headlines":{"basic":"Franklin wife donates kidney, saves husband’s life","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/E0wgvtfLMGGWTYKMzjCpG5xVnbU=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"kidney transplant.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM.jpg","owner":"chuck.morris@wsmv.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/E0wgvtfLMGGWTYKMzjCpG5xVnbU=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/E0wgvtfLMGGWTYKMzjCpG5xVnbU=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/X5UUDrL6JPqXFTX4C_WnNB0irYU=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/BEAJDZCS5VCN5MXT4DRJYZBKDM.jpg","usage_instructions":"Free to use","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"162315667af0ee5ee0115b4dc7a62648e8d5eb0790aa93391c92b50f3c631c93"},"caption":"Stephen and Amy Bredfeldt are recovering after undergoing kidney surgeries.
