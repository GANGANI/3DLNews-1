      Neighborhoods: The Hidden Cities of San Francisco: The Castro</h2>
       
 
      <p>Out of the heart of San Francisco comes an epic story that is at once 
        poignant and controversial -- a tale of social upheaval, political assassination, 
        and devastating plague -- all happening within a few square blocks, and 
        in just a few short years. 
      </p> 
      <p>Airing during Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, <b>The Castro</b>, premiered 
        Friday, June 12, 1998 at 9:00 pm on PBS. The 90-minute documentary tells 
        the dramatic story of how a quiet corner of San Francisco became the cornerstone 
        of a movement-an international symbol of gay liberation. 
      </p> 
      <p>Using rare archival film and fresh contemporary footage, the story of 
        the Castro's transformation is told here for the first time on television. 
        Because it is a recent chapter in American social history, the story is 
        told by the people who lived it: young and old, straight and gay. They 
        bring to life a history ranging from the discriminatory world of the 1950s, 
        through the flowering of &quot;gay power,&quot; and into the age of AIDS. 
      </p> 
      <p>&quot;The drama in this one neighborhood is remarkable,&quot; says producer/director 
        Peter L. Stein. &quot;It's the story of men and women who came to San 
        Francisco, seeking a place to call home when their own homes were often 
        hostile to them. In the process they built a whole culture, with nationwide 
        ramifications.&quot; 
      </p> 
      <p>What happened in the Castro changed the way Americans viewed gays and 
        lesbians. For the first time, this long-persecuted minority had the audacity 
        to lay claim to a residential neighborhood as its own -- and to begin 
        exercising its own political and economic clout. The Castro of the 1970s 
        became, for many gays and lesbians, both a haven from prejudice, and a 
        model for joining the fabric of middle-class American society. At the 
        same time, the neighborhood became a lightning rod for America's growing 
        discomfort with the new openness of gays in their midst. 
      </p> 
      <p><b>The Castro reveals key factors in the transformation of the neighborhood:</b> 
      </p> 
      <p>The roots of a gay subculture in San Francisco long predate the rise 
        of the Castro in the 1970s. Despite having a reputation for tolerance, 
        San Francisco experienced a period of harsh harassment of gays and lesbians 
        through the 1950's. Ironically, that discrimination helped build a politically 
        aware gay community in San Francisco that drew national attention in the 
        1960s. 
      </p> 
      <p>Not long after the famed &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in 1967, the demise 
        of the nearby Haight-Ashbury district prompted many of San Francisco's 
        counterculture gay youth to migrate &quot;over the hill&quot; to what 
        was called Eureka Valley, in search of cheap communal housing. 
      </p> 
      <p>Harvey Milk, a local merchant and charismatic neighborhood booster, became 
        known as &quot;the Mayor of Castro Street&quot; through his efforts to 
        organize a new political force out of the gay culture springing up in 
        the Castro. Elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1977, he became the 
        first openly gay elected official in California. Just a year later, his 
        assassination by a fellow Supervisor rocked the city, and signaled just 
        how volatile an issue the integration of gays and lesbians into mainstream 
        society still was, even in San Francisco. 
      </p> 
      <p>
      <b>Meet Witnesses to an Ongoing Movement:</b> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Meet the original merchants and families of Eureka Valley, like Sharon 
            Johnson, who says &quot;I remember my father being horrified&quot; 
            The very idea that homosexuals were moving into the neighborhood was 
            scary to them. They didn't know what that meant for them.&quot; </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Meet the lesbian and gay pioneers who paved the way through for a 
            community to evolve in San Francisco in the 1950s, such as Dorrwin 
            Jones, who says &quot;I often tell young people that we weren't just 
            in closets. We were under rocks. It was that bad.&quot; </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Meet those who planted rainbow flags in the neighborhood in the `70s, 
            including Walter Park, who says, &quot;When I was 25, the Castro meant 
            'gay men in an island' and we really needed that.&quot; </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Meet the self-styled &quot;queer&quot; youth disaffected from the 
            neighborhood today such as Rachel Timoner, who says &quot;The Castro 
            is like a mirage. On the surface it's supposed to be one thing, but 
            in reality, it's something else. It's supposed to be a gay Mecca, 
            but when you get there it's a commercial strip and houses.&quot; </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      &quot;The neighborhood has evolved as gay culture has evolved,&quot; 
        says Stein. &quot;Nowadays people are beginning to grapple with the problem 
        of the Castro being predominately white, male, and middle-class. And the 
        fear that the place is becoming a kind of commercialized &quot;gay theme 
        park&quot; indicates how far the economic clout of the neighborhood has 
        come. It's being seen not as an enclave now, but a market niche -- and 
        that angers people.&quot; 
      </p> 
      <p>
      <b>The Castro</b> has won a George Foster Peabody Award, a CINE Golden 
        Eagle Award and has been invited to be screened at numerous film festivals 
        in the United States and abroad. 
      </p> 
      <p>
      The program continues the PBS tradition of presenting universally accessible 
        programming that reflects America's cultural history.
