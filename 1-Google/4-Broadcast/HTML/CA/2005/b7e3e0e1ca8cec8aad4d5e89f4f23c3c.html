<p>Frank Green is a veteran television journalist and documentary filmmaker. His career as a producer for NBC News honed his skill in telling stories to a national audience. Green's environmental documentaries have won many national and international awards and have been shown on PBS, the Discovery Channel, Outdoor Life Network and many international television outlets. His film <b>El Dorado</b> won Best Film on Mountain Environment at the Banff Film Festival in 1997.</p>
<p>Green is a fifth-generation Californian who grew up backpacking in the Sierra Nevada and all over the West. He spent 10 years as a journalist in Southeast and East Asia at the end of the Vietnam War, including several years as NBC News bureau chief in Seoul, the first American broadcast journalist stationed there. Green graduated from Stanford University and has lectured on broadcast journalism and international reporting at the University of Texas, Austin, and San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>Green got the inspiration for <b>Counting Sheep</b> from a newspaper article about endangered wildlife of the Sierra Nevada. He didn't know there were wild bighorn sheep in the eastern Sierra, but when he heard that they were one of the most endangered mammals in North America and that they had never been filmed, it was "like waving a red flag in front of a bull." Three pair of boots, 15 expeditions, $70,000 in grants and 12 years later, <b>Counting Sheep</b> was released.</p>

The photographer struggled financially because her tone and aesthetics fell out of favor in the 1970s, as porn hit the mainstream. (&ldquo;The Yeager photographic style does not parallel the contemporary mood and image of \u003cem>Penthouse\u003c/em> magazine,&rdquo; one stinging rejection letter reads.) Only with the 1990s rise of rockabilly and swing did Yeager&rsquo;s work find a new generation of fans. During the lull before, she made ends meet with work in graphic design and even as a nightclub singer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yeager&rsquo;s personal life was also impacted by her career. One of her daughters, Cherilu Irwin, remains ashamed of her mother&rsquo;s catalog of work, speaking openly of her disapproval in \u003cem>Naked Ambition\u003c/em>. When asked what she thinks her mother&rsquo;s legacy is, Irwin leaves a long pause before openly wishing Yeager had not followed the career path she followed. Irwin&rsquo;s longing to disassociate from her mom&rsquo;s work has also clearly been a source of tension between her and her sister Lisa, who, in contrast, feels very proud of Yeager&rsquo;s accomplishments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[aside postid='arts_13954358']\u003cem>Naked Ambition\u003c/em> isn&rsquo;t all perfect. One gets the sense that darker elements of Yeager&rsquo;s story are glossed over for the sake of a more upbeat veneer. There is no commentary about the fact that her husband Bud Irwin was fired from the police force after being charged with falsifying burglary reports. There is little mention of the toll that his suicide in 1977 took on her. The fact that one of her best friends &mdash; and favorite models &mdash; \u003ca href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1790519-maria-stinger?language=en-US\">Maria Stinger\u003c/a> died by suicide in 1967 isn&rsquo;t even touched on, despite the fact that Yeager&rsquo;s working relationship with Stinger is prominently featured.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Overall, \u003cem>Naked Ambition\u003c/em> is an entertaining snapshot of a resourceful and endlessly creative woman who was determined to live life on her own terms.

Only with the 1990s rise of rockabilly and swing did Yeager&rsquo;s work find a new generation of fans.

When asked what she thinks her mother&rsquo;s legacy is, Irwin leaves a long pause before openly wishing Yeager had not followed the career path she followed. Irwin&rsquo;s longing to disassociate from her mom&rsquo;s work has also clearly been a source of tension between her and her sister Lisa, who, in contrast, feels very proud of Yeager&rsquo;s accomplishments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"aside","attributes":{"named":{"postid":"arts_13954358","label":""},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003cem>Naked Ambition\u003c/em> isn&rsquo;t all perfect.

Written specifically for parents &mdash; although also a wonderful read for anyone who wants to be more educated about the current political debates around trans people &mdash; the book is a readable, engaging and accessible introduction to the basics of what it means to be a transgender child, and the many options open to those who wish to transition. Turban admirably engages a lot of the misinformation circulating about this heavily marginalized demographic, and grounds research in firsthand stories from his own clinical work with kids.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Turban has spent much of his career in the \u003ca href=\"https://transcare.ucsf.edu/\">UCSF Gender Clinic\u003c/a>, one of the nation&rsquo;s leading clinics serving transgender minors. During our interview, he noted that some states where he considered setting down roots &mdash; including Tennessee &mdash; have outlawed such care, meaning that if he had followed that path, his career would have been brought to an untimely halt by Republican legislators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary to think,&rdquo; he says. [aside postid='arts_13957070']\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In addition to serving trans kids as a medical provider, Turban has also produced a substantial body of research. One of his frequently cited papers found that when trans youth want puberty blockers and don&rsquo;t have access to them, it is correlated with a substantial increase in suicidality across their entire lifespan, even if they later are able to get gender-affirming care as an adult. Among other things, this paper demonstrated how letting trans kids go through their natal puberty was not a neutral act, and could in fact have serious consequences.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another paper of his found that those who realized their gender identity in childhood tended to wait over a decade before disclosing it to anyone. Turban believes that these findings help dispel one of the most widely promulgated myths about trans kids, that of so-called rapid onset gender dysphoria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Rapid onset gender dysphoria is just the thing that will not die,&rdquo; he tells me. &ldquo;This whole notion that when parents find out is when kids realized for the first time is clearly false. It&rsquo;s heartbreaking that they have to wait so long before they even feel safe telling the people who are supposed to be the safest to talk to.&rdquo; [aside postid='arts_13955066']\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Turban shares his findings in ways that are vivid and easy to digest, which makes \u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em> so valuable. Among other important topics, Turban examines in detail the ill-fated attempts to find a &ldquo;cause&rdquo; for being trans (theories include bad mothering, mental illness among mothers and sexual abuse). As Turban notes, these have all been discredited, and he presents strong evidence that transness is likely biological in nature. This would accord with the experience of the vast majority of trans people, and it would also explain why attempts at conversion therapy have been such abject failures. In fact, many studies (including Turban&rsquo;s own research) have demonstrated that conversion therapy is incredibly harmful, greatly increasing suicidality and depression and failing to have any impact on identity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In spite of all that, Turban does not argue that the &ldquo;born this way&rdquo; narrative is the best way to promote trans equality. What he argues for instead is just getting to know a trans person. &ldquo;People have all these ideas and opinions about trans people, but when they finally go and meet a trans person, there&rsquo;s a major &lsquo;oh shit&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; he says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Turban described a presentation he gave to a group of medical students at Yale, using a pre-test and post-test to determine whether their attitudes shifted. He found that, even though the students left more informed, their beliefs about the ethics of trans medicine stayed the same.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Turban arranged for a trans young person to speak about her experiences to the class, everything changed. &ldquo;Major props to this girl, who did not have to do this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She just sat down and answered questions, and all the medical students came up afterwards and said things like, &lsquo;Oh my God, I can&rsquo;t believe I ever considered taking medical care away from this kid, when it&rsquo;s so clear how important this was.&rsquo;&rdquo; [aside postid='news_11966077']\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In \u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em>, Turban strikes a parallel between gay equality and trans equality, even discussing his interviews with Evan Wolfson, widely credited as an leading architect of marriage equality in the United States. As Turban notes, Wolfson has long argued that &ldquo;born this way&rdquo; might have played some role for the gay rights movement, but that the bigger gains were made when straight Americans interacted with gay ones as the latter became increasingly visible throughout society. Turban believes the same will hold true for trans equality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps this is why Turban chooses to take so much space in \u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em> to take us into the lives of the kids themselves, drawing on his own clinical work to compellingly share his clients&rsquo; searches for acceptance, bodily autonomy and safety.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the book, we meet Sam, a seven-year-old nonbinary child. Early on in working with them, Turban explains to Sam what will soon happen when they go through their natal puberty. Turban then asks Sam what they want to do &mdash; experience that puberty or try to change it &mdash; and Sam says they&rsquo;ll think about it. Turban ends up following Sam through an adolescence in which they choose not to intervene in their puberty, instead addressing their trans identity simply through things like clothing and haircuts. This episode gives the lie to prevailing myths about trans kids &mdash; that they are too young and naive to know what they want for their own bodies, and that maintaining a trans identity and a social transition will inevitably lead to medical interventions. [aside postid='arts_13858877']\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although Turban has had a very successful and rewarding career as an advocate for trans kids, it has not been without its share of difficulties. &ldquo;For the last five, ten years, there&rsquo;s been this constant stream of death threats,&rdquo; he shares. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a lot scarier, especially with the political environment right now. It&rsquo;s definitely something that I think about.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anti-trans hate campaigns also impact the kids he works with, especially when peers at school parrot hate speech. &ldquo;It just makes me want to cry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They hear things like being trans is a mental illness. Or the sports thing comes up, and they all want to quit sports or intentionally lose. Or when dating comes up, they&rsquo;re really afraid of that.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As someone who has spent years of my professional life supporting the mental health of trans people, as well as educating other clinicians about best practices for serving this demographic, Turban&rsquo;s work has been absolutely essential. His research papers are among those that I most often quote and share with colleagues and parents of trans children. They are impactful and eye-opening, and really help those who are not trans better understand the experience.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em> is a wonderful distillation of years of Turban&rsquo;s research, as well as his advocacy and countless hours of face-to-face work with these kids and their parents.

Among other things, this paper demonstrated how letting trans kids go through their natal puberty was not a neutral act, and could in fact have serious consequences.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another paper of his found that those who realized their gender identity in childhood tended to wait over a decade before disclosing it to anyone.

Among other important topics, Turban examines in detail the ill-fated attempts to find a &ldquo;cause&rdquo; for being trans (theories include bad mothering, mental illness among mothers and sexual abuse). As Turban notes, these have all been discredited, and he presents strong evidence that transness is likely biological in nature. This would accord with the experience of the vast majority of trans people, and it would also explain why attempts at conversion therapy have been such abject failures. In fact, many studies (including Turban&rsquo;s own research) have demonstrated that conversion therapy is incredibly harmful, greatly increasing suicidality and depression and failing to have any impact on identity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In spite of all that, Turban does not argue that the &ldquo;born this way&rdquo; narrative is the best way to promote trans equality. What he argues for instead is just getting to know a trans person. &ldquo;People have all these ideas and opinions about trans people, but when they finally go and meet a trans person, there&rsquo;s a major &lsquo;oh shit&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; he says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Turban described a presentation he gave to a group of medical students at Yale, using a pre-test and post-test to determine whether their attitudes shifted. He found that, even though the students left more informed, their beliefs about the ethics of trans medicine stayed the same.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Turban arranged for a trans young person to speak about her experiences to the class, everything changed. &ldquo;Major props to this girl, who did not have to do this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She just sat down and answered questions, and all the medical students came up afterwards and said things like, &lsquo;Oh my God, I can&rsquo;t believe I ever considered taking medical care away from this kid, when it&rsquo;s so clear how important this was.&rsquo;&rdquo; \u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"aside","attributes":{"named":{"postid":"news_11966077","label":""},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In \u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em>, Turban strikes a parallel between gay equality and trans equality, even discussing his interviews with Evan Wolfson, widely credited as an leading architect of marriage equality in the United States. As Turban notes, Wolfson has long argued that &ldquo;born this way&rdquo; might have played some role for the gay rights movement, but that the bigger gains were made when straight Americans interacted with gay ones as the latter became increasingly visible throughout society. Turban believes the same will hold true for trans equality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perhaps this is why Turban chooses to take so much space in \u003cem>Free to Be\u003c/em> to take us into the lives of the kids themselves, drawing on his own clinical work to compellingly share his clients&rsquo; searches for acceptance, bodily autonomy and safety.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the book, we meet Sam, a seven-year-old nonbinary child. Early on in working with them, Turban explains to Sam what will soon happen when they go through their natal puberty. Turban then asks Sam what they want to do &mdash; experience that puberty or try to change it &mdash; and Sam says they&rsquo;ll think about it. Turban ends up following Sam through an adolescence in which they choose not to intervene in their puberty, instead addressing their trans identity simply through things like clothing and haircuts. This episode gives the lie to prevailing myths about trans kids &mdash; that they are too young and naive to know what they want for their own bodies, and that maintaining a trans identity and a social transition will inevitably lead to medical interventions. \u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"aside","attributes":{"named":{"postid":"arts_13858877","label":""},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although Turban has had a very successful and rewarding career as an advocate for trans kids, it has not been without its share of difficulties. &ldquo;For the last five, ten years, there&rsquo;s been this constant stream of death threats,&rdquo; he shares. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s become a lot scarier, especially with the political environment right now.

It also supported the transitions to archival through different eras of storytelling.&rdquo; \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The documentary incorporates 8mm and 16mm film reels from Jang&rsquo;s childhood; family photographs from the 1950s and &rsquo;60s; as well as his fine art photography from the &rsquo;70s, &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s. Along with introducing Jang to audiences who didn&rsquo;t know him, Jacobs was determined to provide fresh context and new information for people who are familiar with the photographer&rsquo;s work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Some of these scenes are a bit more out of context from a traditional biographical documentary, skateboarding or the kitchen scene,&rdquo; he notes. &ldquo;They are small moments but they illustrate the real visceral immediacy of an artist living, working, breathing in the city.

It&rsquo;s going to be how I want the audience to perceive his life and times.

Being an artist is already living with a certain amount of vulnerability, and that vulnerability is only heightened with cameras and filmmakers.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jacobs developed a level of trust with Jang that is palpable on screen.

It&rsquo;s going to be how I want the audience to perceive his life and times. We&rsquo;re going to make choices that he may not like or agree with. \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a delicate, delicate balance with a documentary subject who has never really been exposed in this way,&rdquo; Jacobs continues. &ldquo;I really empathize with that. Being an artist is already living with a certain amount of vulnerability, and that vulnerability is only heightened with cameras and filmmakers.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Jacobs developed a level of trust with Jang that is palpable on screen.

Nearly 20 years later &mdash; now a veteran, community fixture and business savant &mdash; he&rsquo;s finally decided to drop the video.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mistah F.A.B. is known for pouring his all into The Town. In addition to running \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dopeeraco/?hl=en\">Dope Era\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/arts/13908484/mistah-fab-week-dope-era-academy-dezis-oakland\">a clothing shop that also offers a youth arts development component\u003c/a>), he recently began offering \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVbQyGJGWgw\">Thug Therapy\u003c/a> (a free, bimonthly support group for men).&nbsp; But &ldquo;N.E.W. Oakland&rdquo; shows how F.A.B. was bringing folks together long before that, with a call for pride and unity in the Oakland hip-hop scene.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ode recounts each side of Oakland (the North, East and West) with a triumvirate of game-certified, lyrically diverse representatives: F.A.B., \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trugstack/\">G-Stack\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/billybavgate/?hl=en\">Bavgate\u003c/a>. As a young, rising freestyle rapper, Mistah F.A.B. &mdash; the self-proclaimed &ldquo;Prince of the O&rdquo; &mdash; first got the idea when he ran into the pair of Oakland legends, whom he grew up idolizing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I was in the studio and was like, there go G-Stack, that&rsquo;s a super pioneer for the culture with [his group] The Delinquents, and what they done for Oakland. Then Bavgate walked into the studio after that. He used to be with No Limit [Records], selling millions,&rdquo; F.A.B. recalls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m from the North, he&rsquo;s from the East, he&rsquo;s from the West.&rsquo; Let&rsquo;s do a record about the whole Town being together.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I had a beat from E-A-Ski and I freestyled the hook,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Everyone was like &lsquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s cold.&rsquo; So we wrote our verses. [But] never would I have thought that &lsquo;N.E.W Oakland&rsquo; would be a song that stands as a Bay Area anthem.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E0FIFuJZ64\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Unlike so many rap songs about warring factions, &ldquo;N.E.W. Oakland&rdquo; brings each side of Oakland together on equal footing, with shout-outs to each neighborhood&rsquo;s markers. There may not be another hook with as much centrifugal gravity for all of Oakland as when F.A.B. shouts, &ldquo;I got the North, got the East, got the West with me.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the time of the song&rsquo;s release, F.A.B. says that North Oakland wasn&rsquo;t receiving its proper respect, often being left out of the larger rap conversation, while East and West Oakland rappers got their shine. In the 2005 Keak Da Sneak track &ldquo;Town Business,&rdquo; for example, the raspy-voiced linguist rattles off a litany of Oakland locations &mdash; but none from the North side.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;That was a big record that summer,&rdquo; F.A.B. says. &ldquo;I was like &lsquo;Damn, y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t say nothing about North Oakland.&rsquo; So when I did my verse [on &lsquo;N.E.W. Oakland&rsquo;], I started it out with the same cadence Keak used but it included areas from North Oakland. It was a friendly response to my big brother about how they forgot about us. It&rsquo;s not no diss or anything. It&rsquo;s just letting people know about the North.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the opening verse of &ldquo;N.E.W. Oakland,&rdquo; Fabby bombards listeners with references to &ldquo;the North Pole&rdquo; &mdash; Gaskill, Bushrod, 62nd, Goldenville. He then reminds the Bay Area that Oakland is bigger than its notorious East and West sides: &ldquo;My side been forgot about and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hot about.&rdquo; Then he enlists two lyrical giants from each contingent to tell their sides.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The song was instantly a hit on street corners, at house parties, lakeside cookouts, car cruises and more. And its unifying theme is surely part of the reason the new video struck such a deep chord with today&rsquo;s audience after it premiered on May 10.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_11754468\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 1071px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11754468\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB.jpg\" alt=\"Mistah F.A.B. headlines a show honoring the legacy of Oakland's Mac Dre\" width=\"1071\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB.jpg 1071w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB-400x235.jpg 400w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB-800x471.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB-768x452.jpg 768w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Mistah-FAB-960x565.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mistah F.A.B. made a name for himself during the hyphy movement with his unapologetic representation of North Oakland. \u003ccite>(Photo: Courtesy of Mistah F.A.B.)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Shot and directed by Thee Shooters, the video is a mix of documentary and artistic angling, spanning each rapper&rsquo;s turf &mdash; beginning in the North, then sliding through the Deep East and circling back to Ghost Town in the West.

In fact, most of Mistah F.A.B.&rsquo;s legendary discography &mdash; along with many of the alpha rappers of his generation and prior &mdash; didn&rsquo;t have official videos until later in their careers.

The idea first came together organically during F.A.B.&rsquo;s birthday party earlier this year; G-Stack and Bavgate were in attendance. F.A.B. realized he had a film crew available that could do what he didn&rsquo;t have the ability to do at 21 years old. So he locked it in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Documentation supersedes conversation,&rdquo; says Mistah F.A.B., like a professor about to freestyle an entire dissertation. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s locked in, there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about. We here. You can see it for yourself. We just captured the moment.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The video serves as a testament to not only what Oakland is right now, but what it felt like back then &mdash; if not in the physical form, then at least in the spiritual realm. Due to relentless waves of gentrification that have dismantled so many community hubs, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what this video might&rsquo;ve looked like if it came out in &lsquo;05 instead of &lsquo;24. That&rsquo;s not lost on the artist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Some of my friends that were there when we made this [song], they&rsquo;re no longer living,&rdquo; says F.A.B. Same for physical landmarks that are no longer here: &ldquo;When I talk about Goldenville, that was a project building we all grew up in. Know what I&rsquo;m saying? I would&rsquo;ve loved to get those kinds of buildings and people in it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>F.A.B. even admits that he initially thought the video could&rsquo;ve worked in black and white. But he&rsquo;s ultimately glad it&rsquo;s in color. The energy and liveliness of contemporary Oakland is exactly what he had hoped to convey, without diluting it or hyperbolizing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The directors did a hell of a job of capturing the energy,&rdquo; F.A.B. says. &ldquo;If you ever wanted to know what Oakland looks like, here it is.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003chr>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>Mistah F.A.B. hosts \u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0sNjAywbV/\">\u003ci>Thug Therapy\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003ci>, a mental health check-in for men,&nbsp; on first and third Wednesdays from 6 to 9 p.m. at Oakstop California Ballroom (1736 Franklin St., Oakland).

They made mixtapes, and then there were bootleg mixes of pixelated slideshows created by avid fans on YouTube, long before social media existed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_13922618\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 1499px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-13922618\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB.jpg\" alt=\"Two men dressed in black stand on stage, smiling\" width=\"1499\" height=\"843\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB.jpg 1499w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB-800x450.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB-1020x574.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB-160x90.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/IceCube.MistahFAB-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1499px) 100vw, 1499px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ice Cube and Mistah FAB on stage at Fremont High School to commemorate the unveiling of &lsquo;Too $hort Way&rsquo; on Dec. 10, 2022. \u003ccite>(Kristie Song/KQED)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>For F.A.B., it only felt right to resuscitate an important moment in Oakland&rsquo;s rap history by providing a video. The idea first came together organically during F.A.B.&rsquo;s birthday party earlier this year; G-Stack and Bavgate were in attendance. F.A.B. realized he had a film crew available that could do what he didn&rsquo;t have the ability to do at 21 years old. So he locked it in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Documentation supersedes conversation,&rdquo; says Mistah F.A.B., like a professor about to freestyle an entire dissertation. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s locked in, there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about. We here. You can see it for yourself. We just captured the moment.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The video serves as a testament to not only what Oakland is right now, but what it felt like back then &mdash; if not in the physical form, then at least in the spiritual realm. Due to relentless waves of gentrification that have dismantled so many community hubs, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what this video might&rsquo;ve looked like if it came out in &lsquo;05 instead of &lsquo;24. That&rsquo;s not lost on the artist.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Some of my friends that were there when we made this [song], they&rsquo;re no longer living,&rdquo; says F.A.B. Same for physical landmarks that are no longer here: &ldquo;When I talk about Goldenville, that was a project building we all grew up in. Know what I&rsquo;m saying? I would&rsquo;ve loved to get those kinds of buildings and people in it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>F.A.B. even admits that he initially thought the video could&rsquo;ve worked in black and white. But he&rsquo;s ultimately glad it&rsquo;s in color. The energy and liveliness of contemporary Oakland is exactly what he had hoped to convey, without diluting it or hyperbolizing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The directors did a hell of a job of capturing the energy,&rdquo; F.A.B. says. &ldquo;If you ever wanted to know what Oakland looks like, here it is.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003chr>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>Mistah F.A.B. hosts \u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0sNjAywbV/\">\u003ci>Thug Therapy\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003ci>, a mental health check-in for men,&nbsp; on first and third Wednesdays from 6 to 9 p.m. at Oakstop California Ballroom (1736 Franklin St., Oakland).

It picks up right where \u003cem>Book 1\u003c/em> left off (spoilers for \u003cem>Book 1\u003c/em> &hellip; now), with 10-year-old Karen in a fever dream as she processes her mother&rsquo;s death from cancer and the revelation that she had another brother named Victor before his twin Deeze killed him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[aside postid='arts_13939131']For the uninitiated, the story is essentially Karen&rsquo;s diary as she dons a detective hat and oversized coat to solve mysteries &mdash; like who killed the upstairs neighbor and where her emaciated classmate disappeared to &mdash; in 1968 Chicago, featuring historical events like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s assassination and Vietnam War protests. Karen, a monster-loving Catholic school student who identifies more with werewolves than with girls, sketches her experiences in lined notebooks. She has an astounding ability to capture people &mdash; a technically skilled artist who also sees through her subjects and depicts their nature alongside their features. And she&rsquo;s gay, something her beloved Mama definitely did not approve of and which she must now reconcile with the society she lives in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Monsters\u003c/em> may be narrated by a kid, but it is definitely an adult book with adult language and themes.

Along with why school sucks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And I cannot give Ferris enough accolades for acknowledging the depth of children, who often see and understand more than most adults want to admit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Ferris revels in gray areas and often calls taboos and moral lines into question, using Karen&rsquo;s elementary-age perspective as an opportunity to see people not as their profession, race or sexuality, but as people &mdash; or, in any case, monsters, but equalizing regardless.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although \u003cem>Book 2\u003c/em> has an introduction and brief callbacks to remind readers who&rsquo;s who and what happened, it&rsquo;s really best to read or reread \u003cem>Book 1\u003c/em> first. There are tons of characters at play and it&rsquo;s a multi-faceted story that requires deep reading. The recaps are decent reminders, but they can&rsquo;t possibly capture the nuance from \u003cem>Book 1\u003c/em> in just a page or two.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[aside postid='arts_13930727']If \u003cem>Book 2\u003c/em> seems almost too familiar, that&rsquo;s because it follows the same basic plot arc as \u003cem>Book 1\u003c/em>, even down to starting and ending with wild dreams. But unlike its prequel, the plot jumps around with considerably more frequency and suddenness.
