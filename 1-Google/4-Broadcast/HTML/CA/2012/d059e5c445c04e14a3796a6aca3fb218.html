<p>MindShift explores the future of learning and how we raise our kids. We report on how teaching is evolving to better meet the needs of students and how caregivers can better guide their children. This means examining the role of technology, discoveries about the brain, racial and gender bias in education, social and emotional learning, inequities, mental health and many other issues that affect students. We report on shifts in how educators teach as they apply innovative ideas to help students learn.</p>

For example, when I made the decision to share with my parents how I experienced their parenting, I wrote in my journal what I perceived the feared task to be. I had lots of language from my therapist about the necessity of a conversation with them, but I needed to see the charge explained in my own words. Using my own words to spell out the task also served as an additional way for me to reflect and move toward clarity. To summarize the journey in my words required that I was very clear on what I needed to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even situations that might seem less emotionally charged at first can surface fear when we don&rsquo;t know where to begin. For example, years ago, I learned about \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61731/how-universal-design-for-learning-helps-students-merge-onto-the-learning-expressway\">the importance of multimodality\u003c/a> in teaching and learning, and I wanted to bring what I&rsquo;d learned into my classroom. It was not easy, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/55127/safeguarding-the-mental-health-of-teachers\">I felt overwhelmed\u003c/a>. I had not been prepared to take up multimodalities during my journey toward becoming a teacher. I had already begun refining my teaching practice and concretizing my ideas about how my classroom should look and feel. Suddenly, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60120/helicopter-teaching-how-using-student-feedback-can-help-with-that\">I was challenged to grow\u003c/a>. I was challenged to try something new and, in my mind, big. I was afraid to start. So, I wrote about it. I journaled about what I thought I was being called to do to transform my classroom into one that invited and encouraged students to embrace their multiple modalities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Step 2:\u003c/strong> After reflecting on the task at hand in your own voice, imagine yourself on the other side of the moment, paying close attention to what you feel. I ask myself, how might I feel once I complete this task? What is the goal? How will I know I&rsquo;ve done it? To return to my previous example about incorporating more opportunities for multimodality into my classroom, I extended my previous journal post to include language such as this:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This feels very good. I always wanted my classroom to be a space where students could exist in multiple ways. And now it is. What a year we&rsquo;ve had. I started simple with making sure that each assessment had multimodal options, and the students really responded well. I got to learn so much more about them and myself. We all grew in our creativity, criticality, and innovation. And I even had a few students share that this was an important year for them because they felt seen and got to get better at video editing, which was important for them.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the time I wrote this text, it was aspirational &mdash; I hadn&rsquo;t yet begun to incorporate multimodality. I was using the reflection to cast a vision, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60885/how-to-create-a-stem-dream-culture-for-all-students\">dream a dream\u003c/a>. It allowed me to identify a goal and articulate what I was working toward, therefore directing my attention away from all the fear I had about starting the process. This also connects to the work of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jamila_lyiscott?lang=en\">Jamila Lyiscott\u003c/a>, who encourages us to move forward with vision by focusing on what we are fighting for, not only what we are fighting against. So, this second step is an invitation for you to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/59459/harnessing-the-power-of-future-forecasting-to-help-invent-a-better-world\">cast your vision\u003c/a> and become clear about what kind of life and approach to teaching you are working toward. Based on your articulation of the task in step one, what do you want to see? Imagine yourself seeing and experiencing it. Dream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Step 3:\u003c/strong> Take the vision articulated in step two and \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/51765/procrastinating-still-how-a-tomato-timer-can-help-you-stop-putting-things-off\">separate it into smaller, bite-sized pieces\u003c/a>. I use a calendar or something similar to set goals and expectations for each smaller task. This step has always felt the most familiar to me as an educator: I have grown accustomed to working backward when designing lesson plans, unit plans, activities and other classroom resources. Shout-out to \u003ca href=\"https://www.ascd.org/books/understanding-by-design-expanded-2nd-edition?chapter=understanding-understanding\">Understanding by Design\u003c/a> for the process. Using the Understanding by Design framework, I begin by identifying the desired results or end product for students and work backward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, my goal for incorporating multimodalities into my classroom was making sure to invite and encourage students to share their ideas and understandings in a variety of ways outside of traditional print. With my goal identified, I then ask myself what that end &ldquo;thing&rdquo; looks like. For example, what was my vision for a more multimodal classroom? Many folks in the field might refer to this as evidence of learning or the thing that students produce to demonstrate their learning with regard to the goals and objectives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once I have a vision for what I expect students to be able to produce, I then ask myself, what are all the things students need to know and be able to do to successfully produce the final product? What are the things we should explore? For example, we might need to explore various examples of knowledge sharing so that students would be aware of all the options they had for sharing what they knew. In addition, it might be a good idea to have time to explore and define the concept of knowledge for ourselves. Then I place these examples and all the other items needed for the final product in a sequence. That is, I could dedicate classes one and two to engaging with multimodal examples and unpacking knowledge. The following classes would be more explicitly devoted to content aligned with our content objectives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once I am clear about what my vision and end goals are, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/50947/how-reverse-planning-for-goals-can-help-students-succeed-in-school\">I can work backward\u003c/a>. If I wanted to bring to life the multimodal classroom I envisioned during step two, what were the day-to-day things I needed to do to reach that goal? And for executing my goal, I rely on expectations and dates. I know deadlines and due dates produce anxiety for some folks. So, again, please do what makes sense for you. However, I encourage you to have some way to hold your-\u003cbr>\nself accountable for your growth toward bringing to fruition your vision from step two.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Step 4:\u003c/strong> Finally, breathe. Someone very special in my life constantly says to me that it is not usually a great idea to show up to the work we want to do tired. This reminds me to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57716/we-need-to-be-nurtured-too-many-teachers-say-theyre-reaching-a-breaking-point\">rest and take care of myself\u003c/a> so that when I show up to this important work, I have something to give and pour into it. So, breathe. And when you are ready, start.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shamarikreid?lang=en\">\u003cem>Shamari Reid\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> is an assistant professor of justice and belonging in education at New York University.

To return to my previous example about incorporating more opportunities for multimodality into my classroom, I extended my previous journal post to include language such as this:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This feels very good. I always wanted my classroom to be a space where students could exist in multiple ways. And now it is. What a year we&rsquo;ve had. I started simple with making sure that each assessment had multimodal options, and the students really responded well. I got to learn so much more about them and myself. We all grew in our creativity, criticality, and innovation. And I even had a few students share that this was an important year for them because they felt seen and got to get better at video editing, which was important for them.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the time I wrote this text, it was aspirational &mdash; I hadn&rsquo;t yet begun to incorporate multimodality. I was using the reflection to cast a vision, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60885/how-to-create-a-stem-dream-culture-for-all-students\">dream a dream\u003c/a>. It allowed me to identify a goal and articulate what I was working toward, therefore directing my attention away from all the fear I had about starting the process. This also connects to the work of \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jamila_lyiscott?lang=en\">Jamila Lyiscott\u003c/a>, who encourages us to move forward with vision by focusing on what we are fighting for, not only what we are fighting against. So, this second step is an invitation for you to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/59459/harnessing-the-power-of-future-forecasting-to-help-invent-a-better-world\">cast your vision\u003c/a> and become clear about what kind of life and approach to teaching you are working toward. Based on your articulation of the task in step one, what do you want to see? Imagine yourself seeing and experiencing it. Dream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Step 3:\u003c/strong> Take the vision articulated in step two and \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/51765/procrastinating-still-how-a-tomato-timer-can-help-you-stop-putting-things-off\">separate it into smaller, bite-sized pieces\u003c/a>. I use a calendar or something similar to set goals and expectations for each smaller task. This step has always felt the most familiar to me as an educator: I have grown accustomed to working backward when designing lesson plans, unit plans, activities and other classroom resources. Shout-out to \u003ca href=\"https://www.ascd.org/books/understanding-by-design-expanded-2nd-edition?chapter=understanding-understanding\">Understanding by Design\u003c/a> for the process. Using the Understanding by Design framework, I begin by identifying the desired results or end product for students and work backward.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, my goal for incorporating multimodalities into my classroom was making sure to invite and encourage students to share their ideas and understandings in a variety of ways outside of traditional print. With my goal identified, I then ask myself what that end &ldquo;thing&rdquo; looks like. For example, what was my vision for a more multimodal classroom? Many folks in the field might refer to this as evidence of learning or the thing that students produce to demonstrate their learning with regard to the goals and objectives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once I have a vision for what I expect students to be able to produce, I then ask myself, what are all the things students need to know and be able to do to successfully produce the final product? What are the things we should explore? For example, we might need to explore various examples of knowledge sharing so that students would be aware of all the options they had for sharing what they knew. In addition, it might be a good idea to have time to explore and define the concept of knowledge for ourselves. Then I place these examples and all the other items needed for the final product in a sequence. That is, I could dedicate classes one and two to engaging with multimodal examples and unpacking knowledge. The following classes would be more explicitly devoted to content aligned with our content objectives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once I am clear about what my vision and end goals are, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/50947/how-reverse-planning-for-goals-can-help-students-succeed-in-school\">I can work backward\u003c/a>. If I wanted to bring to life the multimodal classroom I envisioned during step two, what were the day-to-day things I needed to do to reach that goal? And for executing my goal, I rely on expectations and dates. I know deadlines and due dates produce anxiety for some folks. So, again, please do what makes sense for you. However, I encourage you to have some way to hold your-\u003cbr>\nself accountable for your growth toward bringing to fruition your vision from step two.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Step 4:\u003c/strong> Finally, breathe. Someone very special in my life constantly says to me that it is not usually a great idea to show up to the work we want to do tired. This reminds me to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57716/we-need-to-be-nurtured-too-many-teachers-say-theyre-reaching-a-breaking-point\">rest and take care of myself\u003c/a> so that when I show up to this important work, I have something to give and pour into it.

This approach includes three main components: choosing, gathering and clean-up.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"S2 W4 - Beyond Pen and Paper: Play as a Tool for Standards Based Learning\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvYyOdva10E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Choosing: Pick your play\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/52421/what-giving-students-choice-looks-like-in-the-classroom\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">choosing step\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the play workshop structure, students are given the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/52424/why-choice-matters-to-student-learning\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">autonomy to select the activity\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> they&rsquo;d like to do. &ldquo;We can invoke a playful spirit any time we bring up choice. The more choice, the more it feels like play,&rdquo; said Mraz. Many teachers find it effective to use centers or stations to offer activity choices in the classroom.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if a teacher is focused on guiding students through creating a story using a sequence of events, they may offer students the option to draw their story, use a variety of materials to construct it or engage in dramatic play to act it out. &ldquo;These all bring us to the standards, but they bring us there in a way that leverages kids&rsquo; natural inclinations to play,&rdquo; said Mraz. She recommended Susan Harris MacKay&rsquo;s book \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.heinemann.com/products/e12034.aspx\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Story Workshop\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as a resource for using play to meet learning standards related to storytelling\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mraz also encouraged teachers to be flexible. Initially, she required students to select a path and stick with it. However, she has since realized that being adaptable can improve student engagement and creativity. &ldquo;Some days [students] just might need to move around, or sometimes doing something in one area actually inspires [them] in another area,&rdquo; she said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Gathering: Construct ideas&nbsp;\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">After students have played, the gathering phase provides time for students to share their thoughts, reflect on their experiences and collaboratively build knowledge. Mraz suggested that students sit in a circle for this phase. Teachers may guide students to explore various content areas, reflect on themes from the play, address problems that came up or discuss the materials being used. &ldquo;In order to construct knowledge, you have to have opportunities to process it with people,&rdquo; Mraz said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In one class, Mraz used gathering time to talk about different ways to share materials. Students identified different sharing strategies they used during their play, such as taking turns, splitting items or finding additional materials. Mraz created a chart with these strategies and asked if any students had experiences that could be addressed with those ideas. The activity built on students&rsquo; reading and problem-solving skills, Mraz said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">To help teachers build their facilitation skills, Mraz recommended \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Hands-Down-Speak-Out-Listening-and-Talking-Across-Literacy-and-Math/Wedekind-HermannThompson/p/book/9781625312693\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hands Down, Speak Out: Listening and Talking Across Literacy and Math\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by Kassia Omohundro Wedekind and Christy Hermann Thompson. &ldquo;[It&rsquo;s] a brilliant text on how to develop these circle conversations in your classroom with tons of practical strategy,&rdquo; said Mraz.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Clean up: Collaborate toward a shared goal\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The clean-up phase of the play workshop structure is not merely about tidying up but about instilling a sense of responsibility and cooperation. While the usual approach might have each child cleaning up their own play area, Mraz suggested organizing clean-up to reflect how it works in the real world. For example, in a family, clean-up tasks are often shared: One person might clear the table, another might wash the dishes and another might dry them. Students can follow a similar structure.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead of &ldquo;clean up your own mess,&rdquo; Mraz uses the message, &ldquo;our community works to make our space clean.&rdquo; She assigns specific roles to small groups of students, such as table wipers, block cleaners and a timer setter. &ldquo;Every child is able to contribute to clean up in a way that plays to their strengths,&rdquo; she explained.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mraz acknowledged that while play-based learning is familiar to many early childhood educators, incorporating these strategies can be daunting for teachers who rely on traditional methods. Even small shifts can make a significant difference, she said. &ldquo;Is there one small movement you can make that brings us closer to a world that values children in their natural state, so that children grow to be the people who value one another in their natural state?&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\n","blocks":[],"excerpt":"The play workshop structure uses guided activities, reflection and cooperative clean up to foster academic and social-emotional growth.","status":"publish","parent":0,"modified":1716597625,"stats":{"hasAudio":false,"hasVideo":true,"hasChartOrMap":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"hasPolis":false,"paragraphCount":14,"wordCount":955},"headData":{"title":"Want to Incorporate More Play in Learning?

It is a method.&rdquo; During a talk at The \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://gathering.theeducatorcollaborative.com/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Educator Collaborative 2023 Gathering\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mraz outlined an approach known as the play workshop structure that can help teachers incorporate play into subjects like reading, writing and math. This approach includes three main components: choosing, gathering and clean-up.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ciframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"S2 W4 - Beyond Pen and Paper: Play as a Tool for Standards Based Learning\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvYyOdva10E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Choosing: Pick your play\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/52421/what-giving-students-choice-looks-like-in-the-classroom\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">choosing step\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the play workshop structure, students are given the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/52424/why-choice-matters-to-student-learning\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">autonomy to select the activity\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> they&rsquo;d like to do. &ldquo;We can invoke a playful spirit any time we bring up choice. The more choice, the more it feels like play,&rdquo; said Mraz. Many teachers find it effective to use centers or stations to offer activity choices in the classroom.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if a teacher is focused on guiding students through creating a story using a sequence of events, they may offer students the option to draw their story, use a variety of materials to construct it or engage in dramatic play to act it out. &ldquo;These all bring us to the standards, but they bring us there in a way that leverages kids&rsquo; natural inclinations to play,&rdquo; said Mraz. She recommended Susan Harris MacKay&rsquo;s book \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.heinemann.com/products/e12034.aspx\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Story Workshop\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as a resource for using play to meet learning standards related to storytelling\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mraz also encouraged teachers to be flexible. Initially, she required students to select a path and stick with it. However, she has since realized that being adaptable can improve student engagement and creativity. &ldquo;Some days [students] just might need to move around, or sometimes doing something in one area actually inspires [them] in another area,&rdquo; she said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Gathering: Construct ideas&nbsp;\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">After students have played, the gathering phase provides time for students to share their thoughts, reflect on their experiences and collaboratively build knowledge. Mraz suggested that students sit in a circle for this phase. Teachers may guide students to explore various content areas, reflect on themes from the play, address problems that came up or discuss the materials being used. &ldquo;In order to construct knowledge, you have to have opportunities to process it with people,&rdquo; Mraz said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In one class, Mraz used gathering time to talk about different ways to share materials. Students identified different sharing strategies they used during their play, such as taking turns, splitting items or finding additional materials. Mraz created a chart with these strategies and asked if any students had experiences that could be addressed with those ideas. The activity built on students&rsquo; reading and problem-solving skills, Mraz said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">To help teachers build their facilitation skills, Mraz recommended \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Hands-Down-Speak-Out-Listening-and-Talking-Across-Literacy-and-Math/Wedekind-HermannThompson/p/book/9781625312693\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hands Down, Speak Out: Listening and Talking Across Literacy and Math\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by Kassia Omohundro Wedekind and Christy Hermann Thompson. &ldquo;[It&rsquo;s] a brilliant text on how to develop these circle conversations in your classroom with tons of practical strategy,&rdquo; said Mraz.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Clean up: Collaborate toward a shared goal\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The clean-up phase of the play workshop structure is not merely about tidying up but about instilling a sense of responsibility and cooperation. While the usual approach might have each child cleaning up their own play area, Mraz suggested organizing clean-up to reflect how it works in the real world. For example, in a family, clean-up tasks are often shared: One person might clear the table, another might wash the dishes and another might dry them. Students can follow a similar structure.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead of &ldquo;clean up your own mess,&rdquo; Mraz uses the message, &ldquo;our community works to make our space clean.&rdquo; She assigns specific roles to small groups of students, such as table wipers, block cleaners and a timer setter. &ldquo;Every child is able to contribute to clean up in a way that plays to their strengths,&rdquo; she explained.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mraz acknowledged that while play-based learning is familiar to many early childhood educators, incorporating these strategies can be daunting for teachers who rely on traditional methods. Even small shifts can make a significant difference, she said. &ldquo;Is there one small movement you can make that brings us closer to a world that values children in their natural state, so that children grow to be the people who value one another in their natural state?&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/63891/want-to-incorporate-more-play-in-learning-try-the-play-workshop-structure","authors":["11721"],"programs":["mindshift_21847"],"categories":["mindshift_193"],"tags":["mindshift_21260","mindshift_498","mindshift_943","mindshift_91","mindshift_21166"],"featImg":"mindshift_63892","label":"mindshift_21847"},"mindshift_63870":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_63870","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"63870","score":null,"sort":[1716804046000]},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"school-vendors-get-paid-no-matter-the-outcome-ome-schools-are-changing-the-contracts","title":"School Vendors Get Paid No Matter the Outcome.

Yet central-office bureaucrats frequently renew their contracts with outside vendors regardless of usage or efficacy.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">One idea for smarter education spending is for schools to sign smarter contracts, where part of the payment is contingent upon whether students use the services and learn more. It&rsquo;s called \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62445/denver-public-schools-pledged-to-pay-tutoring-vendors-based-on-their-results-did-it-work\">outcomes-based contracting\u003c/a> and is a way of sharing risk between buyer (the school) and seller (the vendor). Outcomes-based contracting is most \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10397909/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">common in healthcare\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For example, a health insurer might pay a pharmaceutical company more for a drug if it actually improves people&rsquo;s health, and less if it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the idea is relatively new in education, many schools tried a different version of it &ndash; evaluating and paying teachers based on how much their students&rsquo; test scores improved &ndash; in the 2010s. Teachers didn&rsquo;t like it, and enthusiasm for these teacher accountability schemes waned. Then, in 2020, \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://cepr.harvard.edu/obci\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Harvard University&rsquo;s Center for Education Policy Research\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> announced that it was going to test the feasibility of paying tutoring companies by how much students&rsquo; test scores improved.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The initiative was particularly timely in the wake of the pandemic. The federal government would eventually give schools almost $190 billion to reopen and to help students who fell behind when schools were closed. \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/tag/tutoring\">Tutoring became a leading solution for academic recovery\u003c/a>, and schools contracted with outside companies to provide tutors. Many educators worried that billions could be wasted on low-quality tutors who didn&rsquo;t help anyone. Could schools insist that tutoring companies make part of their payment contingent upon whether student achievement increased?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Harvard center recruited a handful of school districts who wanted to try an outcomes-based contract. The researchers and districts shared ideas on how to set performance targets. How much should they expect student achievement to grow from a few months of tutoring? How much of the contract should be guaranteed to the vendor for delivering tutors, and how much should be contingent on student performance?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first hurdle was whether tutoring companies would be willing to offer services without knowing exactly how much they would be paid. School districts sent out requests for proposals from online tutoring companies. Tutoring companies bid and the terms varied. One online tutoring company agreed that 40% of a $1.2 million contract with the Duval County Public Schools in Jacksonville, Florida, would be contingent upon student performance. Another online tutoring company signed a contract with Ector County schools in the Odessa, Texas, region that specified that the company had to accept a penalty if kids&rsquo; scores declined.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the middle of the pilot, the outcomes-based contracting initiative \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/raymondpierce/2022/03/21/school-district-contracting-can-be-a-lever-for-equity/?sh=56f02344280c\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">moved \u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">from the Harvard center to the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://obc.southerneducation.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Southern Education Foundation\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, another nonprofit, and I recently learned how the first group of contracts panned out from Jasmine Walker, a senior manager there. Walker had a first-hand view because until the fall of 2023, she was the director of mathematics in Florida&rsquo;s Duval County schools, where she oversaw the outcomes-based contract on tutoring.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some lessons she learned.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Planning is time-consuming\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drawing up an outcomes-based contract requires analyzing years of historical testing data, and documenting how much achievement has typically grown for the students who need tutoring. Then, educators have to decide &ndash; based on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62921/four-lessons-from-post-pandemic-tutoring-research\">research evidence for tutoring\u003c/a> &ndash; how much they could reasonably hope student achievement to grow after 12 weeks or more.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Incomplete data was a common problem\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first school district in the pilot group launched its outcomes-based contract in the fall of 2021. In the middle of the pilot, school leadership changed, layoffs hit, and the leaders of the tutoring initiative left the district. With no one in the district&rsquo;s central office left to track it, there was no data on whether tutoring helped the 1,000 students who received it. Half the students attended 70% of the tutoring sessions. Half didn&rsquo;t. Test scores for almost two-thirds of the tutored students increased between the start and the end of the tutoring program. But these students also had regular math classes each day and they likely would have posted some achievement gains anyway.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Delays in settling contracts led to fewer tutored students\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker said two school districts weren&rsquo;t able to start tutoring children until January 2023, instead of the fall of 2022 as originally planned, because it took so long to iron out contract details and obtain approvals inside the districts. Many schools didn&rsquo;t want to wait and launched other interventions to help needy students sooner. Understandably, schools didn&rsquo;t want to yank these students away from those other interventions midyear.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">That delay had big consequences in Duval County. Only 451 students received tutoring instead of a projected 1,200. Fewer students forced Walker to recalculate Duval&rsquo;s outcomes-based contract. Instead of a $1.2 million contract with $480,000 of it contingent on student outcomes, she downsized it to $464,533 with $162,363 contingent. The tutored students hit 53% of the district&rsquo;s growth and proficiency goals, leading to a total payout of $393,220 to the tutoring company &ndash; far less than the company had originally anticipated. But the average per-student payout of $872 was in line with the original terms of between $600 and $1,000 per student.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The bottom line is still uncertain\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What we don&rsquo;t know from any of these \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WOlpmB9qgDGtyzxVQCn8c9UWbp65fFTG/view\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">case studies\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is whether similar students who didn&rsquo;t receive tutoring also made similar growth and proficiency gains. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the other things that teachers were doing that made the difference. In Duval County, for example, proficiency rates in math rose from 28% of students to 46% of students. Walker believes that outcomes-based contracting for tutoring was &ldquo;one lever&rdquo; of many.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It&rsquo;s unclear if outcomes-based contracting is a way for schools to save money. This kind of intensive tutoring &ndash; three times a week or more during the school day &ndash; is new and the school districts didn&rsquo;t have previous pre-pandemic tutoring contracts for comparison. But generally, if all the student goals are met, companies stand to earn more in an outcomes-based contract than they would have otherwise, Walker said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really about saving money,&rdquo; said Walker. &ldquo;What we want is for students to achieve. I don&rsquo;t care if I spent the whole contract amount if the students actually met the outcomes, because in the past, let&rsquo;s face it, I was still paying, and they were not achieving outcomes.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The biggest change with outcomes-based contracting, Walker said, was the partnership with the provider. One contractor monitored student attendance during tutoring sessions, called her when attendance slipped and asked her to investigate. Students were given rewards for attending their tutoring sessions and the tutoring company even chipped in to pay for them. &ldquo;Kids love \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://barcel-usa.com/takis\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Takis\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">,&rdquo; said Walker.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Advice for schools\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker has two pieces of advice for schools considering outcomes-based contracts. One, she says, is to make the contingency amount at least 40% of the contract. Smaller incentives may not motivate the vendor. For her second outcomes-based contract in Duval County, Walker boosted the contingency amount to half the contract. To earn it, the tutoring company needs the students it is tutoring to hit growth and proficiency goals. That tutoring took place during the current 2023-24 school year. Based on mid-year results, students exceeded expectations, but full-year results are not yet in.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">More importantly, Walker says the biggest lesson she learned was to include teachers, parents and students earlier in the contract negotiation process. She says buy-in from teachers is critical because classroom teachers are actually making sure the tutoring happens. Otherwise, an outcomes-based contract can feel like yet &ldquo;another thing&rdquo; that the central office is adding to a teacher&rsquo;s workload.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker also said she wished she had spent more time educating parents and students on the importance of attending school and their tutoring sessions. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s important that everyone understands the mission,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Innovation can be rocky, especially at the beginning. Now the Southern Education Foundation is working to expand its outcomes-based contracting initiative nationwide. A second group of four school districts launched its first outcomes-based contracts for tutoring this 2023-24 school year. Walker says that the rate cards and recordkeeping are improving from the first pilot round, which took place during the stress and chaos of the pandemic.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The foundation is also seeking to expand the use of outcomes-based contracts beyond tutoring to education technology and software. Nine districts are slated to launch outcomes-based contracts for ed tech this fall.&nbsp; Her next dream is to design outcomes-based contracts around curriculum and teacher training. I&rsquo;ll be watching.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">This story about\u003c/span>\u003c/i> \u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-outcomes-based-contracting/\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">outcomes-based contracting\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a> \u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">was written by Jill Barshay and produced by \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/higher-education/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Hechinger Report\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Yet central-office bureaucrats frequently renew their contracts with outside vendors regardless of usage or efficacy.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">One idea for smarter education spending is for schools to sign smarter contracts, where part of the payment is contingent upon whether students use the services and learn more. It&rsquo;s called \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62445/denver-public-schools-pledged-to-pay-tutoring-vendors-based-on-their-results-did-it-work\">outcomes-based contracting\u003c/a> and is a way of sharing risk between buyer (the school) and seller (the vendor). Outcomes-based contracting is most \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10397909/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">common in healthcare\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For example, a health insurer might pay a pharmaceutical company more for a drug if it actually improves people&rsquo;s health, and less if it doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the idea is relatively new in education, many schools tried a different version of it &ndash; evaluating and paying teachers based on how much their students&rsquo; test scores improved &ndash; in the 2010s. Teachers didn&rsquo;t like it, and enthusiasm for these teacher accountability schemes waned. Then, in 2020, \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://cepr.harvard.edu/obci\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Harvard University&rsquo;s Center for Education Policy Research\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> announced that it was going to test the feasibility of paying tutoring companies by how much students&rsquo; test scores improved.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The initiative was particularly timely in the wake of the pandemic. The federal government would eventually give schools almost $190 billion to reopen and to help students who fell behind when schools were closed. \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/tag/tutoring\">Tutoring became a leading solution for academic recovery\u003c/a>, and schools contracted with outside companies to provide tutors. Many educators worried that billions could be wasted on low-quality tutors who didn&rsquo;t help anyone. Could schools insist that tutoring companies make part of their payment contingent upon whether student achievement increased?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Harvard center recruited a handful of school districts who wanted to try an outcomes-based contract. The researchers and districts shared ideas on how to set performance targets. How much should they expect student achievement to grow from a few months of tutoring? How much of the contract should be guaranteed to the vendor for delivering tutors, and how much should be contingent on student performance?&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first hurdle was whether tutoring companies would be willing to offer services without knowing exactly how much they would be paid. School districts sent out requests for proposals from online tutoring companies. Tutoring companies bid and the terms varied. One online tutoring company agreed that 40% of a $1.2 million contract with the Duval County Public Schools in Jacksonville, Florida, would be contingent upon student performance. Another online tutoring company signed a contract with Ector County schools in the Odessa, Texas, region that specified that the company had to accept a penalty if kids&rsquo; scores declined.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the middle of the pilot, the outcomes-based contracting initiative \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/raymondpierce/2022/03/21/school-district-contracting-can-be-a-lever-for-equity/?sh=56f02344280c\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">moved \u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">from the Harvard center to the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://obc.southerneducation.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Southern Education Foundation\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, another nonprofit, and I recently learned how the first group of contracts panned out from Jasmine Walker, a senior manager there. Walker had a first-hand view because until the fall of 2023, she was the director of mathematics in Florida&rsquo;s Duval County schools, where she oversaw the outcomes-based contract on tutoring.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some lessons she learned.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Planning is time-consuming\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drawing up an outcomes-based contract requires analyzing years of historical testing data, and documenting how much achievement has typically grown for the students who need tutoring. Then, educators have to decide &ndash; based on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62921/four-lessons-from-post-pandemic-tutoring-research\">research evidence for tutoring\u003c/a> &ndash; how much they could reasonably hope student achievement to grow after 12 weeks or more.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Incomplete data was a common problem\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first school district in the pilot group launched its outcomes-based contract in the fall of 2021. In the middle of the pilot, school leadership changed, layoffs hit, and the leaders of the tutoring initiative left the district. With no one in the district&rsquo;s central office left to track it, there was no data on whether tutoring helped the 1,000 students who received it. Half the students attended 70% of the tutoring sessions. Half didn&rsquo;t. Test scores for almost two-thirds of the tutored students increased between the start and the end of the tutoring program. But these students also had regular math classes each day and they likely would have posted some achievement gains anyway.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Delays in settling contracts led to fewer tutored students\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker said two school districts weren&rsquo;t able to start tutoring children until January 2023, instead of the fall of 2022 as originally planned, because it took so long to iron out contract details and obtain approvals inside the districts. Many schools didn&rsquo;t want to wait and launched other interventions to help needy students sooner. Understandably, schools didn&rsquo;t want to yank these students away from those other interventions midyear.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">That delay had big consequences in Duval County. Only 451 students received tutoring instead of a projected 1,200. Fewer students forced Walker to recalculate Duval&rsquo;s outcomes-based contract. Instead of a $1.2 million contract with $480,000 of it contingent on student outcomes, she downsized it to $464,533 with $162,363 contingent. The tutored students hit 53% of the district&rsquo;s growth and proficiency goals, leading to a total payout of $393,220 to the tutoring company &ndash; far less than the company had originally anticipated. But the average per-student payout of $872 was in line with the original terms of between $600 and $1,000 per student.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The bottom line is still uncertain\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What we don&rsquo;t know from any of these \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WOlpmB9qgDGtyzxVQCn8c9UWbp65fFTG/view\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">case studies\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is whether similar students who didn&rsquo;t receive tutoring also made similar growth and proficiency gains. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the other things that teachers were doing that made the difference. In Duval County, for example, proficiency rates in math rose from 28% of students to 46% of students. Walker believes that outcomes-based contracting for tutoring was &ldquo;one lever&rdquo; of many.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">It&rsquo;s unclear if outcomes-based contracting is a way for schools to save money. This kind of intensive tutoring &ndash; three times a week or more during the school day &ndash; is new and the school districts didn&rsquo;t have previous pre-pandemic tutoring contracts for comparison. But generally, if all the student goals are met, companies stand to earn more in an outcomes-based contract than they would have otherwise, Walker said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really about saving money,&rdquo; said Walker. &ldquo;What we want is for students to achieve. I don&rsquo;t care if I spent the whole contract amount if the students actually met the outcomes, because in the past, let&rsquo;s face it, I was still paying, and they were not achieving outcomes.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The biggest change with outcomes-based contracting, Walker said, was the partnership with the provider. One contractor monitored student attendance during tutoring sessions, called her when attendance slipped and asked her to investigate. Students were given rewards for attending their tutoring sessions and the tutoring company even chipped in to pay for them. &ldquo;Kids love \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://barcel-usa.com/takis\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Takis\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">,&rdquo; said Walker.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Advice for schools\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker has two pieces of advice for schools considering outcomes-based contracts. One, she says, is to make the contingency amount at least 40% of the contract. Smaller incentives may not motivate the vendor. For her second outcomes-based contract in Duval County, Walker boosted the contingency amount to half the contract. To earn it, the tutoring company needs the students it is tutoring to hit growth and proficiency goals. That tutoring took place during the current 2023-24 school year. Based on mid-year results, students exceeded expectations, but full-year results are not yet in.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">More importantly, Walker says the biggest lesson she learned was to include teachers, parents and students earlier in the contract negotiation process. She says buy-in from teachers is critical because classroom teachers are actually making sure the tutoring happens. Otherwise, an outcomes-based contract can feel like yet &ldquo;another thing&rdquo; that the central office is adding to a teacher&rsquo;s workload.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walker also said she wished she had spent more time educating parents and students on the importance of attending school and their tutoring sessions. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s important that everyone understands the mission,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Innovation can be rocky, especially at the beginning. Now the Southern Education Foundation is working to expand its outcomes-based contracting initiative nationwide. A second group of four school districts launched its first outcomes-based contracts for tutoring this 2023-24 school year. Walker says that the rate cards and recordkeeping are improving from the first pilot round, which took place during the stress and chaos of the pandemic.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The foundation is also seeking to expand the use of outcomes-based contracts beyond tutoring to education technology and software. Nine districts are slated to launch outcomes-based contracts for ed tech this fall.&nbsp; Her next dream is to design outcomes-based contracts around curriculum and teacher training. I&rsquo;ll be watching.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">This story about\u003c/span>\u003c/i> \u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-outcomes-based-contracting/\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">outcomes-based contracting\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a> \u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">was written by Jill Barshay and produced by \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/higher-education/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Hechinger Report\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Copyright (c) 2024 by Corwin Press, Inc. All rights reserved.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some of the most effective learning strategies are those known as desirable difficulties. These make learning more effortful but are useful (desirable) because they make forgetting less likely, and help to ensure that what is practiced is both retained and can be used flexibly in the future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, could it be the case that for some learners, there are already enough difficulties in the classroom, without adding more? After all, the level of difficulty involved might be expected to vary among learners. What one learner finds quite difficult may be impossibly challenging for another, perhaps leading them to give up entirely. In short, we need to consider how to ensure that desirable difficulties are always desirable! According to \u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-14068-005\">a 2018 study\u003c/a>, &ldquo;If a learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond successfully to a given difficulty, it becomes an undesirable difficulty.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-63739\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-160x228.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-160x228.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-800x1139.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-768x1093.jpg 768w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download.jpg 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\">First, let&rsquo;s briefly recap the desirable difficulties and why they work. Desirable difficulties increase challenge in a way that is useful and pedagogically appropriate. Examples of strategies that fall into this category include retrieval or self-testing, spacing out practice, variation in practice, self-explanation when reading notes, and interleaving. These factors make classroom tasks such as reading, discussions and project work more effective, but in the process, the tasks become subjectively harder, and students tend to make more errors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The reason that these strategies work so well is because they mimic real life. In other words, the more similar we make the learning/practice situation to the real thing, the better information and skills can be retained and later used. A greater correspondence between the practice situation and later use makes it easier for learners to transfer what has been learnt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We should therefore ensure that \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62750/a-group-of-scientists-set-out-to-study-quick-learners-then-they-discovered-they-dont-exist\">these things are used for all learners\u003c/a>, and they can be used straight away and at all ages. There isn&rsquo;t a group of pupils for whom being able to retain and apply what they study over the long term is unimportant! We shouldn&rsquo;t see these strategies as dispensable, able to be dropped if students are finding things too challenging. What can be changed is the level of challenge, and this is surprisingly straightforward. However, it is best tackled one strategy at a time.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Retrieval practice\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>In general, researchers recommend that students should be getting \u003ca href=\"https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/Rosenshine.pdf\">a success rate of around 80%\u003c/a> when trying to retrieve prior learning. So, for example, you might aim to pitch the quiz at a difficulty level that means most learners are getting a few answers wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The way to adjust this for struggling learners is not to dispose of the quiz entirely, but to modify the difficulty level for different students, while ensuring that all are still prompted to retrieve. Some modifications could include:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>providing hints and cues, such as an additional sentence reminding them of a previous example;\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>reducing the number of wrong choices on a multiple-choice quiz;\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>giving the entire quiz a little sooner to these pupils than to the rest of the class (though ideally, it should still not be given straight away).\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>Less helpful modifications include anything that means the learner is not retrieving things from memory. Don&rsquo;t have them work with a partner who will recall the answers, for example, and don&rsquo;t turn a retrieval task into a copy-the-answers task.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Spacing\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Spacing out practice is hard, but also effective. As teachers, we can bear in mind that the more time that has passed, the more our learners will have forgotten. We can also try to judge (using prior experience) how much forgetting of a topic is likely to have occurred. Researchers recommend that educators schedule review tasks for a point in time when learners are on the verge of forgetting but have not yet completely forgotten. To put it another way, a little bit of forgetting is useful, but we shouldn&rsquo;t leave it too long. Revisiting learning should be planned and factored in as part of a unit of learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The speed of forgetting will depend not just on the material, but on the learner. Those with less well-developed schemas, or who practiced less effectively the first time the material was studied, will forget more rapidly. As the teacher, you can experiment with scheduling practice at different times for different learners.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Varied practice\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63315/learning-science-might-help-kids-read-better\">Varied practice can happen in a number of ways\u003c/a>, but some of the most straightforward include varying the format of the task, the context, or the place where practice takes place. Asking physics learners to write a short essay explaining particles instead of completing their usual practice problems is an example of varying the task. Studying outside instead of indoors is varying the location. For example, taking students to a local seaside as part of a geography lesson to measure &lsquo;shore drift&rsquo; for themselves, rather than seeing a short video of the process (this example is active, as well as varied).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The level of variation can range from high to low. For struggling learners, variation can be considered a bit like the &lsquo;spiciness&rsquo; level of food &ndash; it can be stronger or weaker according to what is needed. For example, it would be easier to transfer what has been learnt about vectors from one written task to another, and harder to transfer the same principles to a real scenario involving plane travel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In situations where it is impractical to vary things in different ways for different learners (for example, where the whole class is going to practice something outside), we can help struggling learners to cope with the difficulties by providing hints and reminders.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Self-explanation when reading notes\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Self-explanation is in some ways one of the easiest desirable difficulties to use, as it can be applied to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57644/13-effective-study-strategies-to-help-students-learn\">forms of study and practice\u003c/a> that a lot of learners tend to choose. Many of them prefer to study from notes or do practice problems, and could be prompted to self explain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem here lies in that some of the learners who would benefit most from this technique will tend to avoid doing it spontaneously, in part because struggling \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57734/distracted-these-four-learning-strategies-can-help\">learners often lack awareness of their own weaknesses\u003c/a>.

These make learning more effortful but are useful (desirable) because they make forgetting less likely, and help to ensure that what is practiced is both retained and can be used flexibly in the future.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, could it be the case that for some learners, there are already enough difficulties in the classroom, without adding more? After all, the level of difficulty involved might be expected to vary among learners. What one learner finds quite difficult may be impossibly challenging for another, perhaps leading them to give up entirely. In short, we need to consider how to ensure that desirable difficulties are always desirable! According to \u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-14068-005\">a 2018 study\u003c/a>, &ldquo;If a learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond successfully to a given difficulty, it becomes an undesirable difficulty.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-63739\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-160x228.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-160x228.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-800x1139.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download-768x1093.jpg 768w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/download.jpg 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\">First, let&rsquo;s briefly recap the desirable difficulties and why they work. Desirable difficulties increase challenge in a way that is useful and pedagogically appropriate. Examples of strategies that fall into this category include retrieval or self-testing, spacing out practice, variation in practice, self-explanation when reading notes, and interleaving. These factors make classroom tasks such as reading, discussions and project work more effective, but in the process, the tasks become subjectively harder, and students tend to make more errors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The reason that these strategies work so well is because they mimic real life. In other words, the more similar we make the learning/practice situation to the real thing, the better information and skills can be retained and later used. A greater correspondence between the practice situation and later use makes it easier for learners to transfer what has been learnt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We should therefore ensure that \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62750/a-group-of-scientists-set-out-to-study-quick-learners-then-they-discovered-they-dont-exist\">these things are used for all learners\u003c/a>, and they can be used straight away and at all ages. There isn&rsquo;t a group of pupils for whom being able to retain and apply what they study over the long term is unimportant! We shouldn&rsquo;t see these strategies as dispensable, able to be dropped if students are finding things too challenging. What can be changed is the level of challenge, and this is surprisingly straightforward. However, it is best tackled one strategy at a time.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Retrieval practice\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>In general, researchers recommend that students should be getting \u003ca href=\"https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/Rosenshine.pdf\">a success rate of around 80%\u003c/a> when trying to retrieve prior learning. So, for example, you might aim to pitch the quiz at a difficulty level that means most learners are getting a few answers wrong.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The way to adjust this for struggling learners is not to dispose of the quiz entirely, but to modify the difficulty level for different students, while ensuring that all are still prompted to retrieve. Some modifications could include:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>providing hints and cues, such as an additional sentence reminding them of a previous example;\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>reducing the number of wrong choices on a multiple-choice quiz;\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>giving the entire quiz a little sooner to these pupils than to the rest of the class (though ideally, it should still not be given straight away).\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>Less helpful modifications include anything that means the learner is not retrieving things from memory. Don&rsquo;t have them work with a partner who will recall the answers, for example, and don&rsquo;t turn a retrieval task into a copy-the-answers task.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Spacing\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Spacing out practice is hard, but also effective. As teachers, we can bear in mind that the more time that has passed, the more our learners will have forgotten. We can also try to judge (using prior experience) how much forgetting of a topic is likely to have occurred. Researchers recommend that educators schedule review tasks for a point in time when learners are on the verge of forgetting but have not yet completely forgotten. To put it another way, a little bit of forgetting is useful, but we shouldn&rsquo;t leave it too long. Revisiting learning should be planned and factored in as part of a unit of learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The speed of forgetting will depend not just on the material, but on the learner. Those with less well-developed schemas, or who practiced less effectively the first time the material was studied, will forget more rapidly. As the teacher, you can experiment with scheduling practice at different times for different learners.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Varied practice\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63315/learning-science-might-help-kids-read-better\">Varied practice can happen in a number of ways\u003c/a>, but some of the most straightforward include varying the format of the task, the context, or the place where practice takes place. Asking physics learners to write a short essay explaining particles instead of completing their usual practice problems is an example of varying the task. Studying outside instead of indoors is varying the location. For example, taking students to a local seaside as part of a geography lesson to measure &lsquo;shore drift&rsquo; for themselves, rather than seeing a short video of the process (this example is active, as well as varied).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The level of variation can range from high to low. For struggling learners, variation can be considered a bit like the &lsquo;spiciness&rsquo; level of food &ndash; it can be stronger or weaker according to what is needed. For example, it would be easier to transfer what has been learnt about vectors from one written task to another, and harder to transfer the same principles to a real scenario involving plane travel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In situations where it is impractical to vary things in different ways for different learners (for example, where the whole class is going to practice something outside), we can help struggling learners to cope with the difficulties by providing hints and reminders.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Self-explanation when reading notes\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Self-explanation is in some ways one of the easiest desirable difficulties to use, as it can be applied to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57644/13-effective-study-strategies-to-help-students-learn\">forms of study and practice\u003c/a> that a lot of learners tend to choose. Many of them prefer to study from notes or do practice problems, and could be prompted to self explain.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem here lies in that some of the learners who would benefit most from this technique will tend to avoid doing it spontaneously, in part because struggling \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57734/distracted-these-four-learning-strategies-can-help\">learners often lack awareness of their own weaknesses\u003c/a>.

Despite these advantages, teachers of other subjects sometimes underestimate the complexity of integrating arts practices into their classrooms. &ldquo;Art is very rigorous,&rdquo; said \u003ca href=\"https://www.christinamjenkins.com/\">Christina Jenkins\u003c/a>, an arts educator and former social studies teacher in California. &ldquo;I think that it is not given credit for being rigorous.&rdquo; Jenkins, who studied at Parsons School of Design, approached her social studies classroom &ldquo;as a non-art educator who sees the promise in art-based practices.&rdquo; Now dedicated to supporting educators in embracing creativity and prioritizing arts, she organizes field trips for educators to feel inspired about their practice and reconnect with how learning feels.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">During a recent presentation at the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://events.deeper-learning.org/events/deeper-learning-2024/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deeper Learning Conference\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in San Diego, Jenkins shared how the core arts education practices of assignment design and critique can apply to other areas of learning. As part of the session, she provided attendees with access to her carefully curated collection of art books. These resources offer guidance for educators seeking to infuse arts into different subjects. They steer educators away from superficial approaches &mdash; such as replacing a written report with a diorama, which can reinforce the idea that the arts are secondary or optional &mdash; and toward an approach where \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/58668/how-arts-practices-can-be-the-foundation-of-teaching-and-learning\">art is integral to the learning process\u003c/a>.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>If you&rsquo;re looking for art assignments you can do on Monday\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://valiz.nl/en/publications/wicked-arts-assignments\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wicked Arts Assignments: Practicing Creativity in Contemporary Arts Education\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a> \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">is an arts book that is applicable to teachers across disciplines, Jenkins said. Edited by Emiel Heijnen and Melissa Bremmer, this book offers insights into what makes art assignments impactful and an array of assignments crafted by arts educators across different contexts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really accessible way of understanding what an art practice can look like in a non-art classroom,&rdquo; Jenkins said.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">One assignment from the book, called &ldquo;Change the Fairytale,&rdquo; prompts students to introduce an unexpected twist in a traditional fairytale. &ldquo;Fairy tales are a shared vocabulary that many of us have around storytelling. And also, when understood today, they&rsquo;re really problematic. All sorts of bias shows up in traditional fairy tales,&rdquo; Jenkins said. This project can take various forms including a short story, comic or puppet show, but it has a natural home in an English classroom. This assignment enables students to have discussions about narrative structures, cultural interpretations and the power of storytelling to challenge established norms and perspectives.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wicked Art Assignments, \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jenkins recommended \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/draw-it-with-your-eyes-closed-the-art-of-the-art-assignment\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Draw it with Your Eyes Closed: The Art of the Art Assignment\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, edited by Paper Monument.

The book includes assignments and examples of student work. &ldquo;Her projects are very oriented towards drawing and understanding what she calls the image world. I think there&rsquo;s a lot that non-art educators can learn,&rdquo; Jenkins said. For example, Barry invites teachers to \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C6fH1uRoUbR/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">take on a new persona\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> every year and advise students to do the same.

As part of the session, she provided attendees with access to her carefully curated collection of art books. These resources offer guidance for educators seeking to infuse arts into different subjects.

And also, when understood today, they&rsquo;re really problematic. All sorts of bias shows up in traditional fairy tales,&rdquo; Jenkins said. This project can take various forms including a short story, comic or puppet show, but it has a natural home in an English classroom.

And that&rsquo;s a major reason why middle and high school teachers don&rsquo;t assign more writing to their students. Even an efficient high school English teacher who can read and evaluate an essay in 20 minutes would spend 3,000 minutes, or 50 hours, grading if she&rsquo;s teaching six classes of 25 students each. There aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Could ChatGPT relieve teachers of some of the burden of grading papers? Early research is finding that the new \u003ca href=\"https://kqed.org/mindshift/tag/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence\u003c/a> of large language models, also known as generative AI, is approaching the accuracy of a human in scoring essays and is likely to become even better soon. But we still don&rsquo;t know whether offloading essay grading to ChatGPT will ultimately improve or harm student writing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tamara Tate, a researcher at University California, Irvine, and an associate director of her university&rsquo;s Digital Learning Lab, is studying how teachers might use ChatGPT to improve writing instruction. Most recently, Tate and her seven-member research team, which includes writing expert Steve Graham at Arizona State University, compared how ChatGPT stacked up against humans in scoring 1,800 history and English essays written by middle and high school students.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate said ChatGPT was &ldquo;roughly speaking, probably as good as an average busy teacher&rdquo; and &ldquo;certainly as good as an overburdened below-average teacher.&rdquo; But, she said, ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t yet accurate enough to be used on a high-stakes test or on an essay that would affect a final grade in a class.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate presented her \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/7xpre\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">study on ChatGPT essay scoring\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in Philadelphia in April. (The paper is under peer review for publication and is still undergoing revision.)&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most remarkably, the researchers obtained these fairly decent essay scores from ChatGPT without training it first with sample essays. That means it is possible for any teacher to use it to grade any essay instantly with minimal expense and effort. &ldquo;Teachers might have more bandwidth to assign more writing,&rdquo; said Tate. &ldquo;You have to be careful how you say that because you never want to take teachers out of the loop.&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Writing instruction could ultimately suffer, Tate warned, if teachers delegate too much grading to ChatGPT. Seeing students&rsquo; incremental progress and common mistakes remain important for deciding what to teach next, she said. For example, seeing loads of run-on sentences in your students&rsquo; papers might prompt a lesson on how to break them up. But if you don&rsquo;t see them, you might not think to teach it.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the study, Tate and her research team calculated that ChatGPT&rsquo;s essay scores were in &ldquo;fair&rdquo; to &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; agreement with those of well-trained human evaluators. In one batch of 943 essays, ChatGPT was within a point of the human grader 89% of the time. On a six-point grading scale that researchers used in the study, ChatGPT often gave an essay a 2 when an expert human evaluator thought it was really a 1. But this level of agreement &ndash; within one point &ndash; dropped to 83% of the time in another batch of 344 English papers and slid even farther to 76% of the time in a third batch of 493 history essays. That means there were more instances where ChatGPT gave an essay a 4, for example, when a teacher marked it a 6. And that&rsquo;s why Tate says these ChatGPT grades should only be used for low-stakes purposes in a classroom, such as a preliminary grade on a first draft.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>ChatGPT scored an essay within one point of a human grader 89% of the time in one batch of essays\u003c/b>\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_63815\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 780px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63815\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1.png 780w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1-160x55.png 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1-768x265.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Corpus 3 refers to one batch of 943 essays, which represents more than half of the 1,800 essays that were scored in this study.

Exact agreement, which only happens half the time between human raters, was worse for AI, which matched the human score exactly only about 40% of the time. Humans were far more likely to give a top grade of a 6 or a bottom grade of a 1. ChatGPT tended to cluster grades more in the middle, between 2 and 5.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate set up ChatGPT for a tough challenge, competing against teachers and experts with PhDs who had received three hours of training in how to properly evaluate essays. &ldquo;Teachers generally receive very little training in secondary school writing and they&rsquo;re not going to be this accurate,&rdquo; said Tate. &ldquo;This is a gold-standard human evaluator we have here.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The raters had been paid to score these 1,800 essays as part of three earlier studies on student writing. Researchers fed these same student essays &ndash; ungraded &ndash;&nbsp; into ChatGPT and asked ChatGPT to score them cold. ChatGPT hadn&rsquo;t been given any graded examples to calibrate its scores. All the researchers did was copy and paste an excerpt of the same scoring guidelines that the humans used, called a grading rubric, into ChatGPT and told it to &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; it was a teacher and score the essays on a scale of 1 to 6.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Older robo graders\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earlier versions of automated essay graders have had \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.ets.org/content/dam/ets-org/pdfs/e-rater/e-rater-research-publications.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">higher rates of accuracy\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. But they were expensive and time-consuming to create because scientists had to train the computer with hundreds of human-graded essays for each essay question. That&rsquo;s economically feasible only in limited situations, such as for a standardized test, where thousands of students answer the same essay question.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earlier robo graders could also be gamed, once a student understood the features that the computer system was grading for. In some cases, nonsense essays received high marks if fancy \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.lornacollier.com/robogradingCC912.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">vocabulary words\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were sprinkled in them. ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t grading for particular hallmarks, but is analyzing patterns in massive datasets of language. Tate says she hasn&rsquo;t yet seen ChatGPT give a high score to a nonsense essay.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate expects ChatGPT&rsquo;s grading accuracy to improve rapidly as new versions are released. Already, the research team has detected that the newer 4.0 version, which requires a paid subscription, is scoring more accurately than the free 3.5 version. Tate suspects that small tweaks to the grading instructions, or prompts, given to ChatGPT could improve existing versions. She is interested in testing whether ChatGPT&rsquo;s scoring could become more reliable if a teacher trained it with just a few, perhaps five, sample essays that she has already graded. &ldquo;Your average teacher might be willing to do that,&rdquo; said Tate.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many ed tech startups, and even well-known vendors of educational materials, are now marketing \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.essaygrader.ai/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">new AI essay robo graders\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to schools.

Tate advises teachers and school leaders who are considering using an AI essay grader to ask specific questions about accuracy rates on the student level:\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp; \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is the rate of exact agreement between the AI grader and a human rater on each essay?

She&rsquo;d like teachers to try using ChatGPT to score a first draft and then see if it encourages revisions, which are critical for improving writing. Tate thinks teachers could make it &ldquo;almost like a game: how do I get my score up?&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, it&rsquo;s unclear if grades alone, without concrete feedback or suggestions for improvement, will motivate students to make revisions. Students may be discouraged by a low score from ChatGPT and give up. Many students might ignore a machine grade and only want to deal with a human they know. Still, Tate says some students are too scared to show their writing to a teacher until it&rsquo;s in decent shape, and seeing their score improve on ChatGPT might be just the kind of positive feedback they need.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">&ldquo;We know that a lot of students aren&rsquo;t doing any revision,&rdquo; said Tate. &ldquo;If we can get them to look at their paper again, that is already a win.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">That does give me hope, but I&rsquo;m also worried that kids will just ask ChatGPT to write the whole essay for them in the first place.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">This story about \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-ai-essay-grading/\">\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI essay scoring\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003c/a> \u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">was written by Jill Barshay and produced by \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/higher-education/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Hechinger Report\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

And that&rsquo;s a major reason why middle and high school teachers don&rsquo;t assign more writing to their students. Even an efficient high school English teacher who can read and evaluate an essay in 20 minutes would spend 3,000 minutes, or 50 hours, grading if she&rsquo;s teaching six classes of 25 students each. There aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Could ChatGPT relieve teachers of some of the burden of grading papers? Early research is finding that the new \u003ca href=\"https://kqed.org/mindshift/tag/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence\u003c/a> of large language models, also known as generative AI, is approaching the accuracy of a human in scoring essays and is likely to become even better soon. But we still don&rsquo;t know whether offloading essay grading to ChatGPT will ultimately improve or harm student writing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tamara Tate, a researcher at University California, Irvine, and an associate director of her university&rsquo;s Digital Learning Lab, is studying how teachers might use ChatGPT to improve writing instruction. Most recently, Tate and her seven-member research team, which includes writing expert Steve Graham at Arizona State University, compared how ChatGPT stacked up against humans in scoring 1,800 history and English essays written by middle and high school students.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate said ChatGPT was &ldquo;roughly speaking, probably as good as an average busy teacher&rdquo; and &ldquo;certainly as good as an overburdened below-average teacher.&rdquo; But, she said, ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t yet accurate enough to be used on a high-stakes test or on an essay that would affect a final grade in a class.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate presented her \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/7xpre\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">study on ChatGPT essay scoring\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in Philadelphia in April. (The paper is under peer review for publication and is still undergoing revision.)&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most remarkably, the researchers obtained these fairly decent essay scores from ChatGPT without training it first with sample essays. That means it is possible for any teacher to use it to grade any essay instantly with minimal expense and effort. &ldquo;Teachers might have more bandwidth to assign more writing,&rdquo; said Tate. &ldquo;You have to be careful how you say that because you never want to take teachers out of the loop.&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Writing instruction could ultimately suffer, Tate warned, if teachers delegate too much grading to ChatGPT. Seeing students&rsquo; incremental progress and common mistakes remain important for deciding what to teach next, she said. For example, seeing loads of run-on sentences in your students&rsquo; papers might prompt a lesson on how to break them up. But if you don&rsquo;t see them, you might not think to teach it.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the study, Tate and her research team calculated that ChatGPT&rsquo;s essay scores were in &ldquo;fair&rdquo; to &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; agreement with those of well-trained human evaluators. In one batch of 943 essays, ChatGPT was within a point of the human grader 89% of the time. On a six-point grading scale that researchers used in the study, ChatGPT often gave an essay a 2 when an expert human evaluator thought it was really a 1. But this level of agreement &ndash; within one point &ndash; dropped to 83% of the time in another batch of 344 English papers and slid even farther to 76% of the time in a third batch of 493 history essays. That means there were more instances where ChatGPT gave an essay a 4, for example, when a teacher marked it a 6. And that&rsquo;s why Tate says these ChatGPT grades should only be used for low-stakes purposes in a classroom, such as a preliminary grade on a first draft.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb>ChatGPT scored an essay within one point of a human grader 89% of the time in one batch of essays\u003c/b>\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_63815\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 780px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-63815\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1.png 780w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1-160x55.png 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/image1-1-768x265.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Corpus 3 refers to one batch of 943 essays, which represents more than half of the 1,800 essays that were scored in this study.

Exact agreement, which only happens half the time between human raters, was worse for AI, which matched the human score exactly only about 40% of the time. Humans were far more likely to give a top grade of a 6 or a bottom grade of a 1. ChatGPT tended to cluster grades more in the middle, between 2 and 5.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate set up ChatGPT for a tough challenge, competing against teachers and experts with PhDs who had received three hours of training in how to properly evaluate essays. &ldquo;Teachers generally receive very little training in secondary school writing and they&rsquo;re not going to be this accurate,&rdquo; said Tate. &ldquo;This is a gold-standard human evaluator we have here.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The raters had been paid to score these 1,800 essays as part of three earlier studies on student writing. Researchers fed these same student essays &ndash; ungraded &ndash;&nbsp; into ChatGPT and asked ChatGPT to score them cold. ChatGPT hadn&rsquo;t been given any graded examples to calibrate its scores. All the researchers did was copy and paste an excerpt of the same scoring guidelines that the humans used, called a grading rubric, into ChatGPT and told it to &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; it was a teacher and score the essays on a scale of 1 to 6.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Older robo graders\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earlier versions of automated essay graders have had \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.ets.org/content/dam/ets-org/pdfs/e-rater/e-rater-research-publications.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">higher rates of accuracy\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. But they were expensive and time-consuming to create because scientists had to train the computer with hundreds of human-graded essays for each essay question. That&rsquo;s economically feasible only in limited situations, such as for a standardized test, where thousands of students answer the same essay question.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Earlier robo graders could also be gamed, once a student understood the features that the computer system was grading for. In some cases, nonsense essays received high marks if fancy \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.lornacollier.com/robogradingCC912.pdf\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">vocabulary words\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were sprinkled in them. ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t grading for particular hallmarks, but is analyzing patterns in massive datasets of language. Tate says she hasn&rsquo;t yet seen ChatGPT give a high score to a nonsense essay.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tate expects ChatGPT&rsquo;s grading accuracy to improve rapidly as new versions are released. Already, the research team has detected that the newer 4.0 version, which requires a paid subscription, is scoring more accurately than the free 3.5 version. Tate suspects that small tweaks to the grading instructions, or prompts, given to ChatGPT could improve existing versions. She is interested in testing whether ChatGPT&rsquo;s scoring could become more reliable if a teacher trained it with just a few, perhaps five, sample essays that she has already graded. &ldquo;Your average teacher might be willing to do that,&rdquo; said Tate.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many ed tech startups, and even well-known vendors of educational materials, are now marketing \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.essaygrader.ai/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">new AI essay robo graders\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to schools.

It&rsquo;s a cold December morning and she&rsquo;s wearing gold and black Nikes and a gray hoodie, pulled up.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She&rsquo;s surrounded by school staff and her mom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I just wanna be really clear about the intention of this meeting. It&rsquo;s not to make you feel bad,&rdquo; says Dave, a school administrator.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asks Neomi. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t we coming to school? Because you were coming to school quite a bit, and then all of a sudden&hellip;&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Neomi listens, tears roll down her cheeks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Do you not feel safe? Are you stressed?&rdquo; Dave asks softly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, in a quiet voice, the teen says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have friends. I don&rsquo;t have any people.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi has been chronically absent, which means, at the time of this meeting, she had already missed 10% or more of the school year. The teen is part of an alarming trend among the country&rsquo;s K-12 students.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chronic absenteeism skyrocketed nationwide during the pandemic. In the 2022-23 academic year, 26% of U.S. students were chronically absent, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/long-covid-for-public-schools-chronic-absenteeism-before-and-after-the-pandemic/\">research from the American Enterprise Institute\u003c/a> (AEI). Before the pandemic, only 15% of students were regularly missing school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In some places, like Colorado and Oregon, the rates of chronic absenteeism are even higher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Research has shown there&rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chronic-absenteeism-an-old-problem-in-search-of-new-answers/\">link between\u003c/a> irregular attendance and not graduating &ndash; and attendance \u003ca href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/chronicabsenteeism.html\">can be a better predictor\u003c/a> of a student&rsquo;s drop-out risk than test scores.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The flip side of it [is] kids with high attendance are much more likely to stay on track and graduate with their peers,&rdquo; says Johann Liljengren, director of dropout prevention for the Colorado Department of Education.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Going beyond academics to help solve absenteeism\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Getting chronically absent students back to class is a priority for schools. It requires support from families and teachers, as well as difficult, personal conversations &ndash; like the kind Dave and Neomi are having in Colorado.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>NPR is only using the teen&rsquo;s middle name so this conversation about her attendance doesn&rsquo;t hurt future job or academic prospects. To further protect her identity, we aren&rsquo;t naming her school or her mom, and we&rsquo;re only using the administrator&rsquo;s first name.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi and her family came to Colorado from El Salvador. At the December meeting, a school staffer interprets for Neomi&rsquo;s mom, who has been listening quietly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Dave points out that the teen hasn&rsquo;t been in school much since Thanksgiving, Neomi&rsquo;s mom speaks up to explain what her daughter has been going through.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to come here because she was dating this kid and they broke up,&rdquo; she says through the interpreter. &ldquo;Everybody is bullying or laughing or talking: &lsquo;Well, after being the perfect couple, look at you.&rsquo; &rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi&rsquo;s mom tried to get help for her daughter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I was trying to find resources to try to find a therapist,&rdquo; she says through the interpreter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dave tells her he can help with that. He knows, through student interviews, that health, including mental health, was among the top reasons around half of all students in this rural district were chronically absent during the 2022-23 school year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other reasons include family responsibilities, transportation issues and jobs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;So everything from working at, you know, Walmart to helping parents with their cleaning businesses,&rdquo; Dave explains. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re working till really late at night. And then, you know, getting up in the morning is tough.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For Neomi, the hardest part of coming to school is running into students in the hallways and at lunchtime. With this key information, staffers get to work on some solutions that could help bring the teenager back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They offer to give her a pass to leave class early so she can avoid the students who have been teasing her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dave suggests finding a classroom where she can eat lunch, and school staff offer to stay in touch over a messaging app.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They try to get Neomi to stay for the rest of the school day, but she says she isn&rsquo;t ready. Though she promises to come back on Monday, after the weekend.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>What it looks like to come back from absenteeism\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Anais and her mom agree Anais&rsquo; sophomore year was a low point in her high school career: She missed more than a month of classes, which set her back academically and put her at risk of not graduating on time, a common consequence of chronic absenteeism \u003ca href=\"https://www.ode.state.or.us/wma/researchschool-attendance--final-version.pdf\">in Oregon\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anais is currently a junior at David Douglas High School in southeast Portland, Ore. On a Friday after school back in February, the bubbly 17-year-old and her mom, Josette, are outside, in front of their apartment complex, joking around.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She and her mom go back and forth on how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette gives her daughter a D.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;From January to June, you were not there a lot,&rdquo; she says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anais is harder on herself: &ldquo;I would say a D-minus.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last school year, Anais was sick a lot, but, like Neomi, she was also going through a breakup. Both kept her from school for days at a time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>NPR is not using Anais&rsquo; full name so she can talk openly about her attendance without hurting future academic or job prospects. To further protect her identity, we also aren&rsquo;t fully naming her mom, Josette.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chronic absenteeism at Anais&rsquo; high school was at 44% in 2023, well above AEI&rsquo;s national average.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For Anais, missing so much school hurt her grades and changed her friendships. She says her teachers tried to help &ndash; &ldquo;The teachers really did try their best with me with not showing up&rdquo; &mdash; but there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this year has been different. Her attendance is back up, and Anais has been working on her grades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What changed? She hasn&rsquo;t been sick as much this year &ndash; and she also got back together with her boyfriend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette doesn&rsquo;t love that the boyfriend continues to play a role in her daughter&rsquo;s attendance. She&rsquo;s quick to remind Anais that school is a priority.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I do talk to her about not letting things get in the way of her education,&rdquo; Josette says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After so many absences, getting back on track to graduate goes beyond just showing up. Anais has been taking a credit recovery class after school to make up for what she missed during her sophomore year. She plans to attend summer school too, if that&rsquo;s what it takes to finish on time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette has faith her daughter will pull it off. If she does, Anais would be the first of her five siblings to graduate from a traditional high school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At that point, Anais jokes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty much a grown adult.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Back on track\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>One thing both Anais and her mom can agree on is how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance \u003cem>this \u003c/em>school year: Both give it an A.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the school year winds down in Colorado, Neomi&rsquo;s attendance has also turned around. Dave says she missed school the Monday after the meeting, but she did make it on Tuesday. Since then, she&rsquo;s been coming to school a lot more. Recently the teenager had a two-week stretch of perfect attendance.

Getting them back in the classroom takes support from both school and faculty. And for many teenagers, it also takes a real desire to go back. OPB&rsquo;s Elizabeth Miller spoke to one teen in Portland, Ore., about her journey to better attendance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ELIZABETH MILLER, BYLINE: This is Anais.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: And I go to David Douglas High School, and I&rsquo;m a 11th grader, so I&rsquo;m a junior. (Laughter) I had to process that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: Last year, Anais really struggled to make it to school. We aren&rsquo;t using Anais&rsquo; full name, so she can talk openly about her attendance without hurting future academic or job prospects. To further protect her identity, we also aren&rsquo;t fully naming her mom, Josette.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JOSETTE: Your attendance last year was not all that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: At home, Anais and Josette go back and forth on how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance back then. Josette said she&rsquo;d give her daughter a D. Anais is less generous.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: I&rsquo;d say a D-minus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JOSETTE: OK. January to June&hellip;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: I&rsquo;d say a D-minus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JOSETTE: &hellip;You were not there a lot.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: Like countless teenage daughters and mothers before them, neither will budge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying a D-minus&hellip;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JOSETTE: OK, a D-minus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: &hellip;Not a D-plus.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: Chronic absenteeism exploded during the pandemic. And the numbers are still pretty bad. In 2023, about 1 in 4 U.S. students was chronically absent, according to research from the American Enterprise Institute. That means they&rsquo;ve missed 10% or more of the school year. In Oregon, the numbers are even worse. About 200,000 Oregon students were chronically absent last school year. Anais was one of them.

It&rsquo;s not to make you feel bad,&rdquo; says Dave, a school administrator.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; he asks Neomi. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t we coming to school? Because you were coming to school quite a bit, and then all of a sudden&hellip;&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Neomi listens, tears roll down her cheeks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Do you not feel safe? Are you stressed?&rdquo; Dave asks softly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, in a quiet voice, the teen says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have friends. I don&rsquo;t have any people.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi has been chronically absent, which means, at the time of this meeting, she had already missed 10% or more of the school year. The teen is part of an alarming trend among the country&rsquo;s K-12 students.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chronic absenteeism skyrocketed nationwide during the pandemic. In the 2022-23 academic year, 26% of U.S. students were chronically absent, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/long-covid-for-public-schools-chronic-absenteeism-before-and-after-the-pandemic/\">research from the American Enterprise Institute\u003c/a> (AEI). Before the pandemic, only 15% of students were regularly missing school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In some places, like Colorado and Oregon, the rates of chronic absenteeism are even higher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Research has shown there&rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chronic-absenteeism-an-old-problem-in-search-of-new-answers/\">link between\u003c/a> irregular attendance and not graduating &ndash; and attendance \u003ca href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/chronicabsenteeism.html\">can be a better predictor\u003c/a> of a student&rsquo;s drop-out risk than test scores.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The flip side of it [is] kids with high attendance are much more likely to stay on track and graduate with their peers,&rdquo; says Johann Liljengren, director of dropout prevention for the Colorado Department of Education.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Going beyond academics to help solve absenteeism\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Getting chronically absent students back to class is a priority for schools. It requires support from families and teachers, as well as difficult, personal conversations &ndash; like the kind Dave and Neomi are having in Colorado.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>NPR is only using the teen&rsquo;s middle name so this conversation about her attendance doesn&rsquo;t hurt future job or academic prospects. To further protect her identity, we aren&rsquo;t naming her school or her mom, and we&rsquo;re only using the administrator&rsquo;s first name.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi and her family came to Colorado from El Salvador. At the December meeting, a school staffer interprets for Neomi&rsquo;s mom, who has been listening quietly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Dave points out that the teen hasn&rsquo;t been in school much since Thanksgiving, Neomi&rsquo;s mom speaks up to explain what her daughter has been going through.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to come here because she was dating this kid and they broke up,&rdquo; she says through the interpreter. &ldquo;Everybody is bullying or laughing or talking: &lsquo;Well, after being the perfect couple, look at you.&rsquo; &rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Neomi&rsquo;s mom tried to get help for her daughter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I was trying to find resources to try to find a therapist,&rdquo; she says through the interpreter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dave tells her he can help with that. He knows, through student interviews, that health, including mental health, was among the top reasons around half of all students in this rural district were chronically absent during the 2022-23 school year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other reasons include family responsibilities, transportation issues and jobs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;So everything from working at, you know, Walmart to helping parents with their cleaning businesses,&rdquo; Dave explains. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re working till really late at night. And then, you know, getting up in the morning is tough.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For Neomi, the hardest part of coming to school is running into students in the hallways and at lunchtime. With this key information, staffers get to work on some solutions that could help bring the teenager back.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They offer to give her a pass to leave class early so she can avoid the students who have been teasing her.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dave suggests finding a classroom where she can eat lunch, and school staff offer to stay in touch over a messaging app.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They try to get Neomi to stay for the rest of the school day, but she says she isn&rsquo;t ready. Though she promises to come back on Monday, after the weekend.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>What it looks like to come back from absenteeism\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Anais and her mom agree Anais&rsquo; sophomore year was a low point in her high school career: She missed more than a month of classes, which set her back academically and put her at risk of not graduating on time, a common consequence of chronic absenteeism \u003ca href=\"https://www.ode.state.or.us/wma/researchschool-attendance--final-version.pdf\">in Oregon\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anais is currently a junior at David Douglas High School in southeast Portland, Ore. On a Friday after school back in February, the bubbly 17-year-old and her mom, Josette, are outside, in front of their apartment complex, joking around.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She and her mom go back and forth on how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette gives her daughter a D.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;From January to June, you were not there a lot,&rdquo; she says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Anais is harder on herself: &ldquo;I would say a D-minus.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last school year, Anais was sick a lot, but, like Neomi, she was also going through a breakup. Both kept her from school for days at a time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>NPR is not using Anais&rsquo; full name so she can talk openly about her attendance without hurting future academic or job prospects. To further protect her identity, we also aren&rsquo;t fully naming her mom, Josette.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chronic absenteeism at Anais&rsquo; high school was at 44% in 2023, well above AEI&rsquo;s national average.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For Anais, missing so much school hurt her grades and changed her friendships. She says her teachers tried to help &ndash; &ldquo;The teachers really did try their best with me with not showing up&rdquo; &mdash; but there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But this year has been different. Her attendance is back up, and Anais has been working on her grades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What changed? She hasn&rsquo;t been sick as much this year &ndash; and she also got back together with her boyfriend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette doesn&rsquo;t love that the boyfriend continues to play a role in her daughter&rsquo;s attendance. She&rsquo;s quick to remind Anais that school is a priority.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I do talk to her about not letting things get in the way of her education,&rdquo; Josette says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After so many absences, getting back on track to graduate goes beyond just showing up. Anais has been taking a credit recovery class after school to make up for what she missed during her sophomore year. She plans to attend summer school too, if that&rsquo;s what it takes to finish on time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Josette has faith her daughter will pull it off. If she does, Anais would be the first of her five siblings to graduate from a traditional high school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At that point, Anais jokes, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty much a grown adult.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Back on track\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>One thing both Anais and her mom can agree on is how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance \u003cem>this \u003c/em>school year: Both give it an A.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As the school year winds down in Colorado, Neomi&rsquo;s attendance has also turned around. Dave says she missed school the Monday after the meeting, but she did make it on Tuesday. Since then, she&rsquo;s been coming to school a lot more.

Getting them back in the classroom takes support from both school and faculty. And for many teenagers, it also takes a real desire to go back.

We aren&rsquo;t using Anais&rsquo; full name, so she can talk openly about her attendance without hurting future academic or job prospects. To further protect her identity, we also aren&rsquo;t fully naming her mom, Josette.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>JOSETTE: Your attendance last year was not all that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: At home, Anais and Josette go back and forth on how they&rsquo;d grade Anais&rsquo; attendance back then.

And the numbers are still pretty bad. In 2023, about 1 in 4 U.S. students was chronically absent, according to research from the American Enterprise Institute. That means they&rsquo;ve missed 10% or more of the school year. In Oregon, the numbers are even worse. About 200,000 Oregon students were chronically absent last school year. Anais was one of them. She says she was sick a lot.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: Last year, it was more of being around &ndash; like, a lot of sick people don&rsquo;t give it up (laughter).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>MILLER: Judging from her mom&rsquo;s reaction, that wasn&rsquo;t the whole story.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ANAIS: What&rsquo;s that look for?

In 2023, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.naesp.org/blog/funding-falls-short-for-students-with-disabilities/#:~:text=From%20its%20inception%2C%20IDEA%20authorized,to%20provide%20special%20education%20services.\">National Association of Elementary School Principals said\u003c/a>, &ldquo;Since the law was enacted, the closest the federal government has come to reaching the 40 percent commitment was 18 percent in 2004-2006, and current funding is at less than 13 percent.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All this leaves Melony Lenover chafing at what she considers a double standard for children with disabilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;d been one of my typically-functioning kids who are not in school for two months, [the school district] would be coming after me,&rdquo; Lenover says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In many places, a child who has missed about 18 school days &ndash; far less than Emma &ndash; is considered chronically absent. It&rsquo;s a crisis that triggers a range of emergency interventions.

On a recent Thursday, she sits at her kitchen table, her back to a refrigerator covered with family photos. She grips her phone hard, like a lifeline, watching old videos of her son, Shawn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The cell phone videos show a young boy with a broad smile, being urged by his mother to pull up his socks. Or being taught by his doting sister to ride a scooter. Or dressed up for what appears to be a wedding, and doing the chicken dance. He is a joyful kid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Much has changed since then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shawn is a pseudonym, chosen by Vang and his attorneys in the lawsuit. We&rsquo;re not using his real name because Shawn is a minor and his mother asked us to protect his identity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To understand Shawn&rsquo;s role in the lawsuit &ndash; and the depths of Del Norte&rsquo;s staffing crisis &ndash; you have to understand what happened to him on Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2023.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He was 15 at the time. Shawn has autism and is nonverbal, and as part of his special education plan, he gets his own, dedicated aide at school. But again, because of Del Norte&rsquo;s struggles to hire enough special education staff, those aides are often in short supply and undertrained.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shawn&rsquo;s lead teacher that day, Brittany Wyckoff, says, when he grew frustrated in class, his fill-in aide did not follow procedure. It was snack time, but &ldquo;this staff said, &lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re not being calm&rsquo; and pulled [the snack] away. So that wasn&rsquo;t the appropriate way to handle it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another staff member later told police Shawn had begun to calm down, but the aide still wouldn&rsquo;t give him the snack &ndash; pistachios. Instead, Wyckoff says, the aide used a firm tone and continued telling Shawn to calm down. Shawn got more agitated, hitting himself in the face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The aide later told police he began to worry Shawn might try to bite him &ndash; because Shawn had bitten other staff before. Witnesses told police he warned Shawn, &ldquo;You will not bite me. You will not bite me.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wyckoff says standard procedure, when a student gets agitated and potentially violent, is to move classroom furniture &ndash; a table, a desk &ndash; between your body and the student. Instead, Wyckoff says, this aide moved furniture out of the way. When Shawn moved toward the aide, unobstructed, the aide raised his hands.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The staff member just instantly reached out and choked [Shawn],&rdquo; Wyckoff remembers. &ldquo;And full-on, like one hand over the other hand choke.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Multiple staff told police, Shawn had not tried to bite the aide. Wyckoff says she was yelling at the aide to stop and finally pulled him off of Shawn, &ldquo;who was turning purple.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>How the incident led to missed school\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>The aide left school after choking Shawn and went to a local bar for a beer, according to the police report. He later told police he&rsquo;d acted in self-defense. When he was arrested, for child endangerment, and asked why he hadn&rsquo;t called police himself, the aide said, because he&rsquo;d been in many similar situations and didn&rsquo;t think this rose to that level.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The district attorney ultimately chose not to file charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_63803\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 700px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63803 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2.jpeg 700w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2-160x120.jpeg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emma, left, works with her sister, Kelsey Mercer, to join one of her favorite school classes, dance, from home. \u003ccite>(Cory Turner/NPR)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Linda Vang says the incident changed Shawn. He became less trusting and was scared to return to the classroom. &ldquo;It is the hardest thing in my life to watch my son go through this.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To make matters worse, after the incident, the school couldn&rsquo;t provide Shawn with a new aide, and, like Emma Lenover, he couldn&rsquo;t do school without one. After the encounter, he was forced to miss two months of school &ndash; because of the staffing crisis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It was just week after week, them telling us, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no staff.

It&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Again, Superintendent Jeff Harris can&rsquo;t comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, or on the incident involving Shawn, but he defends the district.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t come in everyday going, &lsquo;How can we mess with people&rsquo;s lives?&rsquo; We come in every day going, &lsquo;What can we do \u003cem>today\u003c/em> to make this work?&rsquo; &rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shawn, like Emma, lost skills during his time away from school.

He even likes the aide he has now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It has been very hard the last year. But you know, we&rsquo;re getting there.

The stakes are just too high.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Superintendent Harris says the district does provide staff training, but he also has to balance that with the need to get staff into classrooms quickly.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Veteran special education staff in Del Norte tell NPR they&rsquo;ve seen what happens when students with disabilities don&rsquo;t get consistent, quality support: They lose skills.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;One particular student, he was doing well,&rdquo; says Emily Caldwell, a speech-language pathologist in the district. &ldquo;We were talking about removing his communication device from coming to school because he&rsquo;s communicating verbally.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Caldwell works with many students who, like Shawn and Emma, use a communication device. This student, though, had been learning to use his own voice. It was a big deal, Caldwell says.

In 2023, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.naesp.org/blog/funding-falls-short-for-students-with-disabilities/#:~:text=From%20its%20inception%2C%20IDEA%20authorized,to%20provide%20special%20education%20services.\">National Association of Elementary School Principals said\u003c/a>, &ldquo;Since the law was enacted, the closest the federal government has come to reaching the 40 percent commitment was 18 percent in 2004-2006, and current funding is at less than 13 percent.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All this leaves Melony Lenover chafing at what she considers a double standard for children with disabilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;d been one of my typically-functioning kids who are not in school for two months, [the school district] would be coming after me,&rdquo; Lenover says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In many places, a child who has missed about 18 school days &ndash; far less than Emma &ndash; is considered chronically absent. It&rsquo;s a crisis that triggers a range of emergency interventions. Lenover says Emma&rsquo;s absences weren&rsquo;t treated with nearly the same urgency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Emma Lenover still doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated aide, she is finally getting help.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We said as a team, enough is enough,&rdquo; says Sarah Elston, who is Emma&rsquo;s special education teacher. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna do whatever it takes to get this girl an education.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Elston has been working with her high school principal to patch together as much help as they can for Emma, including shifting a classroom aide to help Emma participate remotely in one of her favorite classes, dance.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>How the staffing shortage can become dangerous\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Linda Vang is another plaintiff in the Del Norte lawsuit, alongside Emma Lenover&rsquo;s parents. On a recent Thursday, she sits at her kitchen table, her back to a refrigerator covered with family photos. She grips her phone hard, like a lifeline, watching old videos of her son, Shawn.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The cell phone videos show a young boy with a broad smile, being urged by his mother to pull up his socks. Or being taught by his doting sister to ride a scooter. Or dressed up for what appears to be a wedding, and doing the chicken dance. He is a joyful kid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Much has changed since then.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shawn is a pseudonym, chosen by Vang and his attorneys in the lawsuit. We&rsquo;re not using his real name because Shawn is a minor and his mother asked us to protect his identity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To understand Shawn&rsquo;s role in the lawsuit &ndash; and the depths of Del Norte&rsquo;s staffing crisis &ndash; you have to understand what happened to him on Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2023.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He was 15 at the time. Shawn has autism and is nonverbal, and as part of his special education plan, he gets his own, dedicated aide at school. But again, because of Del Norte&rsquo;s struggles to hire enough special education staff, those aides are often in short supply and undertrained.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Shawn&rsquo;s lead teacher that day, Brittany Wyckoff, says, when he grew frustrated in class, his fill-in aide did not follow procedure. It was snack time, but &ldquo;this staff said, &lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re not being calm&rsquo; and pulled [the snack] away. So that wasn&rsquo;t the appropriate way to handle it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another staff member later told police Shawn had begun to calm down, but the aide still wouldn&rsquo;t give him the snack &ndash; pistachios. Instead, Wyckoff says, the aide used a firm tone and continued telling Shawn to calm down. Shawn got more agitated, hitting himself in the face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The aide later told police he began to worry Shawn might try to bite him &ndash; because Shawn had bitten other staff before. Witnesses told police he warned Shawn, &ldquo;You will not bite me. You will not bite me.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Wyckoff says standard procedure, when a student gets agitated and potentially violent, is to move classroom furniture &ndash; a table, a desk &ndash; between your body and the student. Instead, Wyckoff says, this aide moved furniture out of the way. When Shawn moved toward the aide, unobstructed, the aide raised his hands.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The staff member just instantly reached out and choked [Shawn],&rdquo; Wyckoff remembers. &ldquo;And full-on, like one hand over the other hand choke.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Multiple staff told police, Shawn had not tried to bite the aide. Wyckoff says she was yelling at the aide to stop and finally pulled him off of Shawn, &ldquo;who was turning purple.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>How the incident led to missed school\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>The aide left school after choking Shawn and went to a local bar for a beer, according to the police report. He later told police he&rsquo;d acted in self-defense. When he was arrested, for child endangerment, and asked why he hadn&rsquo;t called police himself, the aide said, because he&rsquo;d been in many similar situations and didn&rsquo;t think this rose to that level.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The district attorney ultimately chose not to file charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_63803\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 700px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-63803 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2.jpeg 700w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/sped2-160x120.jpeg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emma, left, works with her sister, Kelsey Mercer, to join one of her favorite school classes, dance, from home. \u003ccite>(Cory Turner/NPR)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Linda Vang says the incident changed Shawn.

From his own teaching experience, Sam Finn, who is currently director of Newcomer Policy and Practice at \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://californianstogether.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Californians Together\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, said that \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61254/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-teacher-shortages-and-what-can-be-done-about-them\">burnout\u003c/a> happens when educators are forced to overextend their time in the classroom to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60104/how-to-structure-academic-math-conversations-to-support-english-learners\">accommodate newcomers\u003c/a> in a system that does not prioritize those students. According to Melendez, &ldquo;Educators are at the center of what can be done, but they need the support and the connections and the ability to network because they \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/56836/how-teachers-are-leaning-on-each-other-to-stay-resilient-during-covid-19\">can&rsquo;t do it alone\u003c/a>.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Teachers with newcomer students in their classroom need to receive proper professional support in order to effectively welcome these students. Although English language acquisition has traditionally been the data marker for newcomer student success, \u003ca href=\"https://www.jessicalander.com/about-jessica\">Jessica Lander\u003c/a>, a high school teacher and author of \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710947/making-americans-by-jessica-lander/\">Making Americans\u003c/a>,\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> wants to see the definition of newcomers&rsquo; academic success broaden.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Melendez, Lander and Finn, developing school-wide intake systems and creating support networks for educators are two ways schools can support teachers so they can support newcomer students.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Expanding the definition of newcomer students\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Historically, a newcomer student has been defined as any immigrant who has arrived in the U.S. educational system without a working knowledge of English, according to Melendez. Today that may mean a child or teenager who has refugee status or has recently arrived in the United States and been transported to a \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/18799/explainer-what-are-sanctuary-cities\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">sanctuary city\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Melendez explained. These students may or may not know English, but they have &ldquo;probably experienced quite a lot of trauma,&rdquo; and are adjusting to &ldquo;a new educational system, a new learning system, a new language,&rdquo; she continued.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lander said defining newcomer students primarily in relation to language acquisition tends to promote a deficit approach to the student&rsquo;s capacity to learn and contribute, &ldquo;and our kids internalize that.&rdquo; Teachers can also internalize deficit frameworks and lower their expectations for these students. &ldquo;I see, too often, the equating of English acquisition with intelligence,&rdquo; said Lander. &ldquo;How do we reframe how we&rsquo;re thinking about our kids in \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60088/using-a-strengths-based-approach-to-help-students-realize-their-potential\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">a strength-based model\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [and center] those things they bring versus those things they lack?&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Finn, who previously taught elementary grades in Oakland, most school districts do not collect data specifically about newcomer students beyond their inclusion in English learner data. &ldquo;On the most basic level, many districts are not really able to serve their newcomers because they don&rsquo;t even identify them as a specific group,&rdquo; Finn said. Making sure that educators are familiar with the data collection systems and definitions in their schools and districts is one way to draw attention to the population of newcomers, he added.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb style=\"font-size: 24px\">Creating school-wide intake systems\u003c/b>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">School districts don&rsquo;t have a standardized approach to intake and introduction for newcomer students beyond the first few hours at school, according to Lander. In her classroom, classmates often step into an informal mentoring role by giving newer students a building tour, accompanying them to lunch, or explaining school procedures in a more familiar language. &ldquo;One of the many strengths that I see my students bring to our classrooms is their generosity and their deep commitment to each other,&rdquo; Lander said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But individual students and educators shouldn&rsquo;t be left to create comprehensive systems of intake for newcomer students. In \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making Americans, \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lander highlighted a school with a more in-depth welcome process. At The International High School at Langley Park, Maryland, a school designed for immigrant-origin students, intake forms asks questions beyond the basics, such as:\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are some of your most positive and negative memories from school?\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What do you like to do in the afternoon?\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">When schools create intentional systems for intake and orientation of newcomer students, it lightens the individual load on students and teachers, Lander said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Creating support networks for educators\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Newcomers &ldquo;need time to, feel secure, feel safe, [and] develop a relationship with their educators and with their peers,&rdquo; said Melendez. In order to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63148/creating-a-welcoming-environment-for-linguistically-diverse-families-of-students-in-special-education\">welcome newcomer students\u003c/a> adequately, educators need to be supported in understanding the educational and social-emotional context that their newcomer students are coming from. Personnel like social workers, counselors and educators that assist with one-on-one learning can help teachers navigate curricular and cultural differences for their newcomer students.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proactive support for educators also can consist of professional development and informational sessions with local advocacy organizations where educators are allowed time to have their questions answered, Melendez said. According to Finn, the services needed to support vulnerable newcomer students are often beyond the capacity of teachers and schools to support. One way schools and districts can alleviate the overwhelm placed on individual educators is to work with community-based organizations, like \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.reftrans.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Refugee and Immigrant Transitions\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, that are dedicated to supporting these families. Finn also recommended that administrators and educators look to the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://ncela.ed.gov/educator-support/toolkits/newcomer-toolkit\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Newcomer Toolkit\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which provides professional learning and development resources, and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.calnew.net/home\">California Newcomer Network\u003c/a>, which hosts webinars focused on education practice\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">While visiting classrooms that center newcomer students across the country, Lander noticed a lack of connection between individual schools, districts, educators and organizations. One educator featured in \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making Americans\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mayra Hayes, director of English Learners in Guilford County Schools in North Carolina, provided an example of how to counter that pattern. Hayes developed a district-wide educator support network\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">As part of her programming, she created a network of English learner educators and general education teachers who might be looking for more support when it comes to their immigrant-origin students. Hayes also developed a newsletter highlighting and distributing new lessons and classroom strategies for teachers across the district.

From his own teaching experience, Sam Finn, who is currently director of Newcomer Policy and Practice at \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://californianstogether.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Californians Together\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, said that \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61254/what-we-do-and-dont-know-about-teacher-shortages-and-what-can-be-done-about-them\">burnout\u003c/a> happens when educators are forced to overextend their time in the classroom to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60104/how-to-structure-academic-math-conversations-to-support-english-learners\">accommodate newcomers\u003c/a> in a system that does not prioritize those students. According to Melendez, &ldquo;Educators are at the center of what can be done, but they need the support and the connections and the ability to network because they \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/56836/how-teachers-are-leaning-on-each-other-to-stay-resilient-during-covid-19\">can&rsquo;t do it alone\u003c/a>.&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Teachers with newcomer students in their classroom need to receive proper professional support in order to effectively welcome these students. Although English language acquisition has traditionally been the data marker for newcomer student success, \u003ca href=\"https://www.jessicalander.com/about-jessica\">Jessica Lander\u003c/a>, a high school teacher and author of \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710947/making-americans-by-jessica-lander/\">Making Americans\u003c/a>,\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> wants to see the definition of newcomers&rsquo; academic success broaden.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Melendez, Lander and Finn, developing school-wide intake systems and creating support networks for educators are two ways schools can support teachers so they can support newcomer students.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Expanding the definition of newcomer students\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Historically, a newcomer student has been defined as any immigrant who has arrived in the U.S. educational system without a working knowledge of English, according to Melendez. Today that may mean a child or teenager who has refugee status or has recently arrived in the United States and been transported to a \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/18799/explainer-what-are-sanctuary-cities\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">sanctuary city\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Melendez explained. These students may or may not know English, but they have &ldquo;probably experienced quite a lot of trauma,&rdquo; and are adjusting to &ldquo;a new educational system, a new learning system, a new language,&rdquo; she continued.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lander said defining newcomer students primarily in relation to language acquisition tends to promote a deficit approach to the student&rsquo;s capacity to learn and contribute, &ldquo;and our kids internalize that.&rdquo; Teachers can also internalize deficit frameworks and lower their expectations for these students. &ldquo;I see, too often, the equating of English acquisition with intelligence,&rdquo; said Lander. &ldquo;How do we reframe how we&rsquo;re thinking about our kids in \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60088/using-a-strengths-based-approach-to-help-students-realize-their-potential\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">a strength-based model\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [and center] those things they bring versus those things they lack?&rdquo;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Finn, who previously taught elementary grades in Oakland, most school districts do not collect data specifically about newcomer students beyond their inclusion in English learner data. &ldquo;On the most basic level, many districts are not really able to serve their newcomers because they don&rsquo;t even identify them as a specific group,&rdquo; Finn said. Making sure that educators are familiar with the data collection systems and definitions in their schools and districts is one way to draw attention to the population of newcomers, he added.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cb style=\"font-size: 24px\">Creating school-wide intake systems\u003c/b>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">School districts don&rsquo;t have a standardized approach to intake and introduction for newcomer students beyond the first few hours at school, according to Lander. In her classroom, classmates often step into an informal mentoring role by giving newer students a building tour, accompanying them to lunch, or explaining school procedures in a more familiar language. &ldquo;One of the many strengths that I see my students bring to our classrooms is their generosity and their deep commitment to each other,&rdquo; Lander said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">But individual students and educators shouldn&rsquo;t be left to create comprehensive systems of intake for newcomer students. In \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making Americans, \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lander highlighted a school with a more in-depth welcome process. At The International High School at Langley Park, Maryland, a school designed for immigrant-origin students, intake forms asks questions beyond the basics, such as:\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are some of your most positive and negative memories from school?\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">What do you like to do in the afternoon?\u003c/span>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">When schools create intentional systems for intake and orientation of newcomer students, it lightens the individual load on students and teachers, Lander said.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>Creating support networks for educators\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Newcomers &ldquo;need time to, feel secure, feel safe, [and] develop a relationship with their educators and with their peers,&rdquo; said Melendez. In order to \u003ca href=\"https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63148/creating-a-welcoming-environment-for-linguistically-diverse-families-of-students-in-special-education\">welcome newcomer students\u003c/a> adequately, educators need to be supported in understanding the educational and social-emotional context that their newcomer students are coming from. Personnel like social workers, counselors and educators that assist with one-on-one learning can help teachers navigate curricular and cultural differences for their newcomer students.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proactive support for educators also can consist of professional development and informational sessions with local advocacy organizations where educators are allowed time to have their questions answered, Melendez said. According to Finn, the services needed to support vulnerable newcomer students are often beyond the capacity of teachers and schools to support. One way schools and districts can alleviate the overwhelm placed on individual educators is to work with community-based organizations, like \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.reftrans.org/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Refugee and Immigrant Transitions\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, that are dedicated to supporting these families. Finn also recommended that administrators and educators look to the \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://ncela.ed.gov/educator-support/toolkits/newcomer-toolkit\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Newcomer Toolkit\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which provides professional learning and development resources, and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.calnew.net/home\">California Newcomer Network\u003c/a>, which hosts webinars focused on education practice\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">While visiting classrooms that center newcomer students across the country, Lander noticed a lack of connection between individual schools, districts, educators and organizations. One educator featured in \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making Americans\u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mayra Hayes, director of English Learners in Guilford County Schools in North Carolina, provided an example of how to counter that pattern. Hayes developed a district-wide educator support network\u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">As part of her programming, she created a network of English learner educators and general education teachers who might be looking for more support when it comes to their immigrant-origin students. Hayes also developed a newsletter highlighting and distributing new lessons and classroom strategies for teachers across the district. According to Lander, after these efforts, the district saw a drastic transformation of reading expectations for newcomer students, as well as improvements to district-wide test score outcomes.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">For Lander it is powerful to see other educator&rsquo;s ideas and classrooms.
