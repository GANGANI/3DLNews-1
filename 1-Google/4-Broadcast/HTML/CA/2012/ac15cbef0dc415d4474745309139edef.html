<p><a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2012/12/popular-news-stories.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5336" title="popular news stories" alt="" src="http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2012/12/popular-news-stories-300x319.png" width="210" height="223"></a>The American public's news interests were overwhelmingly focused on domestic stories this year. In fact, The U.S. consulate attack in Libya was the only foreign event that made the top 15 list, according to the<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/12/20/election-tragedies-dominate-top-stories-of-2012/" target="_blank"> Pew Research Center's News Interest Index</a>, which tracks popularity of stories on a weekly basis throughout the year. Not surprisingly, the presidential election took the number one spot, followed by the December school shooting in Connecticut. Hurricane Sandy was a close third.</p>
<p><strong>Wide interest gap among different racial and age groups<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Certain major stories had very large racial divides in interest level. Most notably, 70 percent of black adults - as compared to only 30 percent of whites - closely followed the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Meanwhile, 43 percent of whites polled felt that the Martin case received too much media coverage.</p>
<p></p></div></span><div class="components-Ad-__Ad__ad components-Ad-__Ad__ad__fullwidth"><div><div class="components-Ad-__Ad__ad_Wrapper"><span class="components-Ad-__Ad__ad_Label">Sponsored</span><div class="components-Ad-__Ad__ad_Img"></div></div></div></div><span class=""><div class="post-body"><p></p>
<p>There were also a number of large age-related interest gaps in the year's top stories. The interest level among people over 50 in the Supreme Court health care ruling, Hurricane Sandy, the fiscal cliff, and the Libya attack was nearly double that of younger adults. Those under 50 were most interested in the Connecticut and Colorado shootings, the presidential election, and to a lesser extent, gas prices.</p>
<p><strong>Big stories that got little attention</strong></p>
<p>There were, of course, plenty of significant stories in 2012 that received relatively little attention from American audiences. Less than 20 percent of the public followed the civil war in Syria at any point. The European debt crisis, which continues to have major implications for the U.S. economy, also attracted only minor interest. Perhaps more surprisingly, only a mere 8 percent of the public followed news about the Lance Armstrong doping scandal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And while science geeks might have popped the champagne after the discovery of Higgs boson, the subatomic particle thought to contain the basic building blocks of the universe, only about 12 percent of the public seemed to pay it to much mind.</p>

With the horrors of the Holocaust still fresh, world leaders wanted to protect people in the event they had to flee their own countries. The 1951 U.N. treaty specifically protects refugees with a credible fear of persecution or torture by their own governments based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or social group. In the United States, this means anyone with a credible fear can&rsquo;t be immediately deported. If they arrive seeking asylum and prove they have a credible fear during a border screening, their case must be decided in an immigration court. This put asylum seekers in a different category than those crossing the border in search of work or a better life. Undocumented economic migrants can be immediately deported without a hearing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Today, gang violence rather than government persecution is driving many people out of the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

This year, the Trump administration told immigration courts to deny asylum claims of people escaping gangs. Gangs, some lawmakers argue, aren&rsquo;t governments, so people escaping gang persecution can&rsquo;t qualify for asylum.

Which labor group helped fund and organize the first Earth Day celebration?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>2. Who made the following statement:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>&ldquo;Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions &hellip; It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they, more than we, will wreak the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.&rdquo;\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Rivers on fire\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Today, our planet needs all the love it can get. From the increasingly severe impacts of climate change to rapid deforestation and species extinction, there is broad scientific consensus that we&rsquo;re up against a mounting number of potentially catastrophic challenges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The evidence notwithstanding, many of America&rsquo;s strongest environmental protections are under attack in Washington, a battle that&rsquo;s grown more divisive and hyperpolitical than perhaps ever before. The Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders have demonstrated their determination to weaken or flat-out eliminate many long-standing regulations and regulatory agencies that they say kill jobs and impede economic growth.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For what it&rsquo;s worth, though, the environmental outlook in the late 1960s wasn&rsquo;t too rosy either.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After decades of largely unregulated industrial and economic growth in the wake of World War II, the U.S. had managed to majorly muck up its air and water resources. Toxic effluent from factories frequently spilled into streams and rivers. Open spaces were used as dumping grounds. DDT and other synthetic chemicals contaminated natural habitats and water supplies. And air pollution from factories and belching cars left many industrial areas shrouded in thick blankets of smog.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Here&rsquo;s a handful of the environmental catastrophes&nbsp;that happened within less than three years:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>November 1966\u003c/strong>: In New York City, 168 people die of respiratory-related illnesses over a three-day period due primarily to horrendously poor air quality.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>March 1967\u003c/strong>: Interior Department Secretary Stewart L. Udall announces the first official list of endangered wildlife species. Among the 78 species is the bald eagle, America&rsquo;s national bird.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>January 1969\u003c/strong>: A blowout at an offshore oil rig near Santa Barbara caused as much as \u003ca href=\"http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/45-years-after-santa-barbara-oil-spill-looking-historic-disaster-through-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">4.2 million gallons\u003c/a> of crude oil to spill into the Santa Barbara Channel and onto nearby beaches. It lasts for 10 straight days, becoming (at that point) the largest oil spill in American history. Today, it ranks only third, overtaken by the 1989 Exxon Valdez and 2010 Deepwater Horizon spills).\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>June 1969\u003c/strong>: A particularly fetid industrial stretch of the Cuyahoga River running through Cleveland bursts into flames (seriously) when oil-soaked debris in the water is ignited by sparks from a passing train.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>https://youtu.be/nlHiaZFvcXA\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>A movement begins\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>As&nbsp;urban unrest and the anti-war movement ignited across the nation, environmental activism had yet to gain a strong foothold.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If the people really understood that in the lifetime of their children, they&rsquo;re going to have destroyed the quality of the air and the water all over the world and perhaps made the globe unlivable in a half century, they&rsquo;d do something about it. But this is not well understood.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&rsquo;s a quote from Sen. Gaylord Nelson, a Democrat from Wisconsin, who spearheaded a national day of awareness in the aftermath of these environmental disasters, .\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If we could tap into the environmental concerns of the general public and infuse the student anti-war energy into the environmental cause, we could generate a demonstration that would force the issue onto the national political agenda.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In late 1969, Nelson formed a bipartisan congressional steering committee and enlisted Denis Hayes, a 25-year-old Harvard Law School dropout, to coordinate the initiative. Influenced by anti-war campus activism, Hayes sought to organize environmental teach-ins throughout the country to occur simultaneously on April 22, 1970.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[Interestingly, an independent Earth Day effort had earlier been proposed by peace activist John McConnell during a 1969 UNESCO conference in San Francisco. McConnell reserved the date of March 21, 1970 &mdash; the first day of spring &mdash; a month prior to Hayes&rsquo; event.]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With a limited budget and no email or internet access, Hayes and a small group of organizers mailed out thousands of appeals, recruiting an army of young volunteers to organize local events in communities and campuses across the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On Nov. 30, 1969, the New York Times reported:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Rising concern about the &lsquo;environmental crisis&rsquo; is sweeping the nation&rsquo;s campuses with an intensity that may be on its way to eclipsing student discontent over the war in Vietnam.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>The first Earth Day\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Interviewed in the recent PBS documentary \u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/earthdays/player/\" target=\"_blank\">Earth Days\u003c/a>, Hayes recalled the sentiment:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Lord knows what we thought we were doing. It was wild and exciting and out of control and the sort of thing that lets you know you&rsquo;ve really got something big happening &hellip; What we were trying to do was create a brand-new public consciousness that would cause the rules of the game to change.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the end, an estimated 20 million people&nbsp; participated in that first Earth Day, a name coined by advertising guru \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/04/22/401540530/julian-koenig-well-known-adman-named-earth-day\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Koenig\u003c/a> (father of Sarah Koenig of &ldquo;Serial&rdquo; podcast fame).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[\u003ca href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/topics/earthday.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read the NY Times article\u003c/a> from April 22, 1970]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>https://youtu.be/WbwC281uzUs?list=PL3480E41AA956A42B\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It was a huge high adrenaline effort that in the end genuinely changed things,&rdquo; Hayes said. &ldquo;Before (that), there were people that opposed freeways, people that opposed clear-cutting, or people worried about pesticides, (but) they didn&rsquo;t think of themselves as having anything in common. After Earth Day they were all part of an environmental movement.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hayes&rsquo; assertions were affirmed by several national polls showing a rapid rise in the public&rsquo;s concern about air and water resources. In the \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Xaw_LEGXnLgC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=gallup+poll+1970+air+and+water&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2VWCAqHwG0&amp;sig=cHedWfHfSGwQged_dPXyHtrbjSg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GEs1VfCRCJe3ogS7yoHIAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=gallup%20poll%201970%20air%20and%20water&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">Gallup Opinion Index\u003c/a>, the percentage of respondents who considered air and water pollution a top national problem rose from 17 percent in 1969 to 53 percent by 1970.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On Earth Day the following year, an independent group launched an anti-litter public service announcement, known as the &ldquo;Crying Indian,&rdquo; which featured a white actor in a headdress, rowing a birch bark canoe and shedding a tear when he sees garbage strewn everywhere. Despite the ad&rsquo;s culturally questionable premise, it proved&nbsp;enormously popular and is still considered one of the most successful public service announcements in history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>https://youtu.be/9Dmtkxm9yQY\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Unexpected&nbsp;allegiances\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>That brings us back to the first question of the quiz. The group most supportive of the first Earth Day organizing effort &mdash; financially and otherwise &mdash; was none other than the United Auto Workers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2012/05/UAW.jpg\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1888 alignright\" style=\"border: 0px none;\" title=\"UAW\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2012/05/UAW-300x387.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\">\u003c/a>A labor union not generally thought of for championing environmental causes, the UAW donated funds for the event and turned out volunteers across the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>UAW President Walter Reuther pledged his union&rsquo;s full support for Earth Day and for subsequent air quality legislation that the auto industry staunchly opposed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What good is a dollar an hour more in wages if your neighborhood is burning down?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What good is another week&rsquo;s vacation if the lake you used to go to is polluted and you can&rsquo;t swim in it and the kids can&rsquo;t play in it?&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sensing a political shift, General Motors president Edward Cole soon thereafter promised &ldquo;pollution-free&rdquo; cars by 1980. (That&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t pan out so well.)\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Nixon and the golden era of environmental regulation\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Remember the mystery quote?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That was said by President Richard Nixon during his 1970 State of the Union address.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yes, that Nixon, the conservative Republican most commonly remembered for prolonging America&rsquo;s involvement in Vietnam and resigning in disgrace over the Watergate scandal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Nixon also oversaw the most sweeping environmental regulations in the nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even before the first Earth Day, Congress passed the \u003ca href=\"http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/\">National Environmental Policy Act\u003c/a>,&nbsp;which among other things, required environmental impact statements for major new building projects and developments. Nixon signed it into law on&nbsp;Jan. 1, 1970.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Environmentalism had never been one of Nixon&rsquo;s major political priorities, but his administration &mdash; like the UAW &mdash; recognized the shifting political tide, as public outcry and media attention to environmental issues increased. It also didn&rsquo;t hurt that at the time both the House and Senate were controlled by Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within months, Nixon approved the creation of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.epa.gov/\">Environmental Protection Agency \u003c/a>(EPA) and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u003c/a>(NOAA). Later that year, he signed an extension of the Clean Air Act, requiring the newly formed EPA to create and enforce air regulations, which among other things led to the installation of catalytic converters on all cars sold in the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By the end of 1972, Nixon signed the Clean Water Act, Pesticide Control Act (which banned DDT) and Marine Mammal Protection Act. A year later, he also signed the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Water Drinking Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Most of these bills were approved with bipartisan support in Congress, in some instances nearly&nbsp;unanimously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a televised speech in 1972, Nixon said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We are taking these actions not in some distant future, but now, because we know that it is now or never.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Environmental conditions in the United States began to slowly improve. Which is not to say there wasn&rsquo;t strong political opposition and major lingering problems, But for a time &mdash; stretching through the Ford and Carter administrations &mdash; &nbsp;the pursuit of environmentalism maintained a strong bipartisan support. In the last year of his presidency, Carter even installed solar panels on the roof of the White House to promote renewable energy initiatives.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Green honeymoon ends\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The economic slowdown in the late 1970s swept in a tide of political change.&nbsp;In 1981, a year into his first term as president, Ronald Reagan appointed two aggressive defenders of industry to head the EPA and the Department of the Interior. &nbsp;As part of the &ldquo;Reagan Revolution,&rdquo; the administration moved rapidly to slash federal budgets, cutting the EPA&rsquo;s funding by nearly half. Environmental enforcement was weakened considerably, as large swaths of public land were opened up for&nbsp;mining, drilling, grazing and other private uses. In a famous symbolic act, the solar panels on the White House roof were dismantled during his second term.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To be fair, a number of significant environmental policies were advanced during Reagan&rsquo;s administration, including the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites, creation of wilderness areas and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.epa.gov/ozone/intpol/\" target=\"_blank\">Montreal Protocol\u003c/a>, an international agreement to&nbsp;protect the&nbsp;ozone layer&nbsp;by phasing out the production of substances responsible for&nbsp;its depletion, an effort that has been largely successful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the anti-regulatory sentiment established during Reagan&rsquo;s presidency took root. Efforts to strengthen the nation&rsquo;s environmental protection laws grew increasingly partisan, a trend that continues today. The stream of regulatory measures approved by Nixon four decades ago would have scant chance of passing today&rsquo;s Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Throughout his populist presidential campaign, President Trump repeatedly took aim at environmental regulations, promising to roll them back and attacking them as elitist, job-killing measures that showed just how out of touch politicians were with the true concerns of ordinary Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>The benefit of tangible problems\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Organizers of the first Earth Day had a key advantage: They were tackling visible, tangible problems impacting people&rsquo;s daily lives. Rivers and lakes were too polluted for kids to swim in; parks were strewn with trash; people were getting sick from foul air. The evidence was&nbsp;indisputable, and it made it a whole lot easier to draw clear connections between quality of life and the urgent need for strong environmental protections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In contrast, many of today&rsquo;s major environmental threats, like climate change &mdash; which threaten to be even more catastrophic &mdash; remain pretty abstract to many Americans. Unless you&rsquo;ve been a victim of some disaster directly related to climate change &mdash; say, your house has been destroyed because of sea-level rise &mdash; it&rsquo;s harder to connect the dots. And that makes it far more challenging to convey the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize the masses and pressure lawmakers to act. The abundance of scientific evidence showing that burning fossil fuels is the key driver of climate change, and the persistent warnings by scientists and activists of impending disaster if we continue along this course, have clearly not proven effective enough to push the kind of sweeping environmental policies enacted in the 1970s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The United States, one of the world&rsquo;s largest greenhouse gas emitters, refused to join the Kyoto Protocol, a 2005 international treaty approved by 180 nations requiring rapid cuts in emissions, and in 2010, Congress failed to pass comprehensive national climate change legislation. The U.S. did, however, sign on to \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html\" target=\"_blank\">landmark international climate accord in Paris in 2015\u003c/a>, in which it pledged to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions over the next decade. Environmental advocates and climate scientists generally agree that this marked a big step forward, but most say the deal doesn&rsquo;t go far enough to prevent the worst impacts of catastrophic climate change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For more on how we think about climate change, check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/climate-lab\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Lab\u003c/a>, a new video series from the University of California and Vox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, President Trump ran on a pledge to withdraw from the agreement entirely (although that now seems increasingly unlikely) and roll back the Obama administration&rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants\" target=\"_blank\">regulations\u003c/a> that set the course to reach the carbon reduction goal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of which begs an ominous question:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What degree of disaster is necessary to spur a new era of environmental change?\u003c/p>\n\n","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":2372,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":56},"modified":1524245146,"excerpt":"How the first Earth Day, 47 years ago, led to some of America's most sweeping environmental reforms.

Nixon signed it into law on&nbsp;Jan. 1, 1970.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Environmentalism had never been one of Nixon&rsquo;s major political priorities, but his administration &mdash; like the UAW &mdash; recognized the shifting political tide, as public outcry and media attention to environmental issues increased. It also didn&rsquo;t hurt that at the time both the House and Senate were controlled by Democrats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within months, Nixon approved the creation of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.epa.gov/\">Environmental Protection Agency \u003c/a>(EPA) and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u003c/a>(NOAA). Later that year, he signed an extension of the Clean Air Act, requiring the newly formed EPA to create and enforce air regulations, which among other things led to the installation of catalytic converters on all cars sold in the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By the end of 1972, Nixon signed the Clean Water Act, Pesticide Control Act (which banned DDT) and Marine Mammal Protection Act. A year later, he also signed the Endangered Species Act and the Safe Water Drinking Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Most of these bills were approved with bipartisan support in Congress, in some instances nearly&nbsp;unanimously.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a televised speech in 1972, Nixon said:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We are taking these actions not in some distant future, but now, because we know that it is now or never.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Environmental conditions in the United States began to slowly improve. Which is not to say there wasn&rsquo;t strong political opposition and major lingering problems, But for a time &mdash; stretching through the Ford and Carter administrations &mdash; &nbsp;the pursuit of environmentalism maintained a strong bipartisan support. In the last year of his presidency, Carter even installed solar panels on the roof of the White House to promote renewable energy initiatives.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Green honeymoon ends\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The economic slowdown in the late 1970s swept in a tide of political change.&nbsp;In 1981, a year into his first term as president, Ronald Reagan appointed two aggressive defenders of industry to head the EPA and the Department of the Interior. &nbsp;As part of the &ldquo;Reagan Revolution,&rdquo; the administration moved rapidly to slash federal budgets, cutting the EPA&rsquo;s funding by nearly half. Environmental enforcement was weakened considerably, as large swaths of public land were opened up for&nbsp;mining, drilling, grazing and other private uses. In a famous symbolic act, the solar panels on the White House roof were dismantled during his second term.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To be fair, a number of significant environmental policies were advanced during Reagan&rsquo;s administration, including the Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites, creation of wilderness areas and the \u003ca href=\"http://www.epa.gov/ozone/intpol/\" target=\"_blank\">Montreal Protocol\u003c/a>, an international agreement to&nbsp;protect the&nbsp;ozone layer&nbsp;by phasing out the production of substances responsible for&nbsp;its depletion, an effort that has been largely successful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the anti-regulatory sentiment established during Reagan&rsquo;s presidency took root. Efforts to strengthen the nation&rsquo;s environmental protection laws grew increasingly partisan, a trend that continues today. The stream of regulatory measures approved by Nixon four decades ago would have scant chance of passing today&rsquo;s Congress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Throughout his populist presidential campaign, President Trump repeatedly took aim at environmental regulations, promising to roll them back and attacking them as elitist, job-killing measures that showed just how out of touch politicians were with the true concerns of ordinary Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>\u003cstrong>The benefit of tangible problems\u003c/strong>\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Organizers of the first Earth Day had a key advantage: They were tackling visible, tangible problems impacting people&rsquo;s daily lives. Rivers and lakes were too polluted for kids to swim in; parks were strewn with trash; people were getting sick from foul air. The evidence was&nbsp;indisputable, and it made it a whole lot easier to draw clear connections between quality of life and the urgent need for strong environmental protections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In contrast, many of today&rsquo;s major environmental threats, like climate change &mdash; which threaten to be even more catastrophic &mdash; remain pretty abstract to many Americans. Unless you&rsquo;ve been a victim of some disaster directly related to climate change &mdash; say, your house has been destroyed because of sea-level rise &mdash; it&rsquo;s harder to connect the dots. And that makes it far more challenging to convey the sense of urgency necessary to mobilize the masses and pressure lawmakers to act. The abundance of scientific evidence showing that burning fossil fuels is the key driver of climate change, and the persistent warnings by scientists and activists of impending disaster if we continue along this course, have clearly not proven effective enough to push the kind of sweeping environmental policies enacted in the 1970s.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The United States, one of the world&rsquo;s largest greenhouse gas emitters, refused to join the Kyoto Protocol, a 2005 international treaty approved by 180 nations requiring rapid cuts in emissions, and in 2010, Congress failed to pass comprehensive national climate change legislation. The U.S. did, however, sign on to \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html\" target=\"_blank\">landmark international climate accord in Paris in 2015\u003c/a>, in which it pledged to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions over the next decade. Environmental advocates and climate scientists generally agree that this marked a big step forward, but most say the deal doesn&rsquo;t go far enough to prevent the worst impacts of catastrophic climate change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For more on how we think about climate change, check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/climate-lab\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Lab\u003c/a>, a new video series from the University of California and Vox.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, President Trump ran on a pledge to withdraw from the agreement entirely (although that now seems increasingly unlikely) and roll back the Obama administration&rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants\" target=\"_blank\">regulations\u003c/a> that set the course to reach the carbon reduction goal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All of which begs an ominous question:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What degree of disaster is necessary to spur a new era of environmental change?\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/lowdown/21839/when-rivers-caught-fire-a-brief-history-of-earth-day","authors":["1263"],"categories":["lowdown_245","lowdown_2399","lowdown_457","lowdown_572"],"tags":["lowdown_111","lowdown_2337","lowdown_2600"],"affiliates":["lowdown_2381"],"featImg":"lowdown_26637","label":"lowdown_2381"},"lowdown_30662":{"type":"posts","id":"lowdown_30662","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"lowdown","id":"30662","score":null,"sort":[1524095886000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"lowdown"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1524095886,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"A Look Inside the Youth Vaping Craze","title":"A Look Inside the Youth Vaping Craze","headTitle":"The Lowdown | KQED News","content":"\u003cp>https://youtu.be/P9zps5LsVXs\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It charges in your computer, it&rsquo;s small enough to fit snugly in your pocket, and it can even be used without anyone knowing about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is how teenagers smoke nowadays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Vaping -- inhaling and exhaling vapor produced by a battery-powered electronic cigarette, usually containing nicotine -- has become the most popular method of tobacco use among teens around the country. \u003ca href=\"https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/documents/2016_SGR_Fact_Sheet_508.pdf\">According to the Surgeon General\u003c/a>, nearly one in four middle and high school students have tried it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_30672\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"max-width: 800px\">\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-30672 size-medium\" src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-800x528.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"528\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-800x528.jpg 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-160x106.jpg 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-768x507.jpg 768w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-1020x674.jpg 1020w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-1200x792.jpg 1200w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-1180x779.jpg 1180w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-960x634.jpg 960w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-240x158.jpg 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-375x248.jpg 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand-520x343.jpg 520w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/Juul_in_hand.jpg 1599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\">\u003c/a>\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Juul e-cigarette \u003ccite>(\u003ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juul_in_hand.jpg\">Mylesclark96/Wikipedia\u003c/a>)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>One of the most popular vaping devices, made by Juul, a San Francisco-based company, looks a lot like a flash drive and has been referred to as the \"iphone of vaporizers.\" The Juul first launched in 2015 and has since become the \u003ca href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/juul-e-cigarette-one-million-units-sold-2017-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best selling e-cigarette\u003c/a> in the country.

It marked the first decline since 2011, when the the CDC began conducting the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Youth Tobacco Survey\u003c/a>, in which respondents are asked if they've used tobacco products within the last 30 days.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Between 2015 and 2016, underage use of e-cigarettes among high school students declined the most dramatically, falling to 11.3 percent of high schoolers in 2016, from 16 percent in 2015. But that drop comes after years of consecutive increases since 2011.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite these decreases, public health experts are concerned that the popularity of Juul and similar devices will send youth rates on the rise again.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I was smoking cigarettes as a coping mechanism, which is obviously incredibly awful, and I knew I had to stop, so I turned to Juuling,&rdquo; said a junior from Lowell High School in San Francisco who didn't want her name used.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trevor, a student at Lowell who doesn't vape, described the current fad:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;A ton of [people] have Juuls. I think it's a popularity thing. You&rsquo;re considered cooler if you have a Juul and hit it all the time.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that the Food and Drug Administration used its authority to regulate e-cigarettes and set the national minimum age to legally buy and consume them at 18. The rules, though, vary widely by state. In California, the minimum age is 21, but there's little stopping an 18-year-old student here from buying a vaping device online from a state like Texas, where the minimum age is much lower.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While vaping companies say they are opposed to underage use, many teens note how easy it is to purchase devices, either by going to smoke shops that don&rsquo;t check IDs or ordering them off of secondary sites like eBay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;When I got to vaping, I could physically do it anytime, anywhere and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter, and so you get used to just sipping on it,&rdquo; said a high school senior from San Jose who didn't want his name used. He admits he's definitely become somewhat addicted, but isn't too concerned about it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"I have confidence I could stop, it&rsquo;s not a long-time thing, but I&rsquo;m at a point where it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. I&rsquo;m young and I really enjoy it.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879.png\">\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-30684\" src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1647\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879.png 1000w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-160x264.png 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-800x1318.png 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-768x1265.png 768w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-729x1200.png 729w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-960x1581.png 960w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-240x395.png 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-375x618.png 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/26/2018/04/ucm569879-520x856.png 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\">\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/lowdown/30662/the-underage-vaping-explosion","authors":["11506","11507"],"categories":["lowdown_2618"],"tags":["lowdown_2337","lowdown_2655"],"featImg":"lowdown_30773","label":"lowdown"},"lowdown_26549":{"type":"posts","id":"lowdown_26549","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"lowdown","id":"26549","score":null,"sort":[1523588415000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"lowdown"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1523588415,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"It's Almost Tax Day.
