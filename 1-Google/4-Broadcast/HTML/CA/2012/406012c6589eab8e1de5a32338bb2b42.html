Will the term be extended? Will the year be lost? How will college admissions be affected? How will learning continue while kids are stuck indoors for weeks? Who will look after the kids? The rapid imposition of social distancing took many by surprise, and each school and individual teacher must contend with unique challenges as they grapple with the crisis.

Teachers who did not expect to teach online were caught understandably unprepared in the final leg of the school year. Some schools have the support systems in place that will make the transition easier, while many others have students who \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"http://theconversation.com/online-learning-will-be-hard-for-kids-whose-schools-close-and-the-digital-divide-will-make-it-even-harder-for-some-of-them-133338\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">do not have reliable internet access\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The web offers countless best practice guides and curated tool inventories, but educators currently in triage mode are not in a position to craft ideal online learning programs. This brief guide aims to help educators, administrators, and parents better navigate the pitfalls of making the quick jump to online learning. It curates useful tools and resources with a view to maintain the indispensable human touch of teaching and learning during this period of social distancing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The Foundation: A Flexible Mindset and Realistic Expectations\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">A positive attitude and a flexible mindset are key to make the online transition as smooth as possible. There is some liberation in accepting that the entire world is imperfectly adjusting to a new reality, and nobody expects business as usual.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Classes will not continue seamlessly, and lessons will have to be rejiggered to work within the constraints of time and technology. Formal tests and exams are difficult to administer online and will likely be postponed or cancelled. Science experiments, maker projects, and physical activities that require specialized equipment or spaces may no longer be possible. The school year will not unfold as planned, all curricular goals will not be met, and expectations should be managed accordingly. Rather, learning online may present an opportunity to apply creative solutions, learn some new tricks, connect with students in a new context, and support the community by keeping kids stimulated and productively occupied. Sounds an awful lot like business as usual.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leaders can best serve their schools and districts by prioritizing mental health over curricular efficiency. The anxiety produced by the evolving crisis is compounded with teachers who may now have their own children to care for at home, ill family members, the stress of managing household resources to comply with social distancing measures, or they may fall ill themselves. This is the context in which some teachers are asked to quickly redeploy their classes. Ideally, they will be granted sufficient time to organize their lives and reconfigure their classes before resuming teaching. It is also important for administrators to actively check-in with teachers to maintain personalized communication and take the pulse on how to best provide support.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Likewise, teachers should try to maintain personal connections with their students, which can be a challenge when mitigated by the Internet. But \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654311421793\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">strong student-teacher relationships positively affect school engagement and achievement\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and meaningful connections are particularly important for high schoolers, and vulnerable students in particular. Online learning can feel isolating and lacks the warmth of a busy classroom; however, teachers who transition from face-to-face classes have the advantage of having established relationships with their students. These can continue by facilitating informal interactions, such as sharing class-room appropriate memes, comics, images, or humorous short videos that may not be entirely relevant, but can help maintain the community and set an uplifting tone. Similarly, the class can use \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/5-online-discussion-tools-to-fuel-student-engagement\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">forums\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for formal discussion, but also to post pictures, stories and updates. Rather than whole-class meetings, organize periodic video meet-ups with smaller groups of students to chat, check-in and provide help, support and assistance. Finally, if school policy allows, individual calls and check-ins to support struggling students is crucial, as distance learning particularly \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/business/online-courses-are-harming-the-students-who-need-the-most-help.html\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">disadvantages students who struggle\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. On the flipside, online formats \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://blog.connectedcamps.com/online-communities-improve-social-skills-confidence-kids-autism/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">might be an advantage\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for some kids with autism.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most importantly, be kind and forgiving of yourself and your students. The next few months will be emotionally taxing, so pedagogical energies are better directed to the heart than the mind. Subject learning is important but, as the world is reshaped in the foreseeable future, there will be opportunities to learn invaluable lessons about community, family, civic responsibility, and social health: central components of human life that can be woven into the curriculum.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The Home/Work Routine: Workspace, Calendar, and Survey\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">First step: organize your space and time at home to accommodate your new work environment.

Disruption and discomfort are the enemies of complacency and can spur intense professional growth. Some teachers may be surprised to discover new tools, resources, and approaches to nourish their practice. They&rsquo;ll also get the chance to see their students in a new light, and maybe better connect with their own families. In the case of younger students, there will be a need to more deeply involve parents in the learning process. Schools may want to explicitly communicate that any parents in a position to support their children&rsquo;s learning should do so with some helpful guidelines to proceed.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another positive is that remote learning can be carried out asynchronously, meaning that both teachers and students can work and contribute when it&rsquo;s convenient for them if they don&rsquo;t have to be in a specific place at a specific time. This flexibility can allow educators to manage life at home while doing school, and it might even allow kids to get that sleep that seems to be in short supply.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"55521 https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=55521","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2020/03/16/resources-for-teaching-and-learning-during-this-period-of-social-distancing/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":2005,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":24},"modified":1585068241,"excerpt":"School closures related to COVID-19 have forced classroom teachers into scrambling to become online educators.

Will the term be extended? Will the year be lost? How will college admissions be affected? How will learning continue while kids are stuck indoors for weeks? Who will look after the kids? The rapid imposition of social distancing took many by surprise, and each school and individual teacher must contend with unique challenges as they grapple with the crisis. Some districts have sent kids home with a provisional two weeks worth of \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://chalkbeat.org/posts/newark/2020/03/12/newark-prepares-take-home-assignments-for-students-in-case-of-coronavirus-closures/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">homework\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, while others have followed universities like \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://edsource.org/2020/colleges-in-california-and-across-the-country-move-to-online-instruction-in-response-to-coronavirus/625099\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stanford and Berkeley\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and pivoted to remote learning in a bid to salvage the year. While the move online is the best approach to continue classes, it not only entails a change in format, but also demands a change in practice.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Designing effective distance learning programs requires planning and targeted professional development. Teachers who did not expect to teach online were caught understandably unprepared in the final leg of the school year. Some schools have the support systems in place that will make the transition easier, while many others have students who \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"http://theconversation.com/online-learning-will-be-hard-for-kids-whose-schools-close-and-the-digital-divide-will-make-it-even-harder-for-some-of-them-133338\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">do not have reliable internet access\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The web offers countless best practice guides and curated tool inventories, but educators currently in triage mode are not in a position to craft ideal online learning programs. This brief guide aims to help educators, administrators, and parents better navigate the pitfalls of making the quick jump to online learning. It curates useful tools and resources with a view to maintain the indispensable human touch of teaching and learning during this period of social distancing.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The Foundation: A Flexible Mindset and Realistic Expectations\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">A positive attitude and a flexible mindset are key to make the online transition as smooth as possible. There is some liberation in accepting that the entire world is imperfectly adjusting to a new reality, and nobody expects business as usual.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Classes will not continue seamlessly, and lessons will have to be rejiggered to work within the constraints of time and technology. Formal tests and exams are difficult to administer online and will likely be postponed or cancelled. Science experiments, maker projects, and physical activities that require specialized equipment or spaces may no longer be possible. The school year will not unfold as planned, all curricular goals will not be met, and expectations should be managed accordingly. Rather, learning online may present an opportunity to apply creative solutions, learn some new tricks, connect with students in a new context, and support the community by keeping kids stimulated and productively occupied. Sounds an awful lot like business as usual.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leaders can best serve their schools and districts by prioritizing mental health over curricular efficiency. The anxiety produced by the evolving crisis is compounded with teachers who may now have their own children to care for at home, ill family members, the stress of managing household resources to comply with social distancing measures, or they may fall ill themselves. This is the context in which some teachers are asked to quickly redeploy their classes. Ideally, they will be granted sufficient time to organize their lives and reconfigure their classes before resuming teaching. It is also important for administrators to actively check-in with teachers to maintain personalized communication and take the pulse on how to best provide support.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Likewise, teachers should try to maintain personal connections with their students, which can be a challenge when mitigated by the Internet. But \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654311421793\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">strong student-teacher relationships positively affect school engagement and achievement\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and meaningful connections are particularly important for high schoolers, and vulnerable students in particular. Online learning can feel isolating and lacks the warmth of a busy classroom; however, teachers who transition from face-to-face classes have the advantage of having established relationships with their students. These can continue by facilitating informal interactions, such as sharing class-room appropriate memes, comics, images, or humorous short videos that may not be entirely relevant, but can help maintain the community and set an uplifting tone. Similarly, the class can use \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/5-online-discussion-tools-to-fuel-student-engagement\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">forums\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for formal discussion, but also to post pictures, stories and updates. Rather than whole-class meetings, organize periodic video meet-ups with smaller groups of students to chat, check-in and provide help, support and assistance. Finally, if school policy allows, individual calls and check-ins to support struggling students is crucial, as distance learning particularly \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/business/online-courses-are-harming-the-students-who-need-the-most-help.html\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">disadvantages students who struggle\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">. On the flipside, online formats \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://blog.connectedcamps.com/online-communities-improve-social-skills-confidence-kids-autism/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">might be an advantage\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for some kids with autism.&nbsp;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most importantly, be kind and forgiving of yourself and your students. The next few months will be emotionally taxing, so pedagogical energies are better directed to the heart than the mind. Subject learning is important but, as the world is reshaped in the foreseeable future, there will be opportunities to learn invaluable lessons about community, family, civic responsibility, and social health: central components of human life that can be woven into the curriculum.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cb>The Home/Work Routine: Workspace, Calendar, and Survey\u003c/b>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">First step: organize your space and time at home to accommodate your new work environment.

Disruption and discomfort are the enemies of complacency and can spur intense professional growth. Some teachers may be surprised to discover new tools, resources, and approaches to nourish their practice. They&rsquo;ll also get the chance to see their students in a new light, and maybe better connect with their own families. In the case of younger students, there will be a need to more deeply involve parents in the learning process. Schools may want to explicitly communicate that any parents in a position to support their children&rsquo;s learning should do so with some helpful guidelines to proceed.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another positive is that remote learning can be carried out asynchronously, meaning that both teachers and students can work and contribute when it&rsquo;s convenient for them if they don&rsquo;t have to be in a specific place at a specific time. This flexibility can allow educators to manage life at home while doing school, and it might even allow kids to get that sleep that seems to be in short supply.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/55521/resources-for-teaching-and-learning-during-this-period-of-social-distancing","authors":["11107"],"categories":["mindshift_192"],"tags":["mindshift_21344","mindshift_21343","mindshift_358","mindshift_20784","mindshift_1040","mindshift_187","mindshift_122"],"featImg":"mindshift_55527","label":"mindshift"},"mindshift_43601":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_43601","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"43601","score":null,"sort":[1454487320000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"mindshift"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1454487320,"format":"standard","disqusTitle":"What’s Lost When Kids Are 'Under-connected’ to the Internet?","title":"What’s Lost When Kids Are 'Under-connected’ to the Internet?","headTitle":"MindShift | KQED News","content":"\u003cp>Ownership of mobile devices has grown swiftly since the introduction of the smartphone and has created more opportunities to connect to the Internet.

Participants print out yellow arrow stickers from the website , each with a unique identifying code, and place them in public places that have important local meaning. People who know about the project can text the Yellow Arrow phone number with the unique code and instantly receive the story or piece of local lore the author marked.

The game also offers opportunities to research contemporary issues connected to the university and contribute stories using the platform.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://arisgames.org/featured/mentira/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>MENTIRA\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: This game was started in Albuquerque to teach Spanish. Players interact with virtual characters as well as real residents of one of the city&rsquo;s Spanish-speaking neighborhoods to investigate a fictional murder. Following clues given by game characters and real people, students must \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2012/04/augmented-reality-coming-soon-to-a-school-near-you/\" target=\"_blank\">play out the narrative and engage with people using their Spanish\u003c/a> at the same time. &ldquo;One of the goals of this story is to get people out into a neighborhood, and the way you are doing it is through an invented story that uses Spanish,&rdquo; Matthews said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://arisgames.org/jewish-time-jump/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>JEWISH TIME JUMP\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Using GPS technology on students&rsquo; mobile devices, archival images and tidbits of information pop up as students move around a park that sits across the street from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/triangle-shirtwaist-fire\" target=\"_blank\">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory\u003c/a>, site of the famous fire that drew attention to the dangerous conditions in sweatshops. Players interrogate virtual historical figures like Rose Schneiderman, read primary source documents and slowly piece together the history of Jewish immigration in New York, the labor movement and women&rsquo;s rights.

Teams compete to come up with visible, public actions that engage the public around different historical moments. Players are given cards associated with different sites and document their actions along the way. It requires creativity, research and knowledge to win the challenge. Players have to walk a fine line between being authentic to history and being playful -- one of the many interesting aspects of participatory gaming.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://mobile.wisc.edu/news/project-sustainable-u/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>SUSTAINABLE U\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Players find themselves in a dystopian future where natural resources are running out and something must be done to change the course of history. Players receive quests to explore transportation, water and waste policies at a university. After researching what&rsquo;s already been tried, they come up with new ways to address sustainability. &ldquo;One of the challenges is to go out and find where energy is being wasted and change your own behavior,&rdquo; Matthews said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/projects/upriver/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>UP RIVER\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Designed to make learning about the St. Louis Estuary more participatory, this virtual game leads students through the estuary to various places, some more industrial, others that look like the natural habitat that once existed. Students investigate important scientific factors like oxygen levels in the water, vital for fish stocks, and interact with virtual historical characters who can describe what the area was once like. The game includes questions and challenges that require students to interact with contemporary people, like fishermen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;re experimenting with is how can you integrate stories with field work,&rdquo; Matthews said. Students are collecting water samples, but learning about the local lore of the place as well. This kind of game reinforces the notion that real problems aren&rsquo;t siloed by discipline. Cleaning up an estuary has real effects on local businesses of all kinds, for good and bad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://communityplanit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>COMMUNITY PLANIT\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: This game allows students to get involved in city planning at the local level. Students complete missions in the real world to win virtual coins. They can spend those coins to vote for how funds will be allocated for real city projects. &ldquo;One of the neat things about this is that folks are tying it into planning projects that are already taking place,&rdquo; Matthews said.

Capturing it creates a record of its existence, and players can curate their own list of favorite artwork.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://citydigits.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>LOCAL LOTO\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Focusing on the lottery and its effects on communities, the game asks students to look at the quantitative data about the lottery and then go out into the community and gather stories of people who play and why. After they&rsquo;ve conducted all their research, students form their own position about whether they think the lottery is good or bad for the neighborhood as a whole.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These are just a few examples of the kinds of activities&nbsp;local game labs, teachers and nonprofits have developed to connect mobile gaming to real places and the communities that bring them to life. &ldquo;The games challenge learning to be relevant, using classroom skills and fascinating stories from life,&rdquo; Stokes said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He thinks real-world&nbsp;gaming has the power to re-engage young people with civics and ignite their passion to have an impact. &ldquo;Engage them in studying places where they already hang out and use technology that they already use,&rdquo; Stokes said. Doing so not only helps teach them, but it could also empower them too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I think we can actually try to be a little more ambitious beyond learning,&rdquo; Stokes said. &ldquo;Look at the contribution your young people might be able to make to their community.&rdquo; As citizen scientists, community ethnographers and storytellers, chroniclers of injustice or city disfunction -- students can make a difference in their communities and often find great satisfaction in learning that allows them to do so.\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"37450 http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=37450","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/09/17/how-virtual-reality-meets-real-life-learning-with-mobile-games/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":1888,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":29},"modified":1410971572,"excerpt":"Games played on mobile devices allow teachers to leverage all the information on the internet along with the lived experiences of people in real life.","headData":{"twImgId":"","twTitle":"","ogTitle":"","ogImgId":"","twDescription":"","description":"Games played on mobile devices allow teachers to leverage all the information on the internet along with the lived experiences of people in real life.","title":"How Virtual Reality Meets Real Life Learning With Mobile Games | KQED","ogDescription":"","schema":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"How Virtual Reality Meets Real Life Learning With Mobile Games","datePublished":"2014-09-17T07:00:26-07:00","dateModified":"2014-09-17T09:32:52-07:00","image":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KQED-OG-Image@1x.png"}},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"how-virtual-reality-meets-real-life-learning-with-mobile-games","status":"publish","path":"/mindshift/37450/how-virtual-reality-meets-real-life-learning-with-mobile-games","audioTrackLength":null,"parsedContent":[{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_37453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/7095143045/in/photolist-iH98pX-5ngcJT-6eS6Wh-QaTah-bCSMuE-6Biz2M-3jFR8B-8NM84a-93c4vw-4VMShe-9pmJEi-8NMgQT-6eS6VQ-cZCJSu-bNYsQv-8bvNhp-7zgjmd-bvnyRK-5sgavg-5HVcnD-5z8FH3-oxYadi\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-37453\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/08/dow-day-pic.jpg\" alt=\"Participatory games let students see archival footage of events that happened in the places where they stand.(Rosenfeld Media/Flickr)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/08/dow-day-pic.jpg 640w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/08/dow-day-pic-400x225.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/08/dow-day-pic-320x180.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\u003c/a>\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Participatory games let students see archival footage of events that happened in the places where they stand.

Players have to walk a fine line between being authentic to history and being playful -- one of the many interesting aspects of participatory gaming.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://mobile.wisc.edu/news/project-sustainable-u/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>SUSTAINABLE U\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Players find themselves in a dystopian future where natural resources are running out and something must be done to change the course of history. Players receive quests to explore transportation, water and waste policies at a university. After researching what&rsquo;s already been tried, they come up with new ways to address sustainability. &ldquo;One of the challenges is to go out and find where energy is being wasted and change your own behavior,&rdquo; Matthews said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://engagementgamelab.org/projects/upriver/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>UP RIVER\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Designed to make learning about the St. Louis Estuary more participatory, this virtual game leads students through the estuary to various places, some more industrial, others that look like the natural habitat that once existed. Students investigate important scientific factors like oxygen levels in the water, vital for fish stocks, and interact with virtual historical characters who can describe what the area was once like. The game includes questions and challenges that require students to interact with contemporary people, like fishermen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;re experimenting with is how can you integrate stories with field work,&rdquo; Matthews said. Students are collecting water samples, but learning about the local lore of the place as well. This kind of game reinforces the notion that real problems aren&rsquo;t siloed by discipline. Cleaning up an estuary has real effects on local businesses of all kinds, for good and bad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://communityplanit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>COMMUNITY PLANIT\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: This game allows students to get involved in city planning at the local level. Students complete missions in the real world to win virtual coins. They can spend those coins to vote for how funds will be allocated for real city projects. &ldquo;One of the neat things about this is that folks are tying it into planning projects that are already taking place,&rdquo; Matthews said.

Capturing it creates a record of its existence, and players can curate their own list of favorite artwork.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://citydigits.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cstrong>LOCAL LOTO\u003c/strong>\u003c/a>: Focusing on the lottery and its effects on communities, the game asks students to look at the quantitative data about the lottery and then go out into the community and gather stories of people who play and why. After they&rsquo;ve conducted all their research, students form their own position about whether they think the lottery is good or bad for the neighborhood as a whole.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These are just a few examples of the kinds of activities&nbsp;local game labs, teachers and nonprofits have developed to connect mobile gaming to real places and the communities that bring them to life. &ldquo;The games challenge learning to be relevant, using classroom skills and fascinating stories from life,&rdquo; Stokes said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He thinks real-world&nbsp;gaming has the power to re-engage young people with civics and ignite their passion to have an impact. &ldquo;Engage them in studying places where they already hang out and use technology that they already use,&rdquo; Stokes said.

Many of his graduate students present technology projects that they define as a redefinition of learning -- the highest level in the SAMR model -- but November sees them as merely substitution. For example, one of his students presented on \u003ca href=\"http://leafsnap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leafsnap\u003c/a>, an electronic field guide app that allows students to take a photo of a plant leaf and quickly learn about its biological traits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What did they just learn?&rdquo; November asked a crowd of educators at ISTE 2014 in Atlanta. &ldquo;How to take a picture. That's what they learned.&rdquo; While the Leafsnap app is cool, it doesn&rsquo;t meet November's criteria for using technology. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s really important to start with a framework of: Does technology add any value?&rdquo; he said. He uses six questions to determine value, arguing that if the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any of the questions, the use of technology should be considered suspect.\u003c/p>\n\u003col>\n\u003cli>Did the assignment create capacity for critical thinking on the Web?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Did the assignment reach new areas of teaching students to develop new lines of inquiry?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Are there opportunities to broaden the perspective of the conversation with authentic audiences from around the world?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Is there an opportunity for students to publish (across various media) with an opportunity for continuous feedback?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Is there an option for students to create a contribution (purposeful work)?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Were students introduced to the best example in the world of the content or skill?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ol>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I think these six elements separate what&rsquo;s transformational from what I would call the $1,000 pencil,&rdquo; November said. Instead of using Leafsnap, November would like to see teachers challenge students to think critically with a question like, \"Which plants will die first when the effects of climate change begin to be felt?\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That question couldn't have been answered by students before the Internet age, but now a question like that forces students to use the Internet to investigate a globally relevant topic and gives them the opportunity to add value to the conversation about climate change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT TECH USE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dissatisfaction with the frameworks currently available to evaluate whether technology is transforming learning prompted Graber and her colleagues, including \u003ca href=\"http://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott McLeod\u003c/a>, to try and develop a \u003ca href=\"http://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/2014/08/toward-better-technology-integration-introducing-trudacot.html\" target=\"_blank\">new set of questions\u003c/a> to help move past obvious qualities like student engagement to a deeper investigation of the pedagogy behind the activity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Three of the most important traits they look at when evaluating a lesson are whether it is discipline specific, promotes critical thinking and whether technology is used in transformative ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Discipline specific:\u003c/em> Are students learning discipline-specific and appropriate content and knowledge? If so, is student work focused around big important concepts in that discipline? Are students using discipline-specific practices, tools and technologies as part of the activity?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t tell which discipline the lesson fits into, that&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; Graber said. The educators at ISTE returned to the Mystery Skype video example to practice Graber&rsquo;s suggested evaluation tools. They evaluated only what they could see in the video, treating it like a single classroom visit, when a coach or administrator gets only a tiny snapshot of a classroom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To many teachers in the room, it wasn't clear what discipline the activity focused on -- while geography might be one guess, the skills discussed were not specific to that discipline, nor were the tools and processes focused on geography.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Critical thinking/Creativity/Initiative/Metacognition:\u003c/em> Does the activity go beyond facts or previously provided ways of thinking? Do the students have the opportunity to design, create or in other ways add unique value? Do students have the opportunity to take initiative to go beyond the parameters of the given assignment? Do students have the opportunity to reflect on their planning, thinking, work and progress?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>In the Mystery Skype example, many of these qualities don&rsquo;t seem to exist. The video states students each had a task, but some tasks required more critical thinking or reflection than others. A few kids were getting good practice designing smart questions, but they weren&rsquo;t going beyond the parameters of the project, creating anything unique, or reflecting on their work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Use of technology:\u003c/em> Is the technology a means, not the end? Does the technology add value so that students can do their work in better or different ways from what was possible before technology? Are digital technologies used meaningfully for learning tasks?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>The group of ISTE educators came up with mixed answers on this item when evaluating the Mystery Skype activity. The activity wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without technology, but learning goals like effective questioning, collaboration and reflection on the process might have been better achieved for every student in the room without it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This sample analysis is&nbsp;merely an&nbsp;example of how this evaluation framework could be used. The ultimate goal is to move from talking about liking or disliking an activity to a deeper evaluation of the lesson, providing useful and actionable feedback to the teacher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Graber is clear that instructional coaches and administrators should not use this process if they aren&rsquo;t committed to observation and evaluation as a means for improvement. These conversations can happen within the context of a teacher&rsquo;s personal goals for the year or within the frame of schoolwide goals, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be used for evaluation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If we aren't seeing what we want to be seeing, what is the system provided to change that?&rdquo; Graber asked. &ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t anything, then don&rsquo;t use this.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to go into a classroom and point out problems with a teacher&rsquo;s lesson if the district or school doesn't have a plan for providing support to the teacher as she works to change and deepen her practice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Design professional development so it&rsquo;s all about growth and descriptive feedback, not about evaluation,&rdquo; Graber said. She suggests coaches find really good positive examples of lessons that elicit strong affirmatives to the questions above. Teachers need to see what it looks like before they can begin to model it themselves. Graber does not recommend dissecting a lesson like Mystery Skype with a group of teachers if one of them is featured in the video. It&rsquo;s much better to practice with anonymous educators to begin having the conversations. Graber and McLeod have found this framework especially useful as professional development before a lesson. It can help start powerful conversations about technology use and could&nbsp;begin to move practice, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The goal of this framework is to push past the typical response to digital activities in the classroom that focus on student engagement and instead evaluate whether students are truly using higher-order thinking skills, learning core aspects of a specific discipline and using technology in the most powerful and transformative ways.\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"37330 http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=37330","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/09/10/taking-classroom-tech-use-to-the-next-level-specific-traits-to-look-for/","stats":{"hasVideo":true,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":1706,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":26},"modified":1410307125,"excerpt":"Dissatisfied with existing frameworks used to judge the effectiveness of classroom tech a group of instructional coaches are trying to build their own tool with help from other educators.","headData":{"twImgId":"","twTitle":"","ogTitle":"","ogImgId":"","twDescription":"","description":"Dissatisfied with existing frameworks used to judge the effectiveness of classroom tech a group of instructional coaches are trying to build their own tool with help from other educators.","title":"Taking Classroom Tech Use to the Next Level: Specific Traits to Look For | KQED","ogDescription":"","schema":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"Taking Classroom Tech Use to the Next Level: Specific Traits to Look For","datePublished":"2014-09-10T07:00:26-07:00","dateModified":"2014-09-09T16:58:45-07:00","image":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KQED-OG-Image@1x.png"}},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"taking-classroom-tech-use-to-the-next-level-specific-traits-to-look-for","status":"publish","path":"/mindshift/37330/taking-classroom-tech-use-to-the-next-level-specific-traits-to-look-for","audioTrackLength":null,"parsedContent":[{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_37704\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/09/animation.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-37704\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/09/animation.jpg\" alt=\"Kids create stop motion videos in class.

He uses six questions to determine value, arguing that if the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any of the questions, the use of technology should be considered suspect.\u003c/p>\n\u003col>\n\u003cli>Did the assignment create capacity for critical thinking on the Web?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Did the assignment reach new areas of teaching students to develop new lines of inquiry?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Are there opportunities to broaden the perspective of the conversation with authentic audiences from around the world?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Is there an opportunity for students to publish (across various media) with an opportunity for continuous feedback?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Is there an option for students to create a contribution (purposeful work)?\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Were students introduced to the best example in the world of the content or skill?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ol>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I think these six elements separate what&rsquo;s transformational from what I would call the $1,000 pencil,&rdquo; November said. Instead of using Leafsnap, November would like to see teachers challenge students to think critically with a question like, \"Which plants will die first when the effects of climate change begin to be felt?\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That question couldn't have been answered by students before the Internet age, but now a question like that forces students to use the Internet to investigate a globally relevant topic and gives them the opportunity to add value to the conversation about climate change.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT TECH USE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dissatisfaction with the frameworks currently available to evaluate whether technology is transforming learning prompted Graber and her colleagues, including \u003ca href=\"http://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott McLeod\u003c/a>, to try and develop a \u003ca href=\"http://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/2014/08/toward-better-technology-integration-introducing-trudacot.html\" target=\"_blank\">new set of questions\u003c/a> to help move past obvious qualities like student engagement to a deeper investigation of the pedagogy behind the activity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Three of the most important traits they look at when evaluating a lesson are whether it is discipline specific, promotes critical thinking and whether technology is used in transformative ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Discipline specific:\u003c/em> Are students learning discipline-specific and appropriate content and knowledge? If so, is student work focused around big important concepts in that discipline? Are students using discipline-specific practices, tools and technologies as part of the activity?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t tell which discipline the lesson fits into, that&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; Graber said. The educators at ISTE returned to the Mystery Skype video example to practice Graber&rsquo;s suggested evaluation tools. They evaluated only what they could see in the video, treating it like a single classroom visit, when a coach or administrator gets only a tiny snapshot of a classroom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To many teachers in the room, it wasn't clear what discipline the activity focused on -- while geography might be one guess, the skills discussed were not specific to that discipline, nor were the tools and processes focused on geography.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Critical thinking/Creativity/Initiative/Metacognition:\u003c/em> Does the activity go beyond facts or previously provided ways of thinking? Do the students have the opportunity to design, create or in other ways add unique value? Do students have the opportunity to take initiative to go beyond the parameters of the given assignment? Do students have the opportunity to reflect on their planning, thinking, work and progress?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>In the Mystery Skype example, many of these qualities don&rsquo;t seem to exist. The video states students each had a task, but some tasks required more critical thinking or reflection than others. A few kids were getting good practice designing smart questions, but they weren&rsquo;t going beyond the parameters of the project, creating anything unique, or reflecting on their work.\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cem>Use of technology:\u003c/em> Is the technology a means, not the end? Does the technology add value so that students can do their work in better or different ways from what was possible before technology? Are digital technologies used meaningfully for learning tasks?\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>The group of ISTE educators came up with mixed answers on this item when evaluating the Mystery Skype activity. The activity wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without technology, but learning goals like effective questioning, collaboration and reflection on the process might have been better achieved for every student in the room without it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This sample analysis is&nbsp;merely an&nbsp;example of how this evaluation framework could be used. The ultimate goal is to move from talking about liking or disliking an activity to a deeper evaluation of the lesson, providing useful and actionable feedback to the teacher.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Graber is clear that instructional coaches and administrators should not use this process if they aren&rsquo;t committed to observation and evaluation as a means for improvement. These conversations can happen within the context of a teacher&rsquo;s personal goals for the year or within the frame of schoolwide goals, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be used for evaluation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If we aren't seeing what we want to be seeing, what is the system provided to change that?&rdquo; Graber asked. &ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t anything, then don&rsquo;t use this.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to go into a classroom and point out problems with a teacher&rsquo;s lesson if the district or school doesn't have a plan for providing support to the teacher as she works to change and deepen her practice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Design professional development so it&rsquo;s all about growth and descriptive feedback, not about evaluation,&rdquo; Graber said. She suggests coaches find really good positive examples of lessons that elicit strong affirmatives to the questions above. Teachers need to see what it looks like before they can begin to model it themselves. Graber does not recommend dissecting a lesson like Mystery Skype with a group of teachers if one of them is featured in the video. It&rsquo;s much better to practice with anonymous educators to begin having the conversations. Graber and McLeod have found this framework especially useful as professional development before a lesson. It can help start powerful conversations about technology use and could&nbsp;begin to move practice, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The goal of this framework is to push past the typical response to digital activities in the classroom that focus on student engagement and instead evaluate whether students are truly using higher-order thinking skills, learning core aspects of a specific discipline and using technology in the most powerful and transformative ways.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/37330/taking-classroom-tech-use-to-the-next-level-specific-traits-to-look-for","authors":["234"],"categories":["mindshift_193"],"tags":["mindshift_1040","mindshift_187","mindshift_237","mindshift_963"],"featImg":"mindshift_37704","label":"mindshift"},"mindshift_35726":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_35726","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"35726","score":null,"sort":[1405432820000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"mindshift"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1405432820,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"5 Essential Insights About Mobile Learning","title":"5 Essential Insights About Mobile Learning","headTitle":"MindShift | KQED News","content":"\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_36709\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-36709\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061.jpg\" alt=\"Erin Scott/MindShift\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061.jpg 640w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061-400x225.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061-320x180.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erin Scott/MindShift\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp class=\"dropcap-serif\">Just a few years ago, mobile devices were almost unheard of in classrooms.

Develop a strong community of support for the initiative early and keep up transparent communication with parents and community members throughout the process.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Long before we handed out the first device, we started a community awareness program in terms of what we were planning to do and why,&rdquo; Smith said. District representatives held many community meetings where they explained why it would be important for students to come out of school fluent in technology use and with a collaborative set of skills different from what parents were expected to have. By describing a vision for what students would be able to do after leaving school, Smith gradually won over parents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Things were a lot different then,&rdquo; said \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/01/how-byod-programs-can-fuel-inquiry-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Clark\u003c/a>, Coordinator of Instructional Technology for \u003ca href=\"http://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/site/default.aspx?PageID=1\" target=\"_blank\">Forsyth County Schools in Georgia\u003c/a>. The iPad hadn&rsquo;t even been released yet when Forsyth began its program. &ldquo;Now the parents are expecting it and are actually driving our schools to adopt even more mobile learning because they want students to find instructional purposes for those devices in their pockets.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The strong vision for how mobile learning can change teaching and learning was the core of the communication between district officials and the community. Getting everyone on board with the ultimate goal helped them deal with the inevitable bumps in rolling out the technology and learning to use it for learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>3. Think about equity, but don&rsquo;t let it stop forward motion.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While some districts deal with more poverty than others, equity concerns are part of every school administrator&rsquo;s job. Many districts that pioneered mobile learning programs did so because they wanted to offer more equal access to the benefits of anytime-anywhere access to knowledge that computers offer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"When you give every student a device, it levels that playing field, but there are still inequities,&rdquo; Smith said. His district charges each student a $50 tech fee per year. A local education foundation has agreed to pay for families who can&rsquo;t afford the fee, but about half of the families eligible for free and reduced price lunch still pay the fee because they recognize its importance for their children, Smith said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For many districts embracing a 24-7 mobile learning program, the toughest equity challenge is getting every student access to the internet at home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying to build lots of partnerships,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. Her district \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/think-big-how-to-jumpstart-tech-use-in-low-income-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">includes both urban and rural areas\u003c/a>, each of which have access issues. The district has been mapping resources that already exist, convincing cities to extend their programs if they are offering free internet in downtown business districts, and making sure students and parents know how to save resources for offline use.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Most of our kids are bringing a device to school, so we&rsquo;ve just been able to supplement what students bring in with school owned technology,&rdquo; Clark said. His students go back and forth between school-owned devices and their own, depending on need and in case of battery failure or other technical difficulties. It&rsquo;s become a very fluid process, he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>4. Evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile learning initiative based on the goals set at the beginning of the rollout.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s easy to use improved test scores as a measure of whether a mobile learning initiative has been successful, but school leaders recommend trying to evaluate the goals set forth in the original vision and to think about evaluation holistically. If one element of a district&rsquo;s vision is to put more power to direct learning in the hands of students, test scores aren&rsquo;t the most appropriate measure of that goal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[contextly_sidebar id=\"bbc86d0e49f0b2ed278b2c409f765c1d\"]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Everybody wants to look at test scores because that&rsquo;s a measurable goal that everyone understands, but there are other things that you can use to evaluate success,&rdquo; Smith said. His district is in the sixth year of implementation and has found that graduation rates, attendance rates and academic success are all up. Meanwhile discipline issues and dropout rates are down. &ldquo;Is that all because of technology? Absolutely not, but it is certainly a contributing factor for being able to meet all students where they are,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s also tempting to expect results immediately, but leaders recommended allowing three to four years for educators and parents to grow into the program before expecting to see its value.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>5. Some of the biggest lessons learned include giving up control and trusting students.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;A lot of our shifts are making sure we are not mandating any more than we have to and that we&rsquo;re empowering as much as we can,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. She found that once devices were in the hands of teachers and students there was far more potential for creativity and student empowerment than district officials had imagined. The district has been working to get out of the way of that generative energy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;One of the things I would do early is bring the students into the process because I think their insights are pretty powerful and sometimes surprising in the way they think about things,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. If she could re-do her rollout she would have \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/06/students-speak-up-trust-us-with-devices/\" target=\"_blank\">included students in the discussions\u003c/a> long before devices were chosen or in classrooms. They are stakeholders in their own education, but often aren&rsquo;t included in the decisions that will directly affect their daily instruction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Over time you start to really focus in on what students are doing and learning with those devices and then where is the rigor of instruction and where is the authenticity of instructional tasks,&rdquo; Clark said. He noted that it's natural for schools to worry about the technical aspects of a rollout, but the novelty of the devices wears off quickly and when it does the whole school community can become even more focused on how to use the devices to offer the best learning opportunities possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>STAY NIMBLE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While these mobile learning pioneers have seen some of the pitfalls and can help districts new to the game avoid the same stumbles, this space is changing quickly and every community&rsquo;s needs will be different.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer just something you implement; it&rsquo;s evolving and it&rsquo;s unique in each location,&rdquo; Bjerede said. &ldquo;If you try to be cookie cutter about it you won&rsquo;t meet the needs of every kid in every classroom.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The technology will change, students will surprise their teachers and the best advice to district leaders is to stay open to all the possibilities and allow students to take control of the tremendous learning opportunity that having a device at all times could offer them.\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"35726 http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=35726","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/07/15/5-essential-insights-about-mobile-learning/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":1676,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":32},"modified":1405434642,"excerpt":"As mobile learning becomes more common, district leaders are working hard to juggle nimble adaptation in a changing environment and the desire to get it right.","headData":{"twImgId":"","twTitle":"","ogTitle":"","ogImgId":"","twDescription":"","description":"As mobile learning becomes more common, district leaders are working hard to juggle nimble adaptation in a changing environment and the desire to get it right.","title":"5 Essential Insights About Mobile Learning | KQED","ogDescription":"","schema":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Article","headline":"5 Essential Insights About Mobile Learning","datePublished":"2014-07-15T07:00:20-07:00","dateModified":"2014-07-15T07:30:42-07:00","image":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KQED-OG-Image@1x.png"}},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"5-essential-insights-about-mobile-learning","status":"publish","path":"/mindshift/35726/5-essential-insights-about-mobile-learning","audioTrackLength":null,"parsedContent":[{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_36709\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-36709\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061.jpg\" alt=\"Erin Scott/MindShift\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061.jpg 640w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061-400x225.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/07/erinscott_-7061-320x180.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erin Scott/MindShift\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp class=\"dropcap-serif\">Just a few years ago, mobile devices were almost unheard of in classrooms.

Think about equity, but don&rsquo;t let it stop forward motion.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While some districts deal with more poverty than others, equity concerns are part of every school administrator&rsquo;s job. Many districts that pioneered mobile learning programs did so because they wanted to offer more equal access to the benefits of anytime-anywhere access to knowledge that computers offer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"When you give every student a device, it levels that playing field, but there are still inequities,&rdquo; Smith said. His district charges each student a $50 tech fee per year. A local education foundation has agreed to pay for families who can&rsquo;t afford the fee, but about half of the families eligible for free and reduced price lunch still pay the fee because they recognize its importance for their children, Smith said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For many districts embracing a 24-7 mobile learning program, the toughest equity challenge is getting every student access to the internet at home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been trying to build lots of partnerships,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. Her district \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/think-big-how-to-jumpstart-tech-use-in-low-income-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">includes both urban and rural areas\u003c/a>, each of which have access issues. The district has been mapping resources that already exist, convincing cities to extend their programs if they are offering free internet in downtown business districts, and making sure students and parents know how to save resources for offline use.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Most of our kids are bringing a device to school, so we&rsquo;ve just been able to supplement what students bring in with school owned technology,&rdquo; Clark said. His students go back and forth between school-owned devices and their own, depending on need and in case of battery failure or other technical difficulties. It&rsquo;s become a very fluid process, he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>4. Evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile learning initiative based on the goals set at the beginning of the rollout.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s easy to use improved test scores as a measure of whether a mobile learning initiative has been successful, but school leaders recommend trying to evaluate the goals set forth in the original vision and to think about evaluation holistically. If one element of a district&rsquo;s vision is to put more power to direct learning in the hands of students, test scores aren&rsquo;t the most appropriate measure of that goal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Everybody wants to look at test scores because that&rsquo;s a measurable goal that everyone understands, but there are other things that you can use to evaluate success,&rdquo; Smith said. His district is in the sixth year of implementation and has found that graduation rates, attendance rates and academic success are all up. Meanwhile discipline issues and dropout rates are down. &ldquo;Is that all because of technology? Absolutely not, but it is certainly a contributing factor for being able to meet all students where they are,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s also tempting to expect results immediately, but leaders recommended allowing three to four years for educators and parents to grow into the program before expecting to see its value.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>5. Some of the biggest lessons learned include giving up control and trusting students.\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;A lot of our shifts are making sure we are not mandating any more than we have to and that we&rsquo;re empowering as much as we can,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. She found that once devices were in the hands of teachers and students there was far more potential for creativity and student empowerment than district officials had imagined. The district has been working to get out of the way of that generative energy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;One of the things I would do early is bring the students into the process because I think their insights are pretty powerful and sometimes surprising in the way they think about things,&rdquo; Bourgeois said. If she could re-do her rollout she would have \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/06/students-speak-up-trust-us-with-devices/\" target=\"_blank\">included students in the discussions\u003c/a> long before devices were chosen or in classrooms. They are stakeholders in their own education, but often aren&rsquo;t included in the decisions that will directly affect their daily instruction.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Over time you start to really focus in on what students are doing and learning with those devices and then where is the rigor of instruction and where is the authenticity of instructional tasks,&rdquo; Clark said. He noted that it's natural for schools to worry about the technical aspects of a rollout, but the novelty of the devices wears off quickly and when it does the whole school community can become even more focused on how to use the devices to offer the best learning opportunities possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>STAY NIMBLE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While these mobile learning pioneers have seen some of the pitfalls and can help districts new to the game avoid the same stumbles, this space is changing quickly and every community&rsquo;s needs will be different.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer just something you implement; it&rsquo;s evolving and it&rsquo;s unique in each location,&rdquo; Bjerede said. &ldquo;If you try to be cookie cutter about it you won&rsquo;t meet the needs of every kid in every classroom.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The technology will change, students will surprise their teachers and the best advice to district leaders is to stay open to all the possibilities and allow students to take control of the tremendous learning opportunity that having a device at all times could offer them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/35726/5-essential-insights-about-mobile-learning","authors":["234"],"categories":["mindshift_195"],"tags":["mindshift_484","mindshift_20906","mindshift_544","mindshift_1040","mindshift_187"],"featImg":"mindshift_36709","label":"mindshift"},"mindshift_35270":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_35270","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"35270","score":null,"sort":[1402322456000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"mindshift"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1402322456,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"Why Aren't More Schools Using Free, Open Tools?","title":"Why Aren't More Schools Using Free, Open Tools?","headTitle":"MindShift | KQED News","content":"\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_35272\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bionicteaching/4700359343/\">\u003cimg class=\"wp-image-35272 size-full\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/04/computing.jpg\" alt=\"computing\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/04/computing.jpg 640w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/04/computing-400x225.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/04/computing-320x180.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\u003c/a>\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tom Woodward/Flickr\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp class=\"dropcap-serif\">The promise of using technology in school technology has been to give students more control over their learning, while helping teachers provide tailored instruction to individual student needs. \"Personalized learning\" has been the common rhetoric driving most one-to-one device initiatives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The stated goal is to make learning more of an individual experience, but many schools have chosen to implement technology programs in fairly regimented ways -- for lots of different reasons.

Reisinger estimates that going with an open-source operating system has saved the district $360,000 in just the first year of the program and his dedication to Linux machines has saved closer to $750,000 over the ten years he&rsquo;s been with the district.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[contextly_sidebar id=\"59b4cadb358270cee5020acc13c33608\"]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The difference is with a device such as this, it&rsquo;s unlocked and kids have administrative level accounts on their laptops,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;So where our formal instruction ends, their new learning can begin because they have control over the device.&rdquo; Students can download and load anything they want -- and Reisinger even encourages them to do so. He&rsquo;s not worried about them breaking the system because of its flexibility and wants them to learn from mistakes, if they do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger is baffled by the behavior of districts like \u003ca href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/01/local/la-me-1002-lausd-ipads-20131002\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles\u003c/a>, which rolled out a one-to-one iPad program and then revoked student privileges when kids figured out how to navigate around district filters. &ldquo;On the one hand we&rsquo;re handing kids amazing learning devices, perhaps one of the most amazing inventions of the past 100 years, but yet we&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t learn about it, we don&rsquo;t want you to understand how it works,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Treating devices that way makes students and teachers dependent on programmers for their needs, rather than letting them learn what&rsquo;s under the hood. Penn Manor teachers assign work on devices to help kids meet learning standards just like teachers everywhere else, but they also have more options to let the kids explore safely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;While we have the 'must do' layer, there&rsquo;s also that little bit of subversion here, giving kids that little bit of creativity and maybe a ray of hope,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;I want them to learn that learning is not all about what someone else preordains for you. It&rsquo;s OK to tinker and play with things.&rdquo; Penn Manor is as beholden to performing well on state tests as any other school district and its teachers make sure to cover curriculum, even using a few third party software programs to provide remedial help.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Reisinger says in addition to the advantage students have by just having access to their own laptops, students are becoming curious about the world of computing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing these little sprouts of discovery and problem solving that they never would have been about to do if we&rsquo;d given them a locked down device,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>STUDENTS DESIGN CLASSROOM SOLUTIONS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Penn Manor was rolling out its one-to-one high school laptop program in January, a core group of students who had already showed an interest in computer science played an integral role. A few juniors and seniors who had been interning with the IT department over the summers helped configure laptops and served as support to their peers on hardware issues. They essentially became part of the IT team.\u003c/p>\n\u003caside class=\"pullquote alignleft\">\"If this program is truly for and about our kids then why would we not want to put them in the drivers seat and make them the engineers?\"\u003c/aside>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we did a little differently is we structured the help desk into an actual course, so they could do this type of work,&rdquo; Reisinger said. Schools often have students staff this kind of help desk before or after school, but Reisinger felt that making it a class would legitimize the effort and make the students a part of his team. Students are even designing programming solutions to problems that arise in class.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Teachers were complaining that they wanted a simple way to share files and links within the classroom, like a private Twitter app. Rather than having IT professionals respond to the request, Reisinger&rsquo;s students programmed a solution that they call Paper Plane. &rdquo;Those kids have code up on GitHub [a site for open-source code] right now that they&rsquo;re sharing out,&rdquo; Reisinger said. Students also designed the help ticketing software that their peers use to request IT support.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger is aware that his computer science interns don&rsquo;t represent the whole student body and that not every student is taking advantage of their open devices to become programmers. But a few are. &ldquo;Every district has talent like that,&rdquo; he said. The systems just have to support them to let those talents shine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IS OPEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A lot of people are scared away from open-source software or operating systems like Linux because of the belief that they are harder for teachers and students to use, and are more challenging to support. Reisinger hasn&rsquo;t found that to be true for his district. &ldquo;If you look at the learning opportunities in the free and open source community there is so much out there and the community is incredibly friendly,&rdquo; he said. He gave students and teachers a 10-minute tutorial to their Ubuntu devices and that was all they needed.\u003c/p>\n\u003caside class=\"pullquote alignleft\">\"I want them to learn that learning is not all about what someone else preordains for you.\"\u003c/aside>\n\u003cp>Reisinger thinks a bigger reason people don&rsquo;t go open-source is that the devices and software aren&rsquo;t as shiny and exciting as iPads or Chromebooks. &ldquo;Schools are sometimes so afraid to try things that are outside the box because they&rsquo;ll be met with fierce criticism,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to follow a path that hasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; been well trodden.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aside from the cost savings Penn Manor has found by using open-source software whenever possible the district also owns all its student data, so \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/04/16/28privacy_ep.h33.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent concerns regarding third party providers and privacy\u003c/a> are less of an issue. &ldquo;We have control of our destiny this way,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Penn Manor uses open-source solutions like \u003ca href=\"https://moodle.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moodle\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress\u003c/a>, companies that have built their businesses on providing support rather than on tracking data. The district is also able to customize the software, a service many schools complain they can&rsquo;t get from third party providers. &ldquo;If we need to make tweaks to it, we own it, it lives on our servers and we can make changes we need,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s also very expensive to change providers once a school has chosen one because all a school&rsquo;s data is in that system and it can&rsquo;t be easily removed and transferred. That puts districts in the difficult position of being married to the first vendor they choose.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WHY DON&rsquo;T MORE DISTRICTS GO OPEN?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There could be a lot of reasons more districts aren&rsquo;t following the Penn Manor path. In many cases districts haven&rsquo;t even heard of the open-source options available. In others, there&rsquo;s a perception that getting something for free inherently means it will be a worse product.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In other places, giving students the most expensive, shiniest device might be a point of pride. &ldquo;We wanted our students to have the best of the best,&rdquo; said Dr. Darryl Adams, Superintendent of \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/10/rolling-out-an-ipad-pilot-program-with-eyes-wide-open/\" target=\"_blank\">Coachella Valley Unified School District\u003c/a>. This is a very poor district. Every child gets free and reduced priced lunch and yet voters passed a $42 million bond in 2012 to provide technology to schools. In the eyes of this district&rsquo;s students, Apple products are the best.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very proud,&rdquo; Adams said. &ldquo;There are two other districts in the valley that are more affluent, but they don&rsquo;t have what our kids have.&rdquo; The district also chose iPads because it liked Apple&rsquo;s iLife products and wanted teachers to have access to the app store with its many education resources. &ldquo;We felt like the benefits outweighed the cost,&rdquo; Adams said. &ldquo;We wanted something more systematic.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hillview Middle School in the much more affluent Menlo Park School District had \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/what-will-it-take-for-ipads-to-upend-teaching-and-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">similar reasons for choosing iPads\u003c/a>. &ldquo;Currently, and things are changing, the iPad education app store is far more advanced, mature, bugless and ubiquitous than the others,&rdquo; said Eric Burmeister, principal of Hillview Middle School. At his school all app downloads have to be approved and initiated by the IT department, so all the devices have the same resources on them. The central system knows immediately if a student has tampered with any of the internet filter settings or tried to download something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Burmeister said he chose tablets instead of laptops because he felt the touch screen was intuitive to \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/what-students-think-about-using-ipads-in-school/\" target=\"_blank\">students and the devices\u003c/a> could do just as much as laptops in terms of video editing and other creation tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet another district, Oakland Unified, chose Chromebooks, deciding that the most important resource for students is the internet and the many programs and applications found there. Relying on the internet allows schools to make individual decisions about when and where to spend money on other online tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay for anything until you&rsquo;ve gone to one end of the internet and back and decided that it either doesn&rsquo;t exist for free or it doesn&rsquo;t exist in the way you really need it to in terms of functionality and support,&rdquo; said Killian Betlach, principal of Elmhurst Community Prep, a Title I school. &ldquo;There is so much out there.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s confident with a strong internet connection his teachers can do a lot to support their student&rsquo;s learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger understands concerns of other districts, but can&rsquo;t help thinking they are overlooking powerful, low cost tools in the open community. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much emphasis on the new and shiny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And in some ways we&rsquo;re going back to the start, letting kids work on computing and programming, it&rsquo;s not that sexy.&rdquo; For him, the big differentiators is the freedom to explore and build meaningful products without being cut off from the underlying code.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If this program is truly for and about our kids then why would we not want to put them in the drivers seat and make them the engineers?&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"35270 http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=35270","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/06/09/why-arent-more-schools-using-free-open-education-resources/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":2089,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":35},"modified":1402340065,"excerpt":"One school in Pennsylvania is using open-source tools wherever possible to keep students close to the code behind the machines they use.

Are schools missing a key element of the technology revolution in schools, a moment for real change, by locking down computing systems and by default ensuring students remain tech-users, not creators?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>A PIRATE ISLAND DISTRICT\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A district in Pennsylvania is flying in the face of the trend towards closed systems, instead choosing open source devices and software whenever possible. &ldquo;We sometimes feel like a pirate island because this is unusual,&rdquo; said Charlie Reisinger, technology director for \u003ca href=\"http://www.pennmanor.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Penn Manor School District in Pennsylvania\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The district recently gave all \u003ca href=\"http://www.pennmanor.net/techblog/?page_id=1561\" target=\"_blank\">1,700 high school students laptops\u003c/a> running \u003ca href=\"http://insights.ubuntu.com/case-study/an-ubuntu-pc-for-everyone-in-penn-manor-school-district-pennsylvania-usa/\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu operating systems\u003c/a>, an easy-to-use version of the open source product Linux. Reisinger estimates that going with an open-source operating system has saved the district $360,000 in just the first year of the program and his dedication to Linux machines has saved closer to $750,000 over the ten years he&rsquo;s been with the district.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The difference is with a device such as this, it&rsquo;s unlocked and kids have administrative level accounts on their laptops,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;So where our formal instruction ends, their new learning can begin because they have control over the device.&rdquo; Students can download and load anything they want -- and Reisinger even encourages them to do so. He&rsquo;s not worried about them breaking the system because of its flexibility and wants them to learn from mistakes, if they do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger is baffled by the behavior of districts like \u003ca href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/01/local/la-me-1002-lausd-ipads-20131002\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles\u003c/a>, which rolled out a one-to-one iPad program and then revoked student privileges when kids figured out how to navigate around district filters. &ldquo;On the one hand we&rsquo;re handing kids amazing learning devices, perhaps one of the most amazing inventions of the past 100 years, but yet we&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t learn about it, we don&rsquo;t want you to understand how it works,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Treating devices that way makes students and teachers dependent on programmers for their needs, rather than letting them learn what&rsquo;s under the hood. Penn Manor teachers assign work on devices to help kids meet learning standards just like teachers everywhere else, but they also have more options to let the kids explore safely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;While we have the 'must do' layer, there&rsquo;s also that little bit of subversion here, giving kids that little bit of creativity and maybe a ray of hope,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;I want them to learn that learning is not all about what someone else preordains for you. It&rsquo;s OK to tinker and play with things.&rdquo; Penn Manor is as beholden to performing well on state tests as any other school district and its teachers make sure to cover curriculum, even using a few third party software programs to provide remedial help.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But Reisinger says in addition to the advantage students have by just having access to their own laptops, students are becoming curious about the world of computing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing these little sprouts of discovery and problem solving that they never would have been about to do if we&rsquo;d given them a locked down device,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>STUDENTS DESIGN CLASSROOM SOLUTIONS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Penn Manor was rolling out its one-to-one high school laptop program in January, a core group of students who had already showed an interest in computer science played an integral role. A few juniors and seniors who had been interning with the IT department over the summers helped configure laptops and served as support to their peers on hardware issues. They essentially became part of the IT team.\u003c/p>\n\u003caside class=\"pullquote alignleft\">\"If this program is truly for and about our kids then why would we not want to put them in the drivers seat and make them the engineers?\"\u003c/aside>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we did a little differently is we structured the help desk into an actual course, so they could do this type of work,&rdquo; Reisinger said. Schools often have students staff this kind of help desk before or after school, but Reisinger felt that making it a class would legitimize the effort and make the students a part of his team. Students are even designing programming solutions to problems that arise in class.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Teachers were complaining that they wanted a simple way to share files and links within the classroom, like a private Twitter app. Rather than having IT professionals respond to the request, Reisinger&rsquo;s students programmed a solution that they call Paper Plane. &rdquo;Those kids have code up on GitHub [a site for open-source code] right now that they&rsquo;re sharing out,&rdquo; Reisinger said. Students also designed the help ticketing software that their peers use to request IT support.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger is aware that his computer science interns don&rsquo;t represent the whole student body and that not every student is taking advantage of their open devices to become programmers. But a few are. &ldquo;Every district has talent like that,&rdquo; he said. The systems just have to support them to let those talents shine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>IS OPEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A lot of people are scared away from open-source software or operating systems like Linux because of the belief that they are harder for teachers and students to use, and are more challenging to support. Reisinger hasn&rsquo;t found that to be true for his district. &ldquo;If you look at the learning opportunities in the free and open source community there is so much out there and the community is incredibly friendly,&rdquo; he said. He gave students and teachers a 10-minute tutorial to their Ubuntu devices and that was all they needed.\u003c/p>\n\u003caside class=\"pullquote alignleft\">\"I want them to learn that learning is not all about what someone else preordains for you.\"\u003c/aside>\n\u003cp>Reisinger thinks a bigger reason people don&rsquo;t go open-source is that the devices and software aren&rsquo;t as shiny and exciting as iPads or Chromebooks. &ldquo;Schools are sometimes so afraid to try things that are outside the box because they&rsquo;ll be met with fierce criticism,&rdquo; Reisinger said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to follow a path that hasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; been well trodden.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aside from the cost savings Penn Manor has found by using open-source software whenever possible the district also owns all its student data, so \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/04/16/28privacy_ep.h33.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent concerns regarding third party providers and privacy\u003c/a> are less of an issue. &ldquo;We have control of our destiny this way,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Penn Manor uses open-source solutions like \u003ca href=\"https://moodle.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moodle\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress\u003c/a>, companies that have built their businesses on providing support rather than on tracking data. The district is also able to customize the software, a service many schools complain they can&rsquo;t get from third party providers. &ldquo;If we need to make tweaks to it, we own it, it lives on our servers and we can make changes we need,&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It&rsquo;s also very expensive to change providers once a school has chosen one because all a school&rsquo;s data is in that system and it can&rsquo;t be easily removed and transferred. That puts districts in the difficult position of being married to the first vendor they choose.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WHY DON&rsquo;T MORE DISTRICTS GO OPEN?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There could be a lot of reasons more districts aren&rsquo;t following the Penn Manor path. In many cases districts haven&rsquo;t even heard of the open-source options available. In others, there&rsquo;s a perception that getting something for free inherently means it will be a worse product.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In other places, giving students the most expensive, shiniest device might be a point of pride. &ldquo;We wanted our students to have the best of the best,&rdquo; said Dr. Darryl Adams, Superintendent of \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2013/10/rolling-out-an-ipad-pilot-program-with-eyes-wide-open/\" target=\"_blank\">Coachella Valley Unified School District\u003c/a>. This is a very poor district. Every child gets free and reduced priced lunch and yet voters passed a $42 million bond in 2012 to provide technology to schools. In the eyes of this district&rsquo;s students, Apple products are the best.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very proud,&rdquo; Adams said. &ldquo;There are two other districts in the valley that are more affluent, but they don&rsquo;t have what our kids have.&rdquo; The district also chose iPads because it liked Apple&rsquo;s iLife products and wanted teachers to have access to the app store with its many education resources. &ldquo;We felt like the benefits outweighed the cost,&rdquo; Adams said. &ldquo;We wanted something more systematic.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hillview Middle School in the much more affluent Menlo Park School District had \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/what-will-it-take-for-ipads-to-upend-teaching-and-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">similar reasons for choosing iPads\u003c/a>. &ldquo;Currently, and things are changing, the iPad education app store is far more advanced, mature, bugless and ubiquitous than the others,&rdquo; said Eric Burmeister, principal of Hillview Middle School. At his school all app downloads have to be approved and initiated by the IT department, so all the devices have the same resources on them. The central system knows immediately if a student has tampered with any of the internet filter settings or tried to download something.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Burmeister said he chose tablets instead of laptops because he felt the touch screen was intuitive to \u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/what-students-think-about-using-ipads-in-school/\" target=\"_blank\">students and the devices\u003c/a> could do just as much as laptops in terms of video editing and other creation tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet another district, Oakland Unified, chose Chromebooks, deciding that the most important resource for students is the internet and the many programs and applications found there. Relying on the internet allows schools to make individual decisions about when and where to spend money on other online tools.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay for anything until you&rsquo;ve gone to one end of the internet and back and decided that it either doesn&rsquo;t exist for free or it doesn&rsquo;t exist in the way you really need it to in terms of functionality and support,&rdquo; said Killian Betlach, principal of Elmhurst Community Prep, a Title I school. &ldquo;There is so much out there.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s confident with a strong internet connection his teachers can do a lot to support their student&rsquo;s learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisinger understands concerns of other districts, but can&rsquo;t help thinking they are overlooking powerful, low cost tools in the open community. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much emphasis on the new and shiny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And in some ways we&rsquo;re going back to the start, letting kids work on computing and programming, it&rsquo;s not that sexy.&rdquo; For him, the big differentiators is the freedom to explore and build meaningful products without being cut off from the underlying code.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If this program is truly for and about our kids then why would we not want to put them in the drivers seat and make them the engineers?&rdquo; Reisinger said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/35270/why-arent-more-schools-using-free-open-education-resources","authors":["234"],"categories":["mindshift_192"],"tags":["mindshift_1040","mindshift_81","mindshift_187","mindshift_159","mindshift_76"],"featImg":"mindshift_35272","label":"mindshift"},"mindshift_34469":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_34469","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"34469","score":null,"sort":[1394652703000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"mindshift"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1394652703,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"Should Handheld Devices for Kids Under 12 Be Banned?

However, while it does have an impact in the classroom, the greatest impact still lies within the teacher and the content that they are trying to get their students to learn.&nbsp; Until the pedagogy and purpose align with this new world, we are all left fighting a battle rather than embracing it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Carl Hooker is the Director of Instructional Technology for Eanes ISD in Texas, an Apple Distinguished Educator, an EdTechTeacher consultant/trainer, and founder of iPadpalooza. \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/34336/how-real-world-technology-use-has-inflitrated-change-classrooms","authors":["4354"],"categories":["mindshift_195"],"tags":["mindshift_484","mindshift_1040","mindshift_187"],"featImg":"mindshift_34357","label":"mindshift"},"mindshift_33609":{"type":"posts","id":"mindshift_33609","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"mindshift","id":"33609","score":null,"sort":[1392303613000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"mindshift"},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1392303613,"format":"aside","disqusTitle":"What Will It Take for iPads to Upend Teaching and Learning?","title":"What Will It Take for iPads to Upend Teaching and Learning?","headTitle":"MindShift | KQED News","content":"\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_34055\" class=\"wp-caption left\" style=\"max-width: 640px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-34055\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-7078.jpg\" alt=\"Students at Hillview Elementary School use iPads in math class.\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-7078.jpg 640w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-7078-400x225.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-7078-320x180.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students at Hillview Elementary School use iPads in math class.\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp class=\"dropcap-serif\">As schools across the country consider\u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/01/macbook-chromebook-ipads-moving-beyond-platforms/\" target=\"_blank\"> which devices to invest in, \u003c/a>they must first consider their big-picture vision for how they'll be using these devices -- and to what end.

To start with, he wants them to see the device as a powerful learning tool, not a toy. &ldquo;I need them to see that this iPad is a powerful learning resource for them to get where they need to go,&rdquo; Kalen said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Before the school went one-to-one with iPads, Kalen sometimes had access to a shared laptop cart, but he couldn&rsquo;t depend on it being available for every lesson. He&rsquo;s excited to come into class, have kids open a home screen on the iPad and be ready to go, no intermediate steps or time lost. He expects to use apps like Socrative, a real-time polling app, and is already thinking about ways to get students practicing various parts of the writing process, like brainstorming, through different apps.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Efficiency and effectiveness are what it&rsquo;s all about with the iPads,&rdquo; Kalen said. &ldquo;For kids who struggle with disorganization the iPad is going to be a pretty effective organizational tool.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FRENCH CLASS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a small French class with only five or six students, the teacher helped her students familiarize themselves with their new iPads by screen casting a vocabulary exercise on the board. As students responded to the prompt, their answers popped up on the screen. The teacher could instantly see who understood her question &ndash; asked in French &ndash; and who was confused. Students also got immediate feedback on their answers and the class could discuss common mistakes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later, the teacher asked students to draw iPad sketches of the scene she described in French. Students were able to share their drawing with one another through the screencast, an especially useful too if the class had been bigger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TEACHING EXPERIENCE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For the most part, the teachers interviewed at Hillview are excited about the iPad program, but many are still figuring out what works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I need to be more efficient with what I&rsquo;ve got and I need to be more effective because the stakes have never been higher,&rdquo; said English teacher Michael Kalen. Even without iPads, Kalen is one of those charismatic teachers that brings so much enthusiasm and humor to his subject that it's hard to imagine any device would make him better at his job. But with Common Core State Standards on the near horizon, Kalen is worried about his ability to use class time efficiently. While the new standards cover less terrain, they expect a more comprehensive knowledge, Kalen said. He expects the iPad to put him on the same page as his students quickly each day, with no wasted time, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;ll be sacrificing any of the teacher tricks he&rsquo;s already learned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[contextly_sidebar id=\"85af74128693f76e020d359d22eddf91\"]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still about the relationship,&rdquo; Kalen said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still about building that creative confidence; it&rsquo;s still about getting kids to push themselves. And that&rsquo;s what I'm hoping this iPad will let us do.&rdquo; Kalen is most excited that students might feel inspired by the technology to demonstrate their knowledge in different ways. &ldquo;What I'm really enjoying about it now is that the products that kids create might all look very different, but the thinking and the synthesis of the ideas are all getting them to the same place,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Math teacher Michael Doroquez is also trying new things. This year when he gave a geometry review he turned it into a scavenger hunt with QR codes pasted around the school. &ldquo;The kids loved it because not only were they able to leave the classroom, but they were able to work with each other outside the class setting, and used the iPad, and walk around the school and do problems,&rdquo; Doroquez said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, the iPad has some limitations. &ldquo;I really want the iPad to be a tool for creating,&rdquo; Doroquez said. &ldquo;Right now it&rsquo;s just a receptacle to take notes.&rdquo; He expressed frustration at the limited apps available to him and at their cost. He wants to be more creative, but he&rsquo;s having a tough time getting there with the iPad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He complained that it is often hard to get outside data onto the iPad, like music for a video, for example. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Adobe all make products that work in separate ecosystems and aren&rsquo;t compatible with one another, making it hard for Doroquez to find the right resources to expand how he teaches.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_34059\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"max-width: 300px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-34059\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-71922-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"English teacher xx explains how the class will be using iPads.\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">English teacher Michael Kalen explains how the class will be using iPads.\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ENHANCING VS. TRANSFORMING LEARNING\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I think right now we&rsquo;re really focused on the enhancement piece, but we&rsquo;re excited to talk about the transformation piece,&rdquo; said principal Burmeister. The efficiencies afforded by putting notes online or submitting work digitally are good steps forward, said Burmeister. He&rsquo;s aware that most of his teachers are still exploring what can be done with the iPad and that some are further along than others in moving towards the kind of learning he&rsquo;d like to see. But he&rsquo;s willing to be patient.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Everybody knows where we&rsquo;re trying to get, but how each individual gets there and the speed at which they get there is different for every teacher,&rdquo; Burmeister said. One simple way that iPads are moving beyond enhancing and towards transforming learning at Hillview happens when students take notes on their English and social studies texts. With paper textbooks, kids aren&rsquo;t allowed to annotate what they&rsquo;re reading because then the book can&rsquo;t be used the following year for another student.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"It&rsquo;s being able to engage with the material in a really kinesthetic way,&rdquo; Burmeister said. &ldquo;The material is so sacred that it&rsquo;s not sacred, you can really dirty it up.&rdquo; Students appreciate this new ability too. &ldquo;It makes it a lot easier to study for quizzes because we can more easily find what we were going to say when we read something,&rdquo; said eighth grader Jenna Filbin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WHAT ABOUT COST?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The iPad program is a bit of a gamble, given its relative expense compared to other devices. The administration waited until the school moved to a brand new building that had been upgraded with fast wireless and broadband infrastructure, a crucial part of a successful implementation. Even so, students complain the internet doesn&rsquo;t always work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fast if there&rsquo;s one person using it,&rdquo; said eighth-grader Luke Stimbling. &ldquo;We have 800 students and if a large portion is doing a project then it takes forever to download a document to view.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Keeping that network running costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, but in addition, each iPad costs about $600, including the apps Hillview has chosen and keyboards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Burmeister is quick to point out that for that cost Hillview is already set up to have every student take Common Core assessments at the same time and that the costs of paper textbooks offset some of the initial technology investment. Hillview was able to go one-to-one because 10 percent of its operating budget comes from a parent-funded foundation, a luxury not all schools can boast.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Over time, what you&rsquo;re going to see is that not only are we enhancing these kids' education, but we&rsquo;re actually transforming it,&rdquo; Burmeister said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s actually going to look different than it looks now.&rdquo; Moving to Common Core offers the opportunity to dramatic rethink teaching and learning. There&rsquo;s no better time to shake up how teachers are thinking about their craft, Burmeister said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We want learning to be technology infused and digital learning to be just who we are, what we&rsquo;re about and what our students can do,&rdquo; Burmeister said. As the rest of the nation looks towards these kinds of investments, Hillview hopes to be positioned as a shining example of how to successfully pilot and implement a one-to-one program.\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"33609 http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/?p=33609","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/02/13/what-will-it-take-for-ipads-to-upend-teaching-and-learning/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":2296,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":38},"modified":1394652407,"excerpt":"One principal in an affluent Bay Area School is striving to do more than just \"enhance\" classroom learning with iPads.

To start with, he wants them to see the device as a powerful learning tool, not a toy. &ldquo;I need them to see that this iPad is a powerful learning resource for them to get where they need to go,&rdquo; Kalen said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Before the school went one-to-one with iPads, Kalen sometimes had access to a shared laptop cart, but he couldn&rsquo;t depend on it being available for every lesson. He&rsquo;s excited to come into class, have kids open a home screen on the iPad and be ready to go, no intermediate steps or time lost. He expects to use apps like Socrative, a real-time polling app, and is already thinking about ways to get students practicing various parts of the writing process, like brainstorming, through different apps.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Efficiency and effectiveness are what it&rsquo;s all about with the iPads,&rdquo; Kalen said. &ldquo;For kids who struggle with disorganization the iPad is going to be a pretty effective organizational tool.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>FRENCH CLASS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a small French class with only five or six students, the teacher helped her students familiarize themselves with their new iPads by screen casting a vocabulary exercise on the board. As students responded to the prompt, their answers popped up on the screen. The teacher could instantly see who understood her question &ndash; asked in French &ndash; and who was confused. Students also got immediate feedback on their answers and the class could discuss common mistakes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later, the teacher asked students to draw iPad sketches of the scene she described in French. Students were able to share their drawing with one another through the screencast, an especially useful too if the class had been bigger.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>TEACHING EXPERIENCE\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For the most part, the teachers interviewed at Hillview are excited about the iPad program, but many are still figuring out what works.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I need to be more efficient with what I&rsquo;ve got and I need to be more effective because the stakes have never been higher,&rdquo; said English teacher Michael Kalen. Even without iPads, Kalen is one of those charismatic teachers that brings so much enthusiasm and humor to his subject that it's hard to imagine any device would make him better at his job. But with Common Core State Standards on the near horizon, Kalen is worried about his ability to use class time efficiently. While the new standards cover less terrain, they expect a more comprehensive knowledge, Kalen said. He expects the iPad to put him on the same page as his students quickly each day, with no wasted time, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;ll be sacrificing any of the teacher tricks he&rsquo;s already learned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still about the relationship,&rdquo; Kalen said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still about building that creative confidence; it&rsquo;s still about getting kids to push themselves. And that&rsquo;s what I'm hoping this iPad will let us do.&rdquo; Kalen is most excited that students might feel inspired by the technology to demonstrate their knowledge in different ways. &ldquo;What I'm really enjoying about it now is that the products that kids create might all look very different, but the thinking and the synthesis of the ideas are all getting them to the same place,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Math teacher Michael Doroquez is also trying new things. This year when he gave a geometry review he turned it into a scavenger hunt with QR codes pasted around the school. &ldquo;The kids loved it because not only were they able to leave the classroom, but they were able to work with each other outside the class setting, and used the iPad, and walk around the school and do problems,&rdquo; Doroquez said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, the iPad has some limitations. &ldquo;I really want the iPad to be a tool for creating,&rdquo; Doroquez said. &ldquo;Right now it&rsquo;s just a receptacle to take notes.&rdquo; He expressed frustration at the limited apps available to him and at their cost. He wants to be more creative, but he&rsquo;s having a tough time getting there with the iPad.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He complained that it is often hard to get outside data onto the iPad, like music for a video, for example. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Adobe all make products that work in separate ecosystems and aren&rsquo;t compatible with one another, making it hard for Doroquez to find the right resources to expand how he teaches.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_34059\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"max-width: 300px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-34059\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2014/02/erinscott_-71922-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"English teacher xx explains how the class will be using iPads.\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">English teacher Michael Kalen explains how the class will be using iPads.\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>ENHANCING VS. TRANSFORMING LEARNING\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I think right now we&rsquo;re really focused on the enhancement piece, but we&rsquo;re excited to talk about the transformation piece,&rdquo; said principal Burmeister. The efficiencies afforded by putting notes online or submitting work digitally are good steps forward, said Burmeister. He&rsquo;s aware that most of his teachers are still exploring what can be done with the iPad and that some are further along than others in moving towards the kind of learning he&rsquo;d like to see. But he&rsquo;s willing to be patient.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Everybody knows where we&rsquo;re trying to get, but how each individual gets there and the speed at which they get there is different for every teacher,&rdquo; Burmeister said. One simple way that iPads are moving beyond enhancing and towards transforming learning at Hillview happens when students take notes on their English and social studies texts. With paper textbooks, kids aren&rsquo;t allowed to annotate what they&rsquo;re reading because then the book can&rsquo;t be used the following year for another student.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"It&rsquo;s being able to engage with the material in a really kinesthetic way,&rdquo; Burmeister said. &ldquo;The material is so sacred that it&rsquo;s not sacred, you can really dirty it up.&rdquo; Students appreciate this new ability too. &ldquo;It makes it a lot easier to study for quizzes because we can more easily find what we were going to say when we read something,&rdquo; said eighth grader Jenna Filbin.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>WHAT ABOUT COST?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The iPad program is a bit of a gamble, given its relative expense compared to other devices. The administration waited until the school moved to a brand new building that had been upgraded with fast wireless and broadband infrastructure, a crucial part of a successful implementation. Even so, students complain the internet doesn&rsquo;t always work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fast if there&rsquo;s one person using it,&rdquo; said eighth-grader Luke Stimbling. &ldquo;We have 800 students and if a large portion is doing a project then it takes forever to download a document to view.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Keeping that network running costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, but in addition, each iPad costs about $600, including the apps Hillview has chosen and keyboards.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Burmeister is quick to point out that for that cost Hillview is already set up to have every student take Common Core assessments at the same time and that the costs of paper textbooks offset some of the initial technology investment. Hillview was able to go one-to-one because 10 percent of its operating budget comes from a parent-funded foundation, a luxury not all schools can boast.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Over time, what you&rsquo;re going to see is that not only are we enhancing these kids' education, but we&rsquo;re actually transforming it,&rdquo; Burmeister said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s actually going to look different than it looks now.&rdquo; Moving to Common Core offers the opportunity to dramatic rethink teaching and learning. There&rsquo;s no better time to shake up how teachers are thinking about their craft, Burmeister said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We want learning to be technology infused and digital learning to be just who we are, what we&rsquo;re about and what our students can do,&rdquo; Burmeister said. As the rest of the nation looks towards these kinds of investments, Hillview hopes to be positioned as a shining example of how to successfully pilot and implement a one-to-one program.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/mindshift/33609/what-will-it-take-for-ipads-to-upend-teaching-and-learning","authors":["234"],"categories":["mindshift_195"],"tags":["mindshift_1040","mindshift_20620","mindshift_81","mindshift_187","mindshift_750"],"featImg":"mindshift_34055","label":"mindshift"}},"programsReducer":{"possible":{"id":"possible","title":"Possible","info":"Possible is hosted by entrepreneur Reid Hoffman and writer Aria Finger.
