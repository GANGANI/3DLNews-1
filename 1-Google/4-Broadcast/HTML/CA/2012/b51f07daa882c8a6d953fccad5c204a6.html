But now the merit of one of the most popular ideas in education has been thrown into confusion with the publication of two conflicting studies in the same highly respected journal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Each study is a meta-analysis, which means they are supposed to sweep up all the best research on a topic and use statistics to tell us where the preponderance of the evidence lies. How could two such studies come out within just three weeks of each other in \u003ca href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/bul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Psychological Bulletin\u003c/a> and arrive at opposite conclusions? Which one is right?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That question is currently the hottest topic in educational psychology. Scholars have been debating the conflicting claims by email and on Twitter. Some penned \u003ca>formal commentaries\u003c/a> on the debate. At least one commentary on the commentaries is in the works. (This is what happens when a scholarly controversy grows red hot.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The theory of growth mindset was developed by Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck over decades, and it exploded onto the education scene with her 2006 best-selling book, &ldquo;Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.&rdquo; In it, Dweck explained that students who believe their brains can change will be more motivated in their studies, take on greater challenges, persist through frustrations and ultimately thrive in school.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The optimistic philosophy had an intuitive appeal. Teachers ramped up their praise of student effort and tacked up motivational posters: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up until you are PROUD&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every mistake you make is PROGRESS.&rdquo; The concept spawned an industry of mindset consultants who explained neuroplasticity to educators and parents. Today, growth mindset is so accepted in education that it is infused into social-emotional lessons and even math books.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But scholars have wondered how much boosting your mindset really helps students.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One team of seven researchers led by Jeni Burnette, a psychologist at North Carolina State University, found that the results were wildly different for students across 53 studies published between 2002 and 2020. Sometimes students benefited a lot from a short online lesson about mindset and their grades rose. Often they didn&rsquo;t. In a few cases, student performance and well-being deteriorated after a mindset intervention.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In their final analysis, Burnette and her colleagues concluded that growth mindset interventions are helpful for \u003cem>some\u003c/em> but not all students. Low-achieving and disadvantaged students were most likely to benefit. High-achievers typically did not get a boost.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Despite the large variation in effectiveness,&rdquo; the researchers wrote, &ldquo;we found positive effects on academic outcomes, mental health, and social functioning, especially when interventions are delivered to people expected to benefit the most.&rdquo; Their paper, &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000368\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Growth Mindset Interventions: For Whom, How, and Why Might Such Interventions Work?\u003c/a>,&rdquo; published online Oct. 13, 2022 in Psychological Bulletin, a journal of the American Psychological Association.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then 21 days later, on Nov. 3, the same journal published a rival meta-analysis that concluded growth mindset interventions generally weren&rsquo;t effective at all. Case Western Reserve University psychologist Brooke Macnamara and her co-author criticized the majority of the 63 studies they found for being poorly designed or conducted by researchers who are advocates for growth mindset and have financial incentives to report positive outcomes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We conclude that apparent effects of growth mindset interventions on academic achievement are likely attributable to inadequate study design, reporting flaws, and bias,&rdquo; they wrote in their paper, entitled, &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Do Growth Mindset Interventions Impact Students&rsquo; Academic Achievement? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis With Recommendations for Best Practices\u003c/a>.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Northwestern University statistician Elizabeth Tipton weighed in on Nov. 7, declaring in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365186228_Why_Meta-Analyses_of_Growth_Mindset_and_Other_Interventions_Should_Follow_Best_Practices_for_Examining_Heterogeneity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online commentary\u003c/a> that the more flattering meta-analysis was the correct one: growth mindsets work for low-achievers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a statistician and I really don&rsquo;t care if growth mindset works or not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I do care about meta-analysis.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Tipton argues that results for different groups of students shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;smooshed&rdquo; together. To understand Tipton&rsquo;s logic, it&rsquo;s helpful to imagine growth mindset as a garden pesticide. One formula may help tomato plants thrive, but not lettuce or cucumbers. And it may have destroyed basil plants altogether.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;When you look across many people&rsquo;s gardens, it doesn&rsquo;t look like it works on average,&rdquo; said Tipton. &ldquo;But if you looked within everybody&rsquo;s gardens and looked only at tomatoes, you would realize that it actually did work.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To prove her point, Tipton recrunched all the data in the studies Macnamara had chosen using the methodology in the first Burnette meta-analysis and replicated the positive findings for low-income and low-achieving students. &ldquo;You get remarkably similar results,&rdquo; she said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Indeed, Macnamara herself found this same dichotomy between low and high achievers back in her first meta-analysis of growth mindset published in 2018. In that earlier study, she had a skeptical conclusion, that \u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/should-taxpayers-and-schools-invest-in-growth-mindset-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mindsets were unlikely to produce large, consistent benefits for students\u003c/a>. But her previous numbers were similar to those of Burnette and Tipton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Macnamara told me she didn&rsquo;t systematically review the quality of those older studies, as she has now, and there are now more than twice as many studies since she last looked in 2016. &ldquo;More data typically allows for better estimates,&rdquo; she said by email.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Macnamara said she is writing a formal response to Tipton&rsquo;s commentary. &ldquo;Their claims do not hold up to scrutiny and this will be borne out in our official reply,&rdquo; she wrote to me. She declined an interview because she said she didn&rsquo;t want to violate Psychological Bulletin&rsquo;s rules, which prohibit authors from talking to the media prior to peer review and publication.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As I went down this reporting rabbit hole, I began to understand that this scholarly debate is about far more than methodology; it&rsquo;s about whether you buy the theory of growth mindset itself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are legitimate questions about what exactly we mean by \u003ca href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/mp84a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growth mindset and its link to academic performance\u003c/a>, according to another commentary on the dueling meta-analyses by two educational psychologists at the University of Texas at Austin, Veronica Yan and Brendan Schuetze.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest problem is that the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; can mean different things to different people. Researchers who study intelligence tend to think of it as cognitive abilities, such as brain processing speed and memory, which are relatively stable over time. But lay people often think of intelligence as a mix of knowledge and skills, which we can readily gain, and &ldquo;is the purpose of schooling,&rdquo; Yan and Schuetze wrote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This ambiguity matters because growth mindset is measured through surveys by asking students how much they agree with statements such as, &ldquo;You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can&rsquo;t really do much to change it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your intelligence is something about you that you can&rsquo;t change very much,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You can learn new things, but you can&rsquo;t really change your basic intelligence.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Students who think of intelligence as a cognitive ability tend to produce lower growth mindset scores. But their mindset scores might have been much higher if they defined intelligence as the ability to learn new things and gain knowledge. So, growth mindset scores, which researchers use to prove their theories, may greatly depend on semantics and be unreliable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The connection between mindset and academic achievement can be a tenuous one. Some studies have found that students can hold a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; believing that intelligence is a fixed trait, but still feel that they can make up for a lack of innate intelligence by working hard. Perhaps a fixed mindset and strong academic achievement can go hand in hand, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Critics also question whether improvements in growth mindset are really driving the academic gains that are seen in studies. That&rsquo;s because many experiments have found that students&rsquo; grades can improve after an intervention even when their mindsets haven&rsquo;t changed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The confounding issue is that mindset interventions rarely focus on mindset alone, but combine it with other helpful tips, such as encouraging students to work hard, set goals and use strategies when facing challenges. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the other things that are included in a mindset intervention, but not growth mindset in and of itself, that are effective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is a tricky theoretical knot to unravel. Imagine that someone complimented your beauty and also suggested you get a haircut. Then a week later you are asked out on a date. Was it the praise or the haircut that gave you more confidence and made you more attractive?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mindset proponents argue that changing mindsets alone won&rsquo;t accomplish much by itself. The change in belief is only powerful if it is combined with productive ways to put a growth mindset into practice. Indeed, Dweck and other mindset researchers are now expanding their mindset interventions, not only to change students, but also to work with educators on changing how they teach, assign work and grade students. Mindset interventions are swelling into school reform.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I interviewed Dweck about the academic maelstrom over her work. She said that neither she nor any of the leading mindset researchers, as far as she knows, have a financial interest in growth mindset products. &ldquo;None of us make money from any product,&rdquo; Dweck said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dweck was a co-founder of Mindset Works, which sells mindset interventions and training programs to schools, but she said she divested &ldquo;years ago&rdquo; when she realized it was a conflict of interest. The company continues to tout that its products are based on Dweck&rsquo;s research and charges $50 or less per student for short online video lessons, but teacher training can run $1,000 per hour. There are also cheaper alternatives. Schools can obtain \u003ca href=\"https://www.perts.net/orientation/hg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mindset products and training\u003c/a> from a foundation-funded nonprofit, PERTS, at no cost.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dweck agrees that low-achieving students benefit far more than high achievers, who often see no academic boost in studies. But she says that&rsquo;s because academic gains are usually measured by grades. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit of a ceiling effect,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re getting As, you don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go. And also, if you&rsquo;re highly motivated already, you may not need a motivation booster.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, Dweck recommends that schools give the intervention to all students and not restrict it to low-achievers. She says that kids of all achievement levels can benefit in ways that grades do not capture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As evidence, Dweck cites the\u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1466-y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> largest single study of growth mindset\u003c/a> to date, published in 2019, in which more than 13,000 ninth graders across the nation were randomly assigned to receive a mindset boost.&nbsp; Though it primarily benefited low performers, even high-achieving students who watched short online lessons in ninth grade were more likely to take advanced math courses in 10th grade than high achievers who didn&rsquo;t watch the videos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In her own teaching practice, Dweck continues to give a mindset boost to Stanford University freshmen who take her fall seminar. &ldquo;They got into a lot of top schools, but as they enter this new environment, they need a mindset booster,&rdquo; said Dweck. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re struggling. They&rsquo;re blaming themselves. They&rsquo;re socially comparing themselves with others and judging themselves.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If education were studied in business schools, growth mindset would make for an ideal case study of what happens when an academic concept spreads through pop culture and explodes like wildfire. Growth mindset seems simple, but it&rsquo;s easy to misunderstand and \u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/growth-mindset-guru-carol-dweck-says-teachers-and-parents-often-use-her-research-incorrectly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">misapply\u003c/a>. Many of us, including academic scholars, have strong gut feelings on whether to accept or reject the theory. Researchers are still figuring out how best to incorporate the philosophy in schools. Classroom adoption has gotten ahead of the research and a healthy skepticism is warranted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, there is a growing body of evidence that these short, online interventions might convince low-performing teens to believe in themselves and their ability to learn. A shift in mindset isn&rsquo;t going to close the achievement gap; it&rsquo;s no silver bullet. We still need to improve how schools teach. But small psychological boosts like this might help some students on the margin. And that makes this field of research worth watching.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This story about \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-does-growth-mindset-matter-the-debate-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u003cem>growth mindset\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> was written by Jill Barshay and produced by \u003c/em>The Hechinger Report\u003cem>, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

But her previous numbers were similar to those of Burnette and Tipton.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Macnamara told me she didn&rsquo;t systematically review the quality of those older studies, as she has now, and there are now more than twice as many studies since she last looked in 2016. &ldquo;More data typically allows for better estimates,&rdquo; she said by email.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Macnamara said she is writing a formal response to Tipton&rsquo;s commentary. &ldquo;Their claims do not hold up to scrutiny and this will be borne out in our official reply,&rdquo; she wrote to me. She declined an interview because she said she didn&rsquo;t want to violate Psychological Bulletin&rsquo;s rules, which prohibit authors from talking to the media prior to peer review and publication.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As I went down this reporting rabbit hole, I began to understand that this scholarly debate is about far more than methodology; it&rsquo;s about whether you buy the theory of growth mindset itself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are legitimate questions about what exactly we mean by \u003ca href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/mp84a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growth mindset and its link to academic performance\u003c/a>, according to another commentary on the dueling meta-analyses by two educational psychologists at the University of Texas at Austin, Veronica Yan and Brendan Schuetze.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest problem is that the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; can mean different things to different people. Researchers who study intelligence tend to think of it as cognitive abilities, such as brain processing speed and memory, which are relatively stable over time. But lay people often think of intelligence as a mix of knowledge and skills, which we can readily gain, and &ldquo;is the purpose of schooling,&rdquo; Yan and Schuetze wrote.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This ambiguity matters because growth mindset is measured through surveys by asking students how much they agree with statements such as, &ldquo;You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can&rsquo;t really do much to change it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Your intelligence is something about you that you can&rsquo;t change very much,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You can learn new things, but you can&rsquo;t really change your basic intelligence.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Students who think of intelligence as a cognitive ability tend to produce lower growth mindset scores. But their mindset scores might have been much higher if they defined intelligence as the ability to learn new things and gain knowledge. So, growth mindset scores, which researchers use to prove their theories, may greatly depend on semantics and be unreliable.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The connection between mindset and academic achievement can be a tenuous one. Some studies have found that students can hold a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; believing that intelligence is a fixed trait, but still feel that they can make up for a lack of innate intelligence by working hard. Perhaps a fixed mindset and strong academic achievement can go hand in hand, too.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Critics also question whether improvements in growth mindset are really driving the academic gains that are seen in studies. That&rsquo;s because many experiments have found that students&rsquo; grades can improve after an intervention even when their mindsets haven&rsquo;t changed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The confounding issue is that mindset interventions rarely focus on mindset alone, but combine it with other helpful tips, such as encouraging students to work hard, set goals and use strategies when facing challenges. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the other things that are included in a mindset intervention, but not growth mindset in and of itself, that are effective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This is a tricky theoretical knot to unravel. Imagine that someone complimented your beauty and also suggested you get a haircut. Then a week later you are asked out on a date. Was it the praise or the haircut that gave you more confidence and made you more attractive?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mindset proponents argue that changing mindsets alone won&rsquo;t accomplish much by itself. The change in belief is only powerful if it is combined with productive ways to put a growth mindset into practice. Indeed, Dweck and other mindset researchers are now expanding their mindset interventions, not only to change students, but also to work with educators on changing how they teach, assign work and grade students. Mindset interventions are swelling into school reform.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I interviewed Dweck about the academic maelstrom over her work. She said that neither she nor any of the leading mindset researchers, as far as she knows, have a financial interest in growth mindset products. &ldquo;None of us make money from any product,&rdquo; Dweck said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dweck was a co-founder of Mindset Works, which sells mindset interventions and training programs to schools, but she said she divested &ldquo;years ago&rdquo; when she realized it was a conflict of interest. The company continues to tout that its products are based on Dweck&rsquo;s research and charges $50 or less per student for short online video lessons, but teacher training can run $1,000 per hour. There are also cheaper alternatives. Schools can obtain \u003ca href=\"https://www.perts.net/orientation/hg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mindset products and training\u003c/a> from a foundation-funded nonprofit, PERTS, at no cost.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Dweck agrees that low-achieving students benefit far more than high achievers, who often see no academic boost in studies. But she says that&rsquo;s because academic gains are usually measured by grades. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit of a ceiling effect,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re getting As, you don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go. And also, if you&rsquo;re highly motivated already, you may not need a motivation booster.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, Dweck recommends that schools give the intervention to all students and not restrict it to low-achievers. She says that kids of all achievement levels can benefit in ways that grades do not capture.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As evidence, Dweck cites the\u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1466-y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> largest single study of growth mindset\u003c/a> to date, published in 2019, in which more than 13,000 ninth graders across the nation were randomly assigned to receive a mindset boost.&nbsp; Though it primarily benefited low performers, even high-achieving students who watched short online lessons in ninth grade were more likely to take advanced math courses in 10th grade than high achievers who didn&rsquo;t watch the videos.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In her own teaching practice, Dweck continues to give a mindset boost to Stanford University freshmen who take her fall seminar. &ldquo;They got into a lot of top schools, but as they enter this new environment, they need a mindset booster,&rdquo; said Dweck. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re struggling. They&rsquo;re blaming themselves. They&rsquo;re socially comparing themselves with others and judging themselves.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If education were studied in business schools, growth mindset would make for an ideal case study of what happens when an academic concept spreads through pop culture and explodes like wildfire. Growth mindset seems simple, but it&rsquo;s easy to misunderstand and \u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/growth-mindset-guru-carol-dweck-says-teachers-and-parents-often-use-her-research-incorrectly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">misapply\u003c/a>. Many of us, including academic scholars, have strong gut feelings on whether to accept or reject the theory. Researchers are still figuring out how best to incorporate the philosophy in schools. Classroom adoption has gotten ahead of the research and a healthy skepticism is warranted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the same time, there is a growing body of evidence that these short, online interventions might convince low-performing teens to believe in themselves and their ability to learn. A shift in mindset isn&rsquo;t going to close the achievement gap; it&rsquo;s no silver bullet. We still need to improve how schools teach. But small psychological boosts like this might help some students on the margin. And that makes this field of research worth watching.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This story about \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-does-growth-mindset-matter-the-debate-heats-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u003cem>growth mindset\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> was written by Jill Barshay and produced by \u003c/em>The Hechinger Report\u003cem>, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

She started her academic career in pure math, expecting to get a Ph.D. But somewhere along the way she started to feel like it just wasn&rsquo;t for her, even though she was doing well in all her classes. Thinking that she&rsquo;d just chosen the wrong application for her love of math, Good switched to math education, where she first encountered the idea of stereotype threat from a guest psychology speaker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;As he talked about students feeling that they don&rsquo;t really belong, I had an epiphany,&rdquo; Good said. She realized the discomfort she&rsquo;d felt studying mathematics had nothing to do with her ability or qualifications and everything to do with a vague sense that she didn&rsquo;t belong in a field dominated by men. \u003ca href=\"http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stereotype threat\u003c/a> is a term coined by psychologists Joshua Aronson and Claude Steele. They found that pervasive cultural stereotypes that marginalize groups, like &ldquo;girls aren&rsquo;t good at math,&rdquo; create a threatening environment and affects academic achievement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Good was so fascinated by how powerful psychological forces can be on learning, including her own, that she switched fields again to study social psychology, and she ended up working closely with Carol Dweck for several years when Dweck&rsquo;s growth mindset work was in its early stages and not yet well-known among educators. Good now works at a psychology professor at \u003ca href=\"http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/psychology/cgood.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Baruch College\u003c/a>.* Originally, Dweck and Good hypothesized that believing intelligence is flexible -- what we now call a growth mindset -- could \u003ca href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0813817\" target=\"_blank\">protect students from stereotype threat\u003c/a>, an inherently fixed idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If students are first really encouraged and taught to believe in brain plasticity, our hypothesis was that they could be protected,&rdquo; Good said. While that hypothesis was shown to be true, Dweck and Good also began to uncover forces that seemed to undermine individual mindsets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we found was that students&rsquo; perception of what&rsquo;s going on in their learning environments are often more important than their own beliefs,&rdquo; Good said. In other words, if a classroom climate is one of fixed ability, it will override a student&rsquo;s own beliefs about his brain plasticity. This effect was even more pronounced when stereotype threat was present. Students were less likely to feel belonging and were less likely to engage with content. That, in turn, led to lower achievement and lower grades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;When you are looking at a long-term trajectory that&rsquo;s when the culture really becomes much more important,&rdquo; Good said -- especially in certain fields of study, like math and science, where stereotype threat exists and traditional classroom structures favor a laddered approach to learning that screens out the unworthy and is inherently sending fixed mindset messages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>APPLYING GROWTH MINDSET\u003cbr>\n\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A recent \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/media/ewrc_mindsetintheclassroom_sept2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Education Week Research Center survey\u003c/a> of 600 K-12 teachers nationwide found that over three-quarters of respondents felt &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; or &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; with growth mindset as a concept, and nearly all reported feeling it had a positive potential for teaching and learning. A large portion of respondents also connected growth mindset with a range of positive outcomes and behaviors, but only 20 percent felt strongly that they themselves were good at cultivating a growth mindset in their students. Still fewer had confidence in their colleagues and administrators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gap between awareness of growth mindset as a good thing to incorporate into the classroom and the confidence to actually do so, especially in specific courses, may be why \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/09/23/carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset.html\" target=\"_blank\">Carol Dweck and others are warning that growth mindset has been misinterpreted\u003c/a>, sometimes to ill effect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;People are much more likely to fall back on negative stereotypes with a naive understanding [of growth mindset],&rdquo; Good said. She described a study one of her graduate students recently completed that tested teachers' perspectives on student success. The graduate student gave one group of teachers an article to read that could be described as a &ldquo;pop culture&rdquo; understanding of growth mindset. The other group read a paper explaining that the most important way to increase student learning is for teachers to be reflective on their own pedagogical practices. Then that group reflected on new approaches they might try to help a struggling student.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Teachers who received only a broad brush understanding of growth mindset were less likely to reflect on their practice and more likely to shift blame back onto the struggling student for not having a growth mindset.

But when applied simplistically, both these takeaways can be damaging. For example, for a student who is trying hard, but not achieving success, being told to try harder could be demoralizing. And celebrating mistakes without taking time to reflect on new strategies to try again doesn&rsquo;t lead to the same learning gains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/\" target=\"_blank\">Confusion about growth mindset\u003c/a> and traditional structure of many classrooms are particularly apparent in math class, and to some extent science as well. As a former mathematician turned social psychologist with a deep interest in helping marginalized groups succeed and feel welcome in science, technology, engineering and math fields, Good has some specific ideas about how growth mindset could be incorporated into the fabric of math class.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CULTURE\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nThe first big obstacle is embedded in American culture.

Students follow the thinking in the problem, identify the mistakes and rework them. &ldquo;Embedded in that worked example is a lovely opportunity to talk about growth mindset and mistakes and process,&rdquo; Good said.\u003cbr>\n\u003cstrong>\u003cbr>\nTHINK LIKE A MATHEMATICIAN&nbsp;\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nSchool math has become almost entirely about demonstrating how to solve a problem, rather than actually engaging in \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/04/06/could-this-digital-math-tool-change-instruction-for-the-better/\" target=\"_blank\">the kind of problem-solving\u003c/a> that is at the heart of what professional mathematicians do. In other subject areas teachers encourage students to &ldquo;think like historians&rdquo; or to become writers. In those disciplines students create their own variations on expert texts and are encouraged to become practitioners. Not so in math. Good said the discussion around math should be about pushing through challenge, the same way real mathematicians do every day.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>RETHINK ASSESSMENTS\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nOne of the biggest ways math teachers can embed a growth mindset into the structure and environment of class is to change the role of assessment. Rather than taking tests whose scores accumulate into a final grade, students should get credit for \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/12/15/how-deprogramming-kids-from-how-to-do-school-could-improve-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">returning to problems they didn&rsquo;t get right\u003c/a>, recognizing their mistakes and reworking the problems. Growth over the course of the year should be rewarded. Students shouldn&rsquo;t be penalized in their final grade for doing poorly at the beginning of the year if they worked hard to learn the material over time. Assessments send very clear mindset messages that are far more powerful than anything a teacher says about growth mindset.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;Yes, we have to give assessments,&rdquo; Good said, &ldquo;Yes, we have to give grades. But when teachers say this grade doesn&rsquo;t mark you or indicate what you are capable of in the long term, it shifts the whole meaning of the assessment for students,&rdquo; Good said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She favors a \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/07/09/steps-to-help-schools-transform-to-competency-based-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">mastery approach\u003c/a> that allows students to go back, relearn concepts that they got wrong and earn points for that work, in part because it ensures students actually learn the material before moving on, but also because it is important for teaching a growth mindset. It shows the teacher has high expectations, but believes the students can succeed and will provide support as they work to understand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;This is where assessment can drive learning, but only if you go back and look at what you did and learn from it,&rdquo; Good said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>HELPFUL FEEDBACK\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nFeedback is one of the most effective ways to help a student grow, but teachers must be mindful that students will always receive critical feedback through the lens of their stereotype threat. Human brains are also wired to \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/04/14/how-to-get-past-negativity-bias-and-hardwire-positive-experiences/\" target=\"_blank\">pay more attention to negative inputs \u003c/a>than positive ones. When teachers couch feedback with assurances that they will continue to hold the student to high standards and that they know he can get there, it helps protect him from the stereotype.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the flip side, teachers who have fixed mindsets themselves are more likely to give comforting feedback meant to make the student feel better. Comments like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, let&rsquo;s look at where you do have strengths,&rdquo; are meant well, but communicate a fixed mindset to the student. &ldquo;Things we do for students to boost their self-esteem actually have these ironic effects of making students feel you don&rsquo;t believe in them,&rdquo; Good said.\u003cbr>\n\u003cstrong>\u003cbr>\nRETHINK ADVANCEMENT\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nGood sees the current practice of looking at math learning as a ladder with progressively more difficult rungs as a detrimental approach. It encourages teachers to \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/12/29/intro-college-science-classes-that-enable-instead-of-weed/\" target=\"_blank\">act as gatekeepers to higher- level classes\u003c/a>, funneling the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; kids into advanced courses and keeping out those who struggle. That in turn communicates low expectations and a fixed mindset about students&rsquo; abilities. Good said there should be multiple entry points, as opposed to a linear progression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>PREPARE&nbsp;EVERYONE\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>\nGrowth mindsets are often discussed in relationship to kids who struggle, but the concept is just as \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/03/17/can-focus-on-grit-work-in-school-cultures-that-reward-grades/\" target=\"_blank\">relevant to kids who breeze through the material\u003c/a>. Telling those kids they are smart is not setting them up for success later when they do struggle. For Good, that struggle didn&rsquo;t come until graduate school, but she distinctly remembers feeling &ldquo;not smart anymore&rdquo; because she was struggling. Math teachers need to give high achievers opportunities to struggle and persevere early and often so the experience is not foreign to them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Embedded in all of this growth mindset work is a general culture shift around how math is taught and who can excel at it. It&rsquo;s no surprise that teachers are struggling to integrate growth mindset into their teaching practice because every child is different. When it comes to perceptions of intelligence, belonging and whether a teacher cares, many factors come into play. Most teachers were educated in math classrooms with fixed mindset messages, as were\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/05/08/talking-about-failure-what-parents-can-do-to-motivate-kids-in-school/\" target=\"_blank\"> most parents\u003c/a>, so \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/09/24/never-too-late-creating-a-climate-for-adults-to-learn-new-skills/\" target=\"_blank\">shifting the culture of classrooms and schools \u003c/a>is work that takes time and incremental changes.

She started her academic career in pure math, expecting to get a Ph.D. But somewhere along the way she started to feel like it just wasn&rsquo;t for her, even though she was doing well in all her classes. Thinking that she&rsquo;d just chosen the wrong application for her love of math, Good switched to math education, where she first encountered the idea of stereotype threat from a guest psychology speaker.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;As he talked about students feeling that they don&rsquo;t really belong, I had an epiphany,&rdquo; Good said. She realized the discomfort she&rsquo;d felt studying mathematics had nothing to do with her ability or qualifications and everything to do with a vague sense that she didn&rsquo;t belong in a field dominated by men. \u003ca href=\"http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stereotype threat\u003c/a> is a term coined by psychologists Joshua Aronson and Claude Steele. They found that pervasive cultural stereotypes that marginalize groups, like &ldquo;girls aren&rsquo;t good at math,&rdquo; create a threatening environment and affects academic achievement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Good was so fascinated by how powerful psychological forces can be on learning, including her own, that she switched fields again to study social psychology, and she ended up working closely with Carol Dweck for several years when Dweck&rsquo;s growth mindset work was in its early stages and not yet well-known among educators. Good now works at a psychology professor at \u003ca href=\"http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/psychology/cgood.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Baruch College\u003c/a>.* Originally, Dweck and Good hypothesized that believing intelligence is flexible -- what we now call a growth mindset -- could \u003ca href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0813817\" target=\"_blank\">protect students from stereotype threat\u003c/a>, an inherently fixed idea.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If students are first really encouraged and taught to believe in brain plasticity, our hypothesis was that they could be protected,&rdquo; Good said. While that hypothesis was shown to be true, Dweck and Good also began to uncover forces that seemed to undermine individual mindsets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we found was that students&rsquo; perception of what&rsquo;s going on in their learning environments are often more important than their own beliefs,&rdquo; Good said. In other words, if a classroom climate is one of fixed ability, it will override a student&rsquo;s own beliefs about his brain plasticity. This effect was even more pronounced when stereotype threat was present. Students were less likely to feel belonging and were less likely to engage with content. That, in turn, led to lower achievement and lower grades.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"fullwidth"},"numeric":["fullwidth"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;When you are looking at a long-term trajectory that&rsquo;s when the culture really becomes much more important,&rdquo; Good said -- especially in certain fields of study, like math and science, where stereotype threat exists and traditional classroom structures favor a laddered approach to learning that screens out the unworthy and is inherently sending fixed mindset messages.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>APPLYING GROWTH MINDSET\u003cbr>\n\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A recent \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/media/ewrc_mindsetintheclassroom_sept2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Education Week Research Center survey\u003c/a> of 600 K-12 teachers nationwide found that over three-quarters of respondents felt &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; or &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; with growth mindset as a concept, and nearly all reported feeling it had a positive potential for teaching and learning. A large portion of respondents also connected growth mindset with a range of positive outcomes and behaviors, but only 20 percent felt strongly that they themselves were good at cultivating a growth mindset in their students. Still fewer had confidence in their colleagues and administrators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gap between awareness of growth mindset as a good thing to incorporate into the classroom and the confidence to actually do so, especially in specific courses, may be why \u003ca href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/09/23/carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset.html\" target=\"_blank\">Carol Dweck and others are warning that growth mindset has been misinterpreted\u003c/a>, sometimes to ill effect.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;People are much more likely to fall back on negative stereotypes with a naive understanding [of growth mindset],&rdquo; Good said. She described a study one of her graduate students recently completed that tested teachers' perspectives on student success. The graduate student gave one group of teachers an article to read that could be described as a &ldquo;pop culture&rdquo; understanding of growth mindset. The other group read a paper explaining that the most important way to increase student learning is for teachers to be reflective on their own pedagogical practices. Then that group reflected on new approaches they might try to help a struggling student.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Teachers who received only a broad brush understanding of growth mindset were less likely to reflect on their practice and more likely to shift blame back onto the struggling student for not having a growth mindset.

But when applied simplistically, both these takeaways can be damaging. For example, for a student who is trying hard, but not achieving success, being told to try harder could be demoralizing. And celebrating mistakes without taking time to reflect on new strategies to try again doesn&rsquo;t lead to the same learning gains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2015/11/16/growth-mindset-clearing-up-some-common-confusions/\" target=\"_blank\">Confusion about growth mindset\u003c/a> and traditional structure of many classrooms are particularly apparent in math class, and to some extent science as well.

Even a well-intentioned, comforting response of \"It's OK, you're still a great writer\" may send the message that it's time to give up on math rather than learn from the problems they got wrong, Haimovitz explains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She and Dweck conducted a series of smaller studies to explore how the interactions between parents' failure and intelligence mindsets affected their children's beliefs about intelligence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>First they interviewed 73 parents and their fourth- and fifth-grade children about their beliefs on failure and intelligence. The parents were mostly mothers with at least a college degree; they lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The questions focused on whether they viewed intelligence as something that could change and whether they saw failure as positive, facilitating growth and enhancing productivity or as negative, debilitating and inhibiting learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The way children perceived \"being smart\" was not related to how their parents perceived intelligence, but it was related to how their parents reacted toward failure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Parents who had more of a failure-is-debilitating mindset had children who were significantly more likely to believe that intelligence is fixed,\" they found, even after accounting for how parents perceived their children's academic success.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The more parents believed that failure is debilitating, the more likely their children were to see them as concerned with their performance outcomes and grades rather than their learning and improvement,\" the study found.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then the researchers surveyed 160 different parents online to find out how they would respond to their child coming home with a failing quiz grade. Those who saw failure as negative were more likely to worry about their child's abilities in that subject or to comfort their child about not being talented in all subjects. But parents who saw failure as an opportunity were more likely to ask their child what they learned from the quiz, what they still can learn and whether asking the teacher for help would be useful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Through two more surveys of 102 Bay Area parents and their children and 100 fourth- and fifth-grade students, the researchers found that children could correctly identify their parents' beliefs about failure but not necessarily about intelligence &mdash; and it was the former that matched up with the children's own beliefs about intelligence. Finally, the researchers conducted a randomized experiment with 132 parents to discover whether parents' failure beliefs directly cause their children's beliefs through parents' reactions to failure: they did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The takeaway is that when your child is struggling on something or has setbacks, don't focus on their abilities, focus on what they can learn from it,\" Haimovitz says. One way, she says, is to ask a child: \"How can you use this as a jumping-off point?\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it's unclear how much the study's findings relate to children of various ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Related research Heyman has done in China revealed a mixed bag in terms of results.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Cultures have very different beliefs about effort and ability, and asking subtly different questions you can get different answers,\" Heyman says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Whereas academic success often correlates with athletic or social success among white students, the same is not necessarily true among black or Latino students, according to \u003ca href=\"http://gero.usc.edu/faculty/abdou/\">Cleopatra Abdou\u003c/a>, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Southern California. What is consistent across cultures, however, is the powerful influence that beliefs people internalize as children follow them through life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The messages we get from our parents, whether explicitly or symbolically or subconsciously, stay with us and are very hard to unlearn and to overcome\" if they're not helpful, she says. \"Sometimes we have internalized faulty beliefs or beliefs that don't serve us.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Further, taking the learn-from-failure message too far might backfire eventually. \"If you're being told this message you can learn anything and you've done everything you can and you're not getting anywhere, then maybe at a certain point you say you're going to say I just don't believe this,\" she adds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Further, children's mindsets can also be influenced by their temperament, such as their tolerance for frustration, Heyman says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"One thing we do know in recent years, there's too much blaming of parents,\" Heyman says. \"Temperament is extremely important and it's biologically based, and to deny that causes all kinds of problems.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The challenge for parents is to support children without setting them up for failure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"There's this very difficult fine line between parents and teachers helping children enough so that they can do things on their own that they couldn't do otherwise but not to help them so much that they expect other people to do it for them and don't get pulled up to a higher level,\" Heyman says. \"You slowly pull back as the kids get better on their own, but not let them flail around so much that they get frustrated and give up.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Tara Haelle is the co-author of \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/473075468/the-informed-parent-a-science-based-resource-for-your-childs-first-four-years\">The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years\u003c/a>\u003cem>.

Even a well-intentioned, comforting response of \"It's OK, you're still a great writer\" may send the message that it's time to give up on math rather than learn from the problems they got wrong, Haimovitz explains.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She and Dweck conducted a series of smaller studies to explore how the interactions between parents' failure and intelligence mindsets affected their children's beliefs about intelligence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>First they interviewed 73 parents and their fourth- and fifth-grade children about their beliefs on failure and intelligence. The parents were mostly mothers with at least a college degree; they lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The questions focused on whether they viewed intelligence as something that could change and whether they saw failure as positive, facilitating growth and enhancing productivity or as negative, debilitating and inhibiting learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The way children perceived \"being smart\" was not related to how their parents perceived intelligence, but it was related to how their parents reacted toward failure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Parents who had more of a failure-is-debilitating mindset had children who were significantly more likely to believe that intelligence is fixed,\" they found, even after accounting for how parents perceived their children's academic success.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The more parents believed that failure is debilitating, the more likely their children were to see them as concerned with their performance outcomes and grades rather than their learning and improvement,\" the study found.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then the researchers surveyed 160 different parents online to find out how they would respond to their child coming home with a failing quiz grade. Those who saw failure as negative were more likely to worry about their child's abilities in that subject or to comfort their child about not being talented in all subjects. But parents who saw failure as an opportunity were more likely to ask their child what they learned from the quiz, what they still can learn and whether asking the teacher for help would be useful.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Through two more surveys of 102 Bay Area parents and their children and 100 fourth- and fifth-grade students, the researchers found that children could correctly identify their parents' beliefs about failure but not necessarily about intelligence &mdash; and it was the former that matched up with the children's own beliefs about intelligence. Finally, the researchers conducted a randomized experiment with 132 parents to discover whether parents' failure beliefs directly cause their children's beliefs through parents' reactions to failure: they did.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The takeaway is that when your child is struggling on something or has setbacks, don't focus on their abilities, focus on what they can learn from it,\" Haimovitz says. One way, she says, is to ask a child: \"How can you use this as a jumping-off point?\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But it's unclear how much the study's findings relate to children of various ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Related research Heyman has done in China revealed a mixed bag in terms of results.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"Cultures have very different beliefs about effort and ability, and asking subtly different questions you can get different answers,\" Heyman says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Whereas academic success often correlates with athletic or social success among white students, the same is not necessarily true among black or Latino students, according to \u003ca href=\"http://gero.usc.edu/faculty/abdou/\">Cleopatra Abdou\u003c/a>, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Southern California. What is consistent across cultures, however, is the powerful influence that beliefs people internalize as children follow them through life.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"The messages we get from our parents, whether explicitly or symbolically or subconsciously, stay with us and are very hard to unlearn and to overcome\" if they're not helpful, she says. \"Sometimes we have internalized faulty beliefs or beliefs that don't serve us.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Further, taking the learn-from-failure message too far might backfire eventually. \"If you're being told this message you can learn anything and you've done everything you can and you're not getting anywhere, then maybe at a certain point you say you're going to say I just don't believe this,\" she adds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Further, children's mindsets can also be influenced by their temperament, such as their tolerance for frustration, Heyman says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"One thing we do know in recent years, there's too much blaming of parents,\" Heyman says. \"Temperament is extremely important and it's biologically based, and to deny that causes all kinds of problems.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The challenge for parents is to support children without setting them up for failure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\"There's this very difficult fine line between parents and teachers helping children enough so that they can do things on their own that they couldn't do otherwise but not to help them so much that they expect other people to do it for them and don't get pulled up to a higher level,\" Heyman says. \"You slowly pull back as the kids get better on their own, but not let them flail around so much that they get frustrated and give up.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Tara Haelle is the co-author of \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/473075468/the-informed-parent-a-science-based-resource-for-your-childs-first-four-years\">The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child's First Four Years\u003c/a>\u003cem>.

We're not trying to make these mistakes in that we're not trying to do something incorrectly, but instead, we're trying to do something that is beyond what we already can do without help, so we're bound to make some errors.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Stretch mistakes are positive. If we never made stretch mistakes, it would mean that we never truly challenged ourselves to learn new knowledge or skills.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sometimes when we're stuck making and repeating the same stretch mistake, the issue may be that we're mindlessly going through the motions, rather than truly focusing on improving our abilities. Other times the root cause may be that our approach to learning is ineffective and we should try a different strategy to learn that new skill. Or it may be that what we're trying is too far beyond what we already know, and we're not yet ready to master that level of challenge. It is not a problem to test our boundaries and rate of growth, exploring how far and quickly we can progress. But if we feel stuck, one thing we can do is adjust the task, decreasing the level of challenge but still keeping it beyond what we already know. Our zone of proximal development (ZPD) is the zone slightly beyond what we already can do without help, which is a fruitful level of challenge for learning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We want to make stretch mistakes! We want to do so not by trying to do things incorrectly, but by trying to do things that are challenging. When we make stretch mistakes we want to reflect, identify what we can learn, and then adjust our approach to practice, until we master the new level of ability. Then we want to identify a new area of challenge and continue stretching ourselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>The aha-moment mistakes\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another positive type of mistake, but one that is harder to strive or plan for, is the aha-moment mistake. This happens when we achieve what we intend to do, but then realize that it was a mistake to do so because of some knowledge we lacked which is now becoming apparent. There are lots of examples of this, such as:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>When we lack the content knowledge: e.g. not finding water, we try to extinguish a fire with alcohol, which we didn't realize is flammable.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>When we find there is more nuance than we realized: e.g. in our painting, we color a sun near the horizon as yellow, and later notice that the sun does not always look yellow.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>When we make incorrect assumptions: e.g. we try to help someone else, thinking that help is always welcome, but we find out that the person did not want help at that moment.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>When we make systematic mistakes: e.g. a fellow educator observes us doing a lesson and later points out, with compelling back-up data, that we tend to call on Caucasian girls much more often than we do other students.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>When we misremember: e.g. we call a friend for their birthday on the right date, but the wrong month.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>We can gain more aha moments from mistakes by being reflective. We can ask ourselves What was unexpected? Why did that result occur? What went well and what didn't? Is there anything I could try differently next time?

We all make sloppy mistakes occasionally because we're human. However, when we make too many of these mistakes, especially on a task that we intend to focus on at the time, it signals an opportunity to enhance our focus, processes, environment, or habits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sometimes sloppy mistakes can be turned into aha moments. If we make a mistake because we're not focused on the task at hand, or we're too tired, or something distracted us, upon reflection we can gain aha-moments on how to improve, such as realizing we're better at certain tasks after a good night's sleep, or that if we silence our gadgets or close our doors we can focus better.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>The high-stakes mistakes\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sometimes we don't want to make a mistake because it would be catastrophic. For example, in potentially dangerous situations we want to be safe. A big mistake from the person in charge of security in a nuclear power plant could lead to a nuclear disaster. We don't want a school bus driver to take a risk going too fast making a turn, or a student in that bus to blindfold the bus driver. In those cases, we want to put processes in place to minimize high-stakes mistakes. We also want to be clear with students about why we don't want the risk-taking behavior and experimentation in these situations, and how they're different from learning-oriented tasks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aside from life-threatening situations, we can sometimes consider performance situations to be high-stakes. For example, if going to a prestigious college is important to someone, taking the SAT could be a high-stakes event because the performance in that assessment has important ramifications. Or if a sports team has trained for years, working very hard to maximize growth, a championship final can be considered a high-stakes event. It is okay to see these events as performance events rather than as learning events, and to seek to minimize mistakes and maximize performance in these events. We're putting our best foot forward, trying to perform as best as we can. How we do in these events gives us information about how effective we have become through our hard work and effort. Of course, it is also ok to embed learning activities in high-stakes events that don't involve safety concerns. We can try something that is beyond what we already know and see how it works, as long as we realize that it may impact our performance (positively or negatively). And of course, we can always learn from these performance events by afterwards reflecting and discussing how things went, what we could do differently next time, and how we could adjust our practice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In a high-stakes event, if we don't achieve our goal of a high test score or winning the championship, let's reflect on the progress we've made through time, on the approaches that have and haven't helped us grow, and on what we can do to grow more effectively. Then let's go back to spending most of our time practicing, challenging ourselves, and seeking stretch mistakes and learning from those mistakes. On the other hand, if we achieve our target score or win a championship, that's great. Let's celebrate the achievement and how much progress we've made. Then let's ask ourselves the same questions. Let's go back to spending most of our time practicing, challenging ourselves, and growing our abilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We're all fortunate to be able to enjoy growth and learning throughout life, no matter what our current level of ability is.

It leads people to take on challenges, persevere in the face of setbacks, and become more effective learners. As \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%22growth%20mindset%22\">more and more people learn about the growth mindset\u003c/a>, which was first discovered by Stanford Professor Carol Dweck, we sometimes observe some confusions about it. Recently some critiques have emerged. Of course we invite critical analysis and feedback, as it helps all of us learn and improve, but some of the recent commentary seems to point to misunderstandings of growth mindset research and practice. This article summarizes some common confusions and offers some reflections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Confusion #1: What a growth mindset is\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When we ask people to tell us what the growth mindset is, we often get lots of different answers, such as working hard, having high expectations, being resilient, or more general ideas like being open or flexible. But a growth mindset is none of those things. It is the belief that qualities can change and that we can develop our intelligence and abilities. The opposite of having a growth mindset is having a fixed mindset, which is the belief that intelligence and abilities cannot be developed. The reason that this definition of growth mindset is important is that research has shown that this specific belief leads people to take on challenges, work harder and more effectively, and persevere in the face of struggle, all of which makes people more successful learners. It is hard to directly change these behaviors without also working to change the underlying understanding of the nature of abilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Confusion #2: To foster a growth mindset, simply praise children for working hard\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A \u003ca href=\"https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Intelligence%20Praise%20Can%20Undermine%20Motivation%20and%20Performance_0.pdf\">body of research\u003c/a> has shown that telling children that they&rsquo;re smart and implying that their success depends on it fosters fixed mindsets. When these children later experience struggle, they tend to conclude that their ability is not high after all, and as a result they lose confidence, so our praise has the opposite effect of what we intended. On the other hand, praising hard work or strategies used, things that children control, has been shown to support a growth mindset.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This research was designed to learn more about \u003cem>one\u003c/em> of the ways to support a growth mindset, not to identify all there is to fostering a growth mindset. When people newer to the growth mindset framework initially learn about this research, they sometimes conclude that we should simply praise children for working hard. But this is a nascent level of understanding. First, exhorting students to work hard would be an attempt to directly change behaviors without changing the underlying belief about the nature of abilities. \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Second, students often haven&rsquo;t learned that working hard involves thinking hard, which involves reflecting on and changing our strategies so we become more and more effective learners over time, and we need to guide them to come to understand this. For example, a novice teacher who sees a student trying very hard but not making any progress may think &ldquo;well, at least she&rsquo;s working hard, so I&rsquo;ll praise her effort,&rdquo; but if the student continues to do what she&rsquo;s doing, or even more of it, it&rsquo;s unlikely to lead to success. Instead, the teacher can coach the student to try different approaches to working, studying, and learning, so that she is thinking more deeply (i.e. mentally working harder) to become a better learner, and of course the teacher should do the same: reflect on how to adjust instruction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about effort. You also need to learn skills that let you use your brain in a smarter way. . .&nbsp;&nbsp; to get better at something.&rdquo; (\u003ca href=\"http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ983023\">Yeager &amp; Dweck, 2012\u003c/a>.) \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Third, cultivating growth mindsets involves a gradual process of releasing responsibility to students for them to become more self-sufficient learners, and praise is a communications technique that tends to be more helpful earlier in that process of building agency. Later on, adults can ask students questions that prompt them to reflect, so that they&rsquo;re progressing down the path toward independence. \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Fourth, praise and coaching are not the only, or most powerful, ways to foster growth mindsets. For example, another method is modeling lifelong learning and making it visible, which gets us to the next confusion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Confusion #3: Growth mindset is about changing young people, not adults\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some recent criticisms paint growth mindset work as solely focused on the students and not the adults. This is a misunderstanding of what growth mindset efforts are about. In our work with educators, we encourage the adults to start with themselves. If we don&rsquo;t work to shift our own mindset about ourselves and our students, then we won&rsquo;t work to change many other important things in the system necessary to improve education. Furthermore, our efforts to foster growth mindsets in students are likely to fail because we will say and do things that reflect our fixed mindset beliefs, which students will notice. We must deeply explore mindsets within ourselves and then gradually work to develop our own growth mindsets and our habits as learners. This means authentically working to become better at what we do throughout our lives, including how we teach and how we create contexts that help students thrive, and making our learning process visible to one another and to students.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We encourage the schools we serve to train teachers early in their growth mindset efforts, involving reflections and discussions on adult beliefs and continuous improvement practices. We provide \u003ca href=\"http://www.mindsetworks.com/professional-development-and-tools/\">professional learning resources\u003c/a> to help them do so. Dr. Dweck and other mindset researchers speak about the importance of fostering a growth mindset in adults and have researched the mindsets of educators, managers, leaders, and other grownups. Growth mindset research is about learning how we humans can all become more motivated and effective learners, not about how we can change students but not ourselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Confusion #4: All that matters is what&rsquo;s in the mind\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another confusion about mindset is that the only determinant of success is our mindset. But that&rsquo;s not the case. Context, culture, environment, and systems matter. For one thing, people's mindsets (as well as other beliefs and behaviors) are strongly shaped by the people around them. Beyond that, people's destiny is not only a function of what's within them, but also of what's around them. A lot of the early mindset research studies focused on individual's minds because they were seeking to understand how humans work. But mindset researchers recognize, research, and speak about the importance of shifting culture, context, and systems, and both researchers and practitioners actively work on that aspect of change efforts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Confusion #5: Improvement is all about changing beliefs and not doing anything else\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Related to that, another confusion we see, also reflected in recent commentaries, is that growth mindset work is solely about fostering the belief that we can improve, but not about changing the educational system or actually doing anything about that belief. Carol Dweck has talked extensively about changing learning tasks, testing practices, and grading systems. Too many tasks and teaching approaches are superficial, irrelevant, unengaging, and not learner-centered. We do need to change these tasks, the curriculum, and the pedagogy. We need to change the idea that school is about testing rather than about learning. We also need to better tackle broader issues such as childhood trauma and lack of exposure to early reading. People who dive deeper into growth mindsets learn about how important these issues are and how we might begin to address them, and a growth mindset helps them take on the challenges. As David Yeager and Gregory Walton point out:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>[Mindset] interventions complement&mdash;and do not replace&mdash;traditional educational reforms. They do not teach students academic content or skills, restructure schools, or improve teacher training. Instead, they allow students to take better advantage of learning opportunities that are present in schools and tap into existing recursive processes to generate long-lasting effects . . . Indeed, [Mindset] interventions may make the effects of high-quality educational reforms such as improved instruction or curricula more apparent (\u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://rer.sagepub.com/content/81/2/267\">\u003cem>Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>).\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Deepening our understanding over time\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As with anything else, the deeper we go into mindsets, the deeper our understanding becomes. Over time, more nuanced questions arise, such as about the relationship between mindset and performance, results, failure, potential, assessments, mistakes, and many other things. For example, early on a teacher who is learning about mindset may start oversimplifying mistakes as always being &lsquo;good&rsquo;, but this can confuse learners, as mistakes are not always something we should seek to do.
