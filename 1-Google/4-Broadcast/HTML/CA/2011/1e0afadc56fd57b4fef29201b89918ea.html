<p>According to <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/04/hackers-break-into-fox-news-account-tweet-fake-obama-assassination-news/">Mashable</a> a hacker group calling themselves <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5817870/fox-news-twitter-account-hacked-claims-barack-obama-is-dead">Scriptkiddies</a> broke into the Fox News Politics twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/foxnewspolitics">@foxnewspolitics</a> on July 4th and started sending <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2011/07/foxnewspolitics-alltweets.jpg">fake tweets</a> about President Barack Obama being assassinated at Ross' Restaurant in Iowa. The tweets were still online 3 hours after being posted.</p>
<p>So, why did the hackers pick Ross' Restaurant in Iowa? </p>
<p>Ross' Restaurant was just featured on The Rachel Maddow Show after Obama made a stop at the restaurant to fulfill a campaign promise he had made 3 years earlier.</p>
<p>Here is the story from Obama Foodoroma about Ross' Restaurant:</p>

<p>Tues. June 28:<br>
<a href="http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2011/06/keeping-2008-campaign-promise-in-iowa.html">Keeping a 2008 Campaign Promise in Iowa, President Obama Gets Lunch in Ross' Restaurant</a><br>
Sat. July 2:<br>
<a href="http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2011/07/presidents-magic-mountain-lunch-at-ross.html">President's "Magic Mountain" Lunch at Ross' Restaurant featured on Rachel Maddow Show</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The President during his Tuesday visit to the 24-hour eatery had ordered four Magic Mountains--grilled Texas toast topped with loose steamed hamburger meat, piled high with a choice of French fries or hash browns, homemade cheddar cheese sauce, as well as two Volcanoes, which is the Magic Mountain with the addition of a scoop of 5-alarm meat chili and onions on top. "</p></blockquote>
<p>The Rachel Maddow Show clip features restaurant owner Cynthia Ross-Freidhof and her daughter Melissa Freidhof-Rogers making a "Magic Mountain" and a "Volcano" on air. According to Obama Foodorama: "It was the first time food has ever been featured on the political commentary program."</p>
<p>Melissa, conscious of the <a href="http://www.letsmove.gov/">Let's Move</a> campaign asked Obama Foodorama to issue an apology to The First Lady for publicizing food that does not fit in with her campaign. She was relieved to hear that Michelle Obama <a href="http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2011/06/michelle-obama-our-lady-of-french-fries.html">loves French Fries</a> and believes in moderation which could include an  occasional "Magic Mountain." </p>

<p></p>
<p>So, perhaps the hackers choice of Ross' Restaurant in Iowa was simply a matter of timing  -- a familiar name due to recent media publicity. But clearly if you follow the news at all Obama had been there days earlier and left the restaurant alive and well. Using Ross' in such a negative way is an unfortunate blow to the owners who were riding high on such positive and unexpected attention. I just wonder why the hackers targeted them as well as Fox News?</p>

When you are ready to make payment, place your credit card, cash, cowrie shells, or whatever method of payment is accepted inside the bill folder with just enough spilling out to indicate that you are ready to make payment. This is important. It is most likely (and hoped for) that your server will not be staring at you as you rifle through your wallet. When you have accomplished this feat, place the bill folder at the edge of the table next to you or, if you are seated in a booth, the end of the table nearest the server's approach.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I find it surprising how many people  do not understand this small-but-important ritual. The folder could be stuffed with cash, but if it looks as though it has been both untouched and unmoved, it's not going anywhere. Servers are often expected to read the minds of guests, but I think they deserve a little help on this one. Please, make it obvious that you are ready to give payment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>3. When the server hands you back your bill, sign it at your leisure, but when you are finished, please place it back on the edge of the table. Your server may then take it away. He (in most cases) is not taking it away out of greed, but rather to take care of the paperwork, especially if you have paid by credit card. Your bill must be closed with the proper paperwork. \u003cstrong>Read: the restaurant's copy of the credit card receipt.\u003c/strong> If, in your wine-soaked joy of the evening, you have accidentally pocketed the receipt (and we've all done it at least once, waiters included), the server might gently ask you for it as you leave.

As a waiter, this can be remarkably painful. I worry that I am embarrassing one of my guests-- especially one of my guests who happens to be leaving me a tip. Any server worth his salt will just treat it (outwardly) that it's no big deal and, rather than say, \"I'm sorry, your card's been declined,\" will say something to the effect of, \"Excuse me, do you have another card? This one doesn't seem to be working.\" Unless I'm handed one of those black titanium American Express cards. Then I always give a little frown and tell them it's declined. The response is invariably one of, \"Uh huh.

There is a certain ritual to this that must be followed:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of your dining parters grabs the check and insists on paying. You then say, \"Oh, no, I just \u003cem>couldn't\u003c/em> let you do that.\" Then they counter with something like, \"But I'd really like to treat you to dinner tonight. Really, it would make me \u003cem>very\u003c/em> happy to do it!\" You are then supposed to respond with something to the effect of, \"Well... alright, if it will make you happy, but\u003cem> I'm\u003c/em> taking \u003cem>you\u003c/em> out next time.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then you're done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Do not, I repeat, \u003cstrong>do not\u003c/strong> drag the server into this. At my tables, I have in most cases been spending the previous two hours making sure that everyone in my charge is as comfortable and happy as possible. I am not there to referee. Taking sides is not in my economic interest. If I am approached privately by a member of a dining party who hands me his or her card and insists on paying, I will: a) run the credit card and hand back at the end of the meal, run and ready so that he or she is one step ahead of arguments, or b) if the card-giver is not the clear-cut host, I will hand the card back uncharged. To the host.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In extreme cases, when different people start shoving cards or check presenters in my face (it happens) saying everything but \"Pick me!

Really, it would make me \u003cem>very\u003c/em> happy to do it!\" You are then supposed to respond with something to the effect of, \"Well... alright, if it will make you happy, but\u003cem> I'm\u003c/em> taking \u003cem>you\u003c/em> out next time.\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then you're done.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Do not, I repeat, \u003cstrong>do not\u003c/strong> drag the server into this. At my tables, I have in most cases been spending the previous two hours making sure that everyone in my charge is as comfortable and happy as possible. I am not there to referee. Taking sides is not in my economic interest. If I am approached privately by a member of a dining party who hands me his or her card and insists on paying, I will: a) run the credit card and hand back at the end of the meal, run and ready so that he or she is one step ahead of arguments, or b) if the card-giver is not the clear-cut host, I will hand the card back uncharged. To the host.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In extreme cases, when different people start shoving cards or check presenters in my face (it happens) saying everything but \"Pick me! Pick me!\" I am polite, but firm. And mildly, chidingly sarcastic. I tell the contenders something akin to, \"Oh, you're all just so \u003cem>wonderful\u003c/em> to want to pay for dinner, I wish I could pick \u003cem>all\u003c/em> of you!\" I then take a step back  from the table, saying, \"I can't \u003cem>wait\u003c/em> to see who wins!\"\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}},{"type":"component","content":"","name":"ad","attributes":{"named":{"label":"floatright"},"numeric":["floatright"]}},{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then I walk away.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/bayareabites/3920/check-please-how-to-pay-without-looking-like-a-fool-or-making-everyone-uncomfortable","authors":["5017"],"categories":["bayareabites_752","bayareabites_1146"],"tags":["bayareabites_666","bayareabites_2193","bayareabites_92"],"featImg":"bayareabites_3921","label":"bayareabites"},"food_1337525":{"type":"posts","id":"food_1337525","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"food","id":"1337525","found":true},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"chinatowns-li-po-lounge-is-a-portal-into-the-past","title":"Chinatown's Li Po Lounge is a Portal Into the Past","publishDate":1716232409,"format":"video","headTitle":"Chinatown&#8217;s Li Po Lounge is a Portal Into the Past | KQED","labelTerm":{},"content":"\u003cp>Walking through San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown, you may be surprised to stumble across a literal cave in the middle of Grant Street.

That&rsquo;s not necessarily a problem; soy tofu can be quite delicious, \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2017/06/03/diy-tofu-making-homemade-tofu-is-easier-than-you-think/\">especially when you&rsquo;re making it yourself\u003c/a>. But there are other tofus out there in the universe: Shan tofu, a Burmese preparation, made from chickpea flour; \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2012/01/31/hemp-tofu/\">hemp tofu\u003c/a>, which Vi Zahajszky made for this food blog back in 2012; peanut tofu, made in a similar manner to soy tofu; and a world of other tofu-like concoctions made from any bean you can think of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cooks have different reasons for making tofu from beans other than soy. Some are concerned about GMOs, others have soy allergies, while still others just like the flavor of a different type of bean. Personally, I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;I want to explore new flavors&rdquo; camp.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In this exploration, I&rsquo;ve learned that you can&rsquo;t just pull another dried bean out of your pantry and follow soy tofu directions. Soybeans are actually quite unique, and it is their particular protein and fat proportions that allow their milk to be curdled and separated just like cheese. According to some internet sources, peanuts behave similarly to soybeans and, with the help of a couple of extra ingredients, can be treated the same way. (Unfortunately for all of you reading this, I am allergic to peanuts, so I&rsquo;ll leave you to experiment with them and report back in the comments.) Other beans need an almost entirely different approach.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The most common recipe for soy-free tofu is chickpea flour-based Shan tofu. Chickpea flour is simply finely ground dried chickpeas, and, thanks to its use in gluten-free baking, it is now fairly easy to find in grocery stores. However, I set out to make this recipe adaptable for any dried bean in your pantry and it is not very easy to find flours made from cannellini or pinto beans. (I&rsquo;m also assuming that most of you do not own a grain mill with which you could grind your own dried beans into flour.) Instead, I decided to harness the power of starch, along with my bean milks of choice, to make my soy-free tofu.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yes, before the definition police come calling, I do know that, traditionally, &ldquo;tofu&rdquo; is only made from bean curd. However, there already exists a range of tofu-like products made with other ingredients that are referred to as tofus, so I will do the same. You can make up your own new name if you&rsquo;d prefer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_118121\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 1920px\">\u003cimg src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_.jpg\" alt=\"First, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight.\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1330\" class=\"size-full wp-image-118121\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_.jpg 1920w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-160x111.jpg 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-800x554.jpg 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-768x532.jpg 768w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-1020x707.jpg 1020w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-1180x817.jpg 1180w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-960x665.jpg 960w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-240x166.jpg 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-375x260.jpg 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-520x360.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">First, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight. \u003ccite>(Kate Williams)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>To get started, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight.

Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook the milk for 15 minutes. This cooking process will take away any raw bean flavor and will make the final tofu digestible and delicious. Depending on your bean of choice, you will notice that the milk will have started to thicken by this point. Chickpeas, for example, have quite a bit of starch in them, and their milk will turn to a thick custard on its own. In fact, some recipes say that you can cook chickpea milk to a tofu-like thickness all on its own; unfortunately, I did not have any success with this method.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To get the milk from custard to sliceable tofu, you will need to add more starch. I like to use cornstarch since it is cheap and always on hand in my house.

Keep stirring until the mixture becomes super thick and pulls away from the sides of the pot. If the milk doesn&rsquo;t thicken up within a minute, sift more cornstarch into the milk, a tablespoon at a time, until it does. You&rsquo;ll know it when you see it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Finally, transfer the thickened tofu mixture to a loaf pan and let it cool. The tofu will continue to thicken and set as it reaches room temperature. Once it is cooled, you can flip it out onto a cutting board and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Depending on the bean you&rsquo;ve used, the tofu will have a slightly different texture. Cannellini tofu is more jelly-like than chickpea tofu, for example, and they&rsquo;ll all be less firm than traditional soy tofu. If you&rsquo;d like to cook them, I&rsquo;d highly recommend using a non-stick skillet and a gentle hand. Or, do as I&rsquo;ve been doing, and pop a few cubes into your mouth straight from the fridge as a protein-packed afternoon snack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_118118\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 1920px\">\u003cimg src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade cannellini and chickpea tofus.\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" class=\"size-full wp-image-118118\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW.jpg 1920w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-160x107.jpg 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-800x533.jpg 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-1180x787.jpg 1180w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-960x640.jpg 960w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-240x160.jpg 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-375x250.jpg 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/both-tofus-6-NEW-520x347.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Homemade cannellini and chickpea tofus. \u003ccite>(Kate Williams)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Recipe: Homemade Soy-Free Tofu\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Makes about 1 pound\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Note:\u003c/strong> Unlike traditional soy tofu, which is made by separating soy milk into curds and whey, &ldquo;alterna-tofus&rdquo; are set by cooking down their milk and an additional starch.

Ladle out about a cup of the milk out into a large bowl. Sift the cornstarch over the milk in the bowl and whisk it in until smooth. Pour the cornstarch-milk mixture into the pot with the remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the bean mixture turns extremely thick and pulls away from the sides of the pot, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If the mixture does not thicken up, sift in additional cornstarch, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>Transfer the tofu mixture to a loaf pan measuring about 9 by 5 inches (smaller loaf pans will work as well; your tofu will be thicker) and smooth the top as best you can.

That&rsquo;s not necessarily a problem; soy tofu can be quite delicious, \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2017/06/03/diy-tofu-making-homemade-tofu-is-easier-than-you-think/\">especially when you&rsquo;re making it yourself\u003c/a>. But there are other tofus out there in the universe: Shan tofu, a Burmese preparation, made from chickpea flour; \u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2012/01/31/hemp-tofu/\">hemp tofu\u003c/a>, which Vi Zahajszky made for this food blog back in 2012; peanut tofu, made in a similar manner to soy tofu; and a world of other tofu-like concoctions made from any bean you can think of.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cooks have different reasons for making tofu from beans other than soy. Some are concerned about GMOs, others have soy allergies, while still others just like the flavor of a different type of bean. Personally, I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;I want to explore new flavors&rdquo; camp.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In this exploration, I&rsquo;ve learned that you can&rsquo;t just pull another dried bean out of your pantry and follow soy tofu directions. Soybeans are actually quite unique, and it is their particular protein and fat proportions that allow their milk to be curdled and separated just like cheese. According to some internet sources, peanuts behave similarly to soybeans and, with the help of a couple of extra ingredients, can be treated the same way. (Unfortunately for all of you reading this, I am allergic to peanuts, so I&rsquo;ll leave you to experiment with them and report back in the comments.) Other beans need an almost entirely different approach.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The most common recipe for soy-free tofu is chickpea flour-based Shan tofu. Chickpea flour is simply finely ground dried chickpeas, and, thanks to its use in gluten-free baking, it is now fairly easy to find in grocery stores. However, I set out to make this recipe adaptable for any dried bean in your pantry and it is not very easy to find flours made from cannellini or pinto beans. (I&rsquo;m also assuming that most of you do not own a grain mill with which you could grind your own dried beans into flour.) Instead, I decided to harness the power of starch, along with my bean milks of choice, to make my soy-free tofu.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yes, before the definition police come calling, I do know that, traditionally, &ldquo;tofu&rdquo; is only made from bean curd. However, there already exists a range of tofu-like products made with other ingredients that are referred to as tofus, so I will do the same. You can make up your own new name if you&rsquo;d prefer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_118121\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 1920px\">\u003cimg src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_.jpg\" alt=\"First, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight.\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1330\" class=\"size-full wp-image-118121\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_.jpg 1920w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-160x111.jpg 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-800x554.jpg 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-768x532.jpg 768w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-1020x707.jpg 1020w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-1180x817.jpg 1180w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-960x665.jpg 960w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-240x166.jpg 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-375x260.jpg 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/24/2017/06/soaked-white-beans_-520x360.jpg 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">First, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight. \u003ccite>(Kate Williams)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>To get started, soak your bean of choice in cool water overnight.

Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook the milk for 15 minutes. This cooking process will take away any raw bean flavor and will make the final tofu digestible and delicious. Depending on your bean of choice, you will notice that the milk will have started to thicken by this point. Chickpeas, for example, have quite a bit of starch in them, and their milk will turn to a thick custard on its own. In fact, some recipes say that you can cook chickpea milk to a tofu-like thickness all on its own; unfortunately, I did not have any success with this method.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To get the milk from custard to sliceable tofu, you will need to add more starch. I like to use cornstarch since it is cheap and always on hand in my house. If you prefer not to use cornstarch, other recipes call for tapioca, potato starch or (you may have guessed it) additional chickpea flour.

Keep stirring until the mixture becomes super thick and pulls away from the sides of the pot.

The tofu will continue to thicken and set as it reaches room temperature. Once it is cooled, you can flip it out onto a cutting board and cut it into bite-sized pieces. Depending on the bean you&rsquo;ve used, the tofu will have a slightly different texture. Cannellini tofu is more jelly-like than chickpea tofu, for example, and they&rsquo;ll all be less firm than traditional soy tofu. If you&rsquo;d like to cook them, I&rsquo;d highly recommend using a non-stick skillet and a gentle hand.
