Then, he said he wanted to delay it because of its potential to exacerbate the severe&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/tag/budget/\">state budget\u003c/a>&nbsp;shortfall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But two weeks before the deadline for employers to start paying more to their employees, many health workers are still waiting to hear whether they will in fact see a raise.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some health workers remain hopeful. Others have already been notified by their employers of their upcoming raise or have already started to see increased pay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When Newsom presented his latest budget proposal last week, the governor said negotiations around potential changes to the&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/health/2023/10/california-minimum-wage-health-care-law/\">health worker minimum wage\u003c/a>&nbsp;law,&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB525\">Senate Bill 525\u003c/a>, are still taking place. He promised a deal between his administration, the Legislature and proponents of the law would be hashed out in the upcoming weeks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;This budget will not be signed without that deal that we committed to being addressed,&rdquo; Newsom said. He usually signs a budget for the next fiscal year in late June.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Meanwhile the union that advocated for the health care pay increase has launched an advertising campaign that aims to hold Newsom to the law he signed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One ad by Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West on the&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://x.com/seiu_uhw/status/1786116278509527235?s=43\">social media site X&nbsp;\u003c/a>shows a dialysis worker named Alice and it reads, &ldquo;The dialysis care Alice provides is lifesaving.

What we saw in conversations earlier this year was folks really focusing only on money and only on dollars and cents, and not on what those dollars and cents are used for.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SEIU-UHW is an affiliate of SEIU California, which sponsored the law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We made a decision that we&rsquo;ve got to make sure we&rsquo;re reminding people why this was made into law to begin with,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Selzer said he is not directly involved in conversations with the governor&rsquo;s office and legislators, but that confusion among many workers rings true. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard June 1, we&rsquo;ve heard July 1. It remains to be seen what actually happens here,&rdquo; he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Deadline to postpone minimum wage hike\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>What exactly is holding up the negotiations is unclear. Lawmakers and Newsom would have to pass and sign legislation that would push back the start date within two weeks to delay it effectively.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Newsom said he wanted to postpone the wage increase when he released his initial budget proposal in January. He asked the Legislature for an annual &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; that would tie the minimum wage increases to the state&rsquo;s budget outlook. His administration projects the state is facing a&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/05/california-budget-deficit-newsom-may-proposal/\">$27.6 billion deficit\u003c/a> in 2024&ndash;25.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The state has estimated the minimum wage increase could cost the state around $4 billion a year. That&rsquo;s because the state would have to pay for the wage increases for its own employees at state health facilities and because the state may be forced to increase what it reimburses facilities for services provided to patients on Medi-Cal, its insurance program for low-income people, as a way to partially cover the pay raises.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The UC Berkeley Labor Center estimates the cost to the state to be much lower. Total health spending in California would increase by about $2.7 billion because of the law, but the state would be responsible only for a fraction of that, according to the Labor Center&rsquo;s analysis.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Laurel Lucia, director of the Health Care Program at the Labor Center, said that there is no requirement in the law that directs the state to raise&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/tag/medi-cal/\">Medi-Cal payments\u003c/a>&nbsp;to hospitals and clinics as a way to make up for the costs of higher wages, but the law could play a role in Medi-Cal rate negotiations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;When the rates were set for 2024, there was recognition in&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/Documents/DirectedPymts/CA-CY-2024-Rate-Certification-Report.pdf\">the (rates) report (PDF)\u003c/a>&nbsp;that there might need to be changes to those rates due to&rdquo; the minimum wage increase, Lucia said.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>California hospitals, dialysis clinics raising pay\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Absent any confirmed changes to the law, some employers and associations representing health employers say they are moving forward with the raises as scheduled.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;As far as we know, the minimum wage for health care workers will be going up as of June 1.

Despite working nearly full-time, he was barely able to make ends meet. So, when the pandemic hit, Varilla-Aguilar continued working. He got critically sick in December 2020.

Then, in March 2021, Varilla-Aguilar woke up. &ldquo;When I opened my eyes, it felt like a few days [had passed],&rdquo; Varilla-Aguilar said. &ldquo;But they told me it had been three months &hellip; It was a shock.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_11986483\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 2000px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11986483\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg\" alt=\"A middle-aged Latino man puts on an oxygen mask at home.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1920x1280.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Osbaldo Varilla-Aguilar, 46, puts on the oxygen ventilator he uses every night in San Francisco on Feb. 26, 2024. \u003ccite>(Pablo Unzueta for El Tecolote/CatchLight Local)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Today, more than three years after he was discharged from the hospital, Varilla-Aguilar still depends on the oxygen respirator next to his bed.

Then, in March 2021, Varilla-Aguilar woke up. &ldquo;When I opened my eyes, it felt like a few days [had passed],&rdquo; Varilla-Aguilar said. &ldquo;But they told me it had been three months &hellip; It was a shock.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_11986483\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"max-width: 2000px\">\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11986483\" src=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg\" alt=\"A middle-aged Latino man puts on an oxygen mask at home.\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/FEBMAY2024-LONGCOVID-ET-PU-16-KQED-1920x1280.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Osbaldo Varilla-Aguilar, 46, puts on the oxygen ventilator he uses every night in San Francisco on Feb. 26, 2024. \u003ccite>(Pablo Unzueta for El Tecolote/CatchLight Local)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Today, more than three years after he was discharged from the hospital, Varilla-Aguilar still depends on the oxygen respirator next to his bed.
