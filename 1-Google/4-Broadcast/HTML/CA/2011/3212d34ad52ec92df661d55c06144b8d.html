It changes the climate. We know for example when trees were cut down in the Amazon, there was less precipitation.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the team&rsquo;s main discoveries was that large amounts of water in the Eel River watershed is stored in the massive network of fractures in the rock that can be tens to hundreds of feet thick. This &ldquo;rock water reservoir&rdquo; is hidden deep inside the Earth, away from the influence of evaporation. It sits beneath the soil and above the saturated layer commonly called ground water and occupies the deepest part of what hydrologists call the &ldquo;unsaturated zone&rdquo;. Many trees reach their deep roots into this matrix of water-filled rock fissures and use the water stored there when other water sources dry out or become unavailable. Different types of rock store water in different ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We are thinking of them as different types of sponges in the subsurface in the way they take up and retain moisture and give back that moisture to the vegetation that is rooted into them,&rdquo; says Dietrich.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In additional to discovering the amount of water stored in underground rock fractures, Dawson and his team have learned that different types of trees actually use the &ldquo;rock water&rdquo; in very different ways depending on climate conditions. For example, the rock matrix inside slopes of hills is a key water resource for the largest trees in the watershed, like Douglas firs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hardwood trees like tanoak, madrone and live oaks rely largely on precipitation. But when drier times come, they shift to using the more stable groundwater below the surface and then may draw on some \"rock water\" in later summer and fall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_94861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 900px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-94861\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/quest/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Dawson trapping water vapor in the Eel River CZO.\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto.jpg 900w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto-400x300.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Todd Dawson trapping water vapor in the Eel River CZO. \u003ccite>(Credit: Anthony Ambrose)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Conifers play a larger role in moving water out of the subsurface areas in winter and early spring, Dawson says.

It changes the climate. We know for example when trees were cut down in the Amazon, there was less precipitation.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the team&rsquo;s main discoveries was that large amounts of water in the Eel River watershed is stored in the massive network of fractures in the rock that can be tens to hundreds of feet thick. This &ldquo;rock water reservoir&rdquo; is hidden deep inside the Earth, away from the influence of evaporation. It sits beneath the soil and above the saturated layer commonly called ground water and occupies the deepest part of what hydrologists call the &ldquo;unsaturated zone&rdquo;. Many trees reach their deep roots into this matrix of water-filled rock fissures and use the water stored there when other water sources dry out or become unavailable. Different types of rock store water in different ways.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We are thinking of them as different types of sponges in the subsurface in the way they take up and retain moisture and give back that moisture to the vegetation that is rooted into them,&rdquo; says Dietrich.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In additional to discovering the amount of water stored in underground rock fractures, Dawson and his team have learned that different types of trees actually use the &ldquo;rock water&rdquo; in very different ways depending on climate conditions. For example, the rock matrix inside slopes of hills is a key water resource for the largest trees in the watershed, like Douglas firs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hardwood trees like tanoak, madrone and live oaks rely largely on precipitation. But when drier times come, they shift to using the more stable groundwater below the surface and then may draw on some \"rock water\" in later summer and fall.\u003c/p>\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_94861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 900px\">\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-94861\" src=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/quest/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Dawson trapping water vapor in the Eel River CZO.\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto.jpg 900w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto-400x300.jpg 400w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/39/2015/11/todd_dawson_trapping_vapor_900_675_80auto-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\">\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Todd Dawson trapping water vapor in the Eel River CZO. \u003ccite>(Credit: Anthony Ambrose)\u003c/cite>\u003c/figcaption>\u003c/figure>\n\u003cp>Conifers play a larger role in moving water out of the subsurface areas in winter and early spring, Dawson says.
