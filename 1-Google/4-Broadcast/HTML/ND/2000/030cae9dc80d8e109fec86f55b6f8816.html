I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read. I am extremely happy to have my first reporting job in Bismarck and having the honor and privilege of telling your stories. If you see me out in the community, please do not hesitate to stop and say hello. \n\nConnect with Me!\n\nEmail: Justin.Gick@kfyrtv.com\nTwitter/Instagram: @JGickTV\nFacebook: Justin Gick TV","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kfyr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-02-14T16:01:00.306Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:08:03.182Z","description":{"basic":"On Thursday, a New York jury convicted former President Donald Trump of 34 counts of falsifying business records.

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read.

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read. I am extremely happy to have my first reporting job in Bismarck and having the honor and privilege of telling your stories. If you see me out in the community, please do not hesitate to stop and say hello. \n\nConnect with Me!\n\nEmail: Justin.Gick@kfyrtv.com\nTwitter/Instagram: @JGickTV\nFacebook: Justin Gick TV","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kfyr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-02-14T16:01:00.306Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:38:37.227Z","description":{"basic":"Political analyst Rick Clayburgh said polling is really an interesting science.

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read. I am extremely happy to have my first reporting job in Bismarck and having the honor and privilege of telling your stories. If you see me out in the community, please do not hesitate to stop and say hello. \n\nConnect with Me!\n\nEmail: Justin.Gick@kfyrtv.com\nTwitter/Instagram: @JGickTV\nFacebook: Justin Gick

I’m from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is about a half hour outside of Philadelphia. \n\nI attended La Salle University in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated with my B.A. in Communication and Political Science in May of 2021. \n\nPrior to joining the KFYR news team, I was a Special Police Officer and Police Dispatcher for the Cherry Hill Police Department in New Jersey. It was an honor to serve and give back to the community I grew up in. I started out as an intern for their Community Response Unit during my junior year of college, where I helped with social media and created videos of events they were sponsoring. After serving in the department for almost four years, I made the decision to come back to journalism and do what I have always wanted to do.\n\nDuring my college years I was active in my campus TV station. I was a reporter/producer/anchor for La Salle TV News. I reported from the White House, the Vice President’s plane Air Force Two, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and many other places. La Salle TV really helped me prepare for a career in television news. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London during my junior year of college. I did reports on major stories going on in London and sent them back to my campus station to air on our newscasts. I also had the opportunity to intern at ABC News while there and got to do some amazing things with bureau staff and the foreign correspondents. My time was cut short there due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It was very interesting traveling home to the United States at the time.\n\nI was also very involved in my school newspapers during elementary, middle, and high school. I got interested in news when I was 3 years old. My parents remember when they took me to the Jersey Shore and I got up on a table with my mom’s hairbrush and started reporting on the conditions there. It transpired after that, that any time a news van was in our area I would have my parents drive me over so that I could meet the reporter and observe how they put stories together. The reporters I met have become mentors and close friends. I wouldn’t be here today if not for them helping and believing in me. \n\nWhen I’m not reporting, I like to work out, run, explore new places, spend time with family and friends, and read. I am extremely happy to have my first reporting job in Bismarck and having the honor and privilege of telling your stories. If you see me out in the community, please do not hesitate to stop and say hello. \n\nConnect with Me!\n\nEmail: Justin.Gick@kfyrtv.com\nTwitter/Instagram: @JGickTV\nFacebook: Justin Gick TV","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kfyr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-02-14T16:01:00.306Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T18:42:50.656Z","description":{"basic":"Former President Donald Trump endorsed Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak in her bid for North Dakota’s sole congressional seat."},"headlines":{"basic":"Trump endorses Fedorchak for US House","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/ILVwXKUxPXXUH95J3gusxPSWIwY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Fedorchak anounces her bid for U.S. House seat.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU.jpg","owner":"mikaela.thom@kfyrtv.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/ILVwXKUxPXXUH95J3gusxPSWIwY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/ILVwXKUxPXXUH95J3gusxPSWIwY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/ekHnOmzlgtj3icrI6aEtbtjbDpM=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CB3WRLGLONF2LPWAMGMZTHZTXU.jpg","usage_instructions":"None","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"540cf8f2e0d411b7ced15a5ef221c9bd3751e70aa36ddafe176f9bdf35394c0e"},"caption":"File -

I'm looking forward to \"finding my pitch\" in the television business at KMOT-TV in the Magic City. \n\nI come to Minot all the way from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  I'll admit I was a little sad to leave the Badger State, but I've already met some great people here in the Peace Garden State….and I think I'm prepared for the snow. \n\nI graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 with a degree from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as a double-major in English. \n\nDuring college I had the opportunity to report on Wisconsin Badgers sports as an intern for SportsRadio 1250 WSSP, based out of Milwaukee.  I also interned at Madison Area Technical College, where I interviewed students and wrote bios for the school's alumni website.  And throughout college I wrote for almost every page of one of our student newspapers, The Daily Cardinal.  You name it, I covered it—from rallies at the Capitol in Madison, to a deployment of Wisconsin troops to Iraq, to UW softball, to local theater, to famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson visiting my dorm. \n\nAfter graduation I interned at Today's TMJ4, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee, where I learned from some of the best on how to create compelling stories.  While at TMJ4 I also interned at Time Warner Cable Sports 32 in Milwaukee, assisting in production of their sports talk shows. \n\nI was an avid choral singer in college, and while interning in Milwaukee, I joined the Bel Canto Chorus, one of the oldest community choirs in Wisconsin.  The group was honored to have our Christmas concerts broadcast on Wisconsin Public Television. \n\nIf you have any story ideas, or questions, email:

I love to talk about sports, especially football! I used to be a news anchor and reporter for the local radio station but now I’m excited for a new adventure in television!\n\nI was born in Dickinson but moved to Williston in 2006, right before the start of the oil boom. I’ve always had a calling for the media. When I was younger I used to watch the news every night with my grandparents. Being a meteorologist was one of my dream jobs back then.\n\nIt was in High School where I realized I wanted to be in the news. I participated in speech, which taught me about building newscasts and my delivery. It was alot of fun and for me, it felt right.\n\nAfter graduating in 2014, I took a year-long online course at the American Broadcasting School, a technical school where I got my degree in broadcasting. I’ve spent 3 years covering news and local sports and now I can’t wait to do what I love for KUMV-TV weekdays at 6 and

intrigued and passionate about the weather for as long as I can remember. Big snowstorms have always excited me since I'm an avid skier, so I wanted to know when the mountains of New England were going to have the best ski conditions. One snowstorm that I'll always remember is the October 2011 Nor'easter that caused Halloween to be canceled in my hometown since over a foot of snow fell and many people were without power. \n\nI also remember setting up a weather station outside my house growing up and being excited when any thunderstorms came through our town. One severe storm that really showed me how powerful Mother Nature could be was a macroburst with over 100 mph winds that hit my hometown in 2018 taking down hundreds of trees and damaging many homes.\n\nI am a proud Penn Stater and graduated in May of 2021 with a bachelor's degree in meteorology and atmospheric science with a concentration in weather forecasting and communications. During my time at Penn State, I was involved in many TV broadcasts both on the air and behind the scenes including \"The Centre County Report,\" \"Weather or Not,\" and \"Weather World.\" I also served as the Head of Communications for the Campus Weather Service, the nation’s oldest and largest student-run weather forecasting organization. During the summer of 2019, I had an internship at NBC Connecticut (WVIT) where I really got to see what it's like to be a broadcast meteorologist. I am also a NOAA Hollings Scholar, and through this program, I got to complete a research project with the National Weather Service in Bismarck investigating the best ways to communicate winter weather events using graphics. \n\nI am excited to be living in the beautiful Northern Plains and forecasting our ever-changing weather! Watch me Saturdays at 6pm and 10pm CT and Sundays at 5pm and 10pm CT on Your News Leader.\n\nWhen I'm not forecasting the weather, I love spending time outdoors by going on a hike, biking, golfing, and skiing. I also enjoy bowling and I try to volunteer in my local community whenever I can. I am also a sports fanatic and a lifelong New York Mets fan. I also root for the New York Jets and Islanders, and I'll be forever loyal to my Nittany Lions.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions by reaching out to me by email: jacob.morse@kfyrtv.com.
