This week, I finally got to report some positive news for Missourians. General Motors is bringing 1800 jobs to the St. Louis area after closing
down it's plant in Shreveport, Louisiana.

Thursday&nbsp;it will expand its&nbsp;Wentzville plant doubling the plant's
employment&nbsp;over the next three years. The plant will add a second
shift of workers and begin building&nbsp;GM's Colorado midsize pickup.</p>

believes the expansion will not only create jobs but will have a
major&nbsp;effect&nbsp;on the community. 
</p>
<style>
</style>
"This could have a billion dollar impact over the next three years in the
region. That&#x2019;s why its such big news. It's not specifically those assembly line
jobs, it&#x2019;s what they create," said Lambi.&nbsp;

<p margin-bottom:12.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:="" none;text-autospace:none="">On Thursday, MDN received a press release from the
Health Department regarding an E. coli outbreak in St. Louis. While the press
release was vague, a newspaper reporter published an article stating that the
outbreak was a major epidemic. Our newsroom jumped on the story right away. </p>
<p margin-bottom:12.0pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:="" none;text-autospace:none="">I spearheaded the sequence of stories, getting in
touch with head doctors and microbiologists from one of the hospitals treating
patients. While interviewing one of head doctors, I referenced a figure
regarding the number of cases from the article. While referencing this figure,
he was completely taken aback. The numbers were not factually correct.

On Thursday, The Missouri House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution to continue the funding of Boeing's F-18 fighter jet program. But just last week, the House majority voted to support Boeing's Texas-based competitor. The resolution supported the funding of building F-35 fighter jets which is made by Lockheed Martin. These Texas-built F-35 fighter jets would replace St. Louis F-18 manufacturing.<br><p>
</p>Reminder: Boeing is the second largest employer in Missouri employing 15,000 workers just in the St. Louis area <b>and</b> generates&nbsp;one 
billion dollars&nbsp;for the state each year.&nbsp; 
<p>So when covering this story on Thursday, I asked a number of representatives how the first resolution even reached the House floor. A simple answer: No one really read the resolution. That's right: No one read the resolution. The House majority leader admitted he merely skimmed the resolution before giving his support...Financial support to a competitor of a major employer in Missouri where jobs are constantly being cut and failing to be created (Mamtek and China Hub serve as timely examples).&nbsp;
</p><p> As the special session stretches on, I am continuously amazed by some of the little research - and reading - that actually takes place within the state Capitol. <br></p><p>

<p>Since I started working at MDN, I have been fortunate to
work on stories in which all of my facts and figures have been presented
relatively clearly and my interview sources have been, more or less, easily
reached. I have also solely worked on day-turn stories. For the first time on
Thursday, I hit a significant roadblock researching for a major story I am
pursuing. The story significantly affects the city of St. Louis and St. Louis
taxpayers, so I began delving into, what I thought, was the issue. After making
the first two or three phone calls and speaking only with PR representatives, I did
not receive any substantive or legitimate answers. However, many more and significant angles began to
present themselves from the little information I obtained. My, then, &#x201C;focus&#x201D;
expanded, adding confusing angles that I had not considered. My story grew to be a lot more complex than I had originally perceived. Since no major
players would call me back, I could not determine hard facts from company
website or PR &#x201C;facts.&#x201D; I am going to need to obtain bank
statements and other legal records in order to do so. This week, I am going to continue to pursue this story
this week and narrow my focus. I am hoping to obtain these records and talk to
any credible leads.&nbsp;</p>

Amidst reading article after article on continuous job cuts throughout the country and in the state of Missouri, I was amazed on Thursday by how long it took before I had the chance to speak with an authority figure at the Department of Transportation. On Thursday, I covered MoDOT's five-year-plan update for the month of September. I called a number of different MoDOT officials to simply obtain numbers and to confirm facts.&nbsp; Eventually, I got in contact with a former commission member and finally the commission chair; however, I first had to spend four hours speaking with flack....after flack.... after flack. (Phill refers to public relations/communications representatives as 'flacks'). This is certainly not exclusive to MoDOT who recently cut nearly 700 jobs across the state and plans to cut 500 more by March 2013. I just have a very hard time believing that agencies who are being "forced" to cut and consolidate their work force do not have the funds to employ a large number of their workers, yet they have the funds to run their press department. <br><p>

</p>At MDN, we reporters work together as a team. This is becoming more and more evident each week as stories develop with more complex and surprising facets and details. <br><p>This proved especially true on Thursday.&nbsp; Gov. Nixon released a statement Wednesday to produce a jobs bill or shut down the special session. Alex and I interviewed a number of legislators to get their opinion on the governor's statement and the progress of the session. As soon as we thought we were finished with our story at 2:15, we discovered a newspaper reporter published an article just fifteen minutes earlier with new details of a visa program potentially funding the China hub program in St. Louis. Our story was now out-of-date and irrelevant. 
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Alex and I tossed our story and teamed up with Matt and Becky to try to find out more information about this new and unexpected program. At the end of the day after calling over a dozen legislators, we were unable to get in contact with the main players in the story. However, we fulfilled our duty by getting the news and information that we had acquired.

 two unaccredited St. Louis school districts in the state of Missouri. 
So after the first of the year, two of the largest metropolitan areas 
and economic centers in the state will provide
 children with an unaccredited education. </p>
<p>As a Kansas City 
native, I can recall watching numerous stories regarding the hiring, 
resigning and/or firing of superintendents and following the coverage of
 the constant, local school board drama in town.
 Since 2000, the school district has yo-yoed from receiving an 
unaccredited status to improving their standards and receiving a 
provisionally accredited status in 2006.
</p>
<p>However, this 
improvement did not last long. To date, the school district has failed 
to meet state progress and assessment standards. In 2008, the district 
constructed the &#x201C;Missouri School Improvement Program
 Accountability Turnaround Plan&#x201D; outlining goals to improve student 
achievement. This plan aimed to have the district reach full 
accreditation in 2010. However, that did not happen. Personally, I&#x2019;m 
confused where the &#x201C;accountability&#x201D; lies when Kansas City 
superintendents
 change 1.5 years on average. Accountability, in my eyes, normally runs 
concurrent with consistency.
</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s also not 
forget that in March 2010, the nation reported and watched Kansas City 
shut down 29 of its 61 public schools to avoid bankruptcy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So to say the least, I was very interested in covering and hearing the ruling on Tuesday.
</p>
<p>I am not happy, by 
any means, that my hometown school district lost its accreditation. However, I
 am hoping that it will motivate the state and the school board to 
collaborate and work together to get the schools
 meet state standards by 2014. </p>
<p>Currently, Ashley 
Massow, my fellow MDN education and higher education beat reporter, are 
working on an enterprise story to see how this ruling affects the 2012 
high school graduates pursuing college. On Thursday,
 I called over 20 Missouri universities and colleges hoping to receive 
some answers. In addition, I talked with a representative from the 
Kansas City school district.
</p><p>I am going to continue to follow this story and see what answers I can find.<br></p>

<p>While I was taught that it is a journalist's duty
to serve as a watchdog and protect the public, this week at the Capitol I got my own, real
taste of this and began to fully understand the value of teamwork in the newsroom.
</p><p>On Thursday, I
believed I was going to cover an early and relatively routine senate committee
hearing. While the Capitol has proven itself unpredictable, I was definitely not
expecting the dramatic day that ensued. </p>
<p>While covering the meeting regarding Missouri&#x2019;s future
plans to develop a health insurance exchange, as dictated by the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act or simply known as &#x201C;Obamacare,&#x201D; a senator received a notice that the
governor&#x2019;s staff and a high-risk pool were having a hearing of their own across
town.&nbsp; According to senator speculation, the governor&#x2019;s staff and the
pool were going to implement their own plan by executive order
bypassing legislature&#x2019;s input and approval. This comes as the state recently
received a $21 million dollar federal grant to create an exchange.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The meeting halted and three senators rushed to try to stop
the vote. I got a hold of my fellow MDN reporters who dropped everything and
quickly rushed to the scene across town. Every reporter of the newsroom became instantly
dedicated to this story. Whether at the Capitol, across town or on the phone,
we all buckled down and got to the bottom of the hushed and frankly sketchy
series of events. In journalism, as one of my former professor&#x2019;s told me, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
not about you.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s about doing everything possible to get the truth and inform the public. <br></p>

</p><p>I learned this week that when covering a hearing or meeting, your biggest story can present itself within the first five minutes, the last five minutes or over fifty-five minutes after the event's conclusion.
</p>This week kicked off the special session. On Tuesday, I volunteered to cover the House of Representatives technical session. While I perceived it would be long and daunting task,&nbsp; I barely had enough time to set up my Marantz before the hearing was adjourned. The hearing lasted less than five minutes and only 30 of the 163 representatives were present. So, I decided to pack up my belongings and interview two of the present representatives sponsoring bills throughout the session. When my partner Ashley and I finished our stories - or so we thought, Ashley double checked our facts and records with the clerk's office. To our surprise, a representative had filed two more bills - not scheduled on the governor's formal call - right before the close of the day. Within five seconds, our bland, overview stories of the special session were pushed aside. We were about to walk out the door when our biggest story arrived. We grabbed a Marantz and raced to the representative's office - who not surprisingly was gone for the day.&nbsp; Luckily when I called him on his cell phone, he agreed to an interview. It took us some time to write our wraps, but we had an obligation to break the story.&nbsp; This unexpected event made it clear to me to "never assume the day is done."

</p><p>On Thursday, I covered a committee hearing to discuss solutions for Missouri Medicaid recipients, following the state's termination of SynCare. While the hearing was scheduled to last less than three hours, it ended up running nearly four and a half hours due to all of the testimonies from health department officials and witnesses. My story presented itself within the first five minutes of the hearing when the health department director stated that, although the state ended its contract with the third party assessor a week ago, she still did not know how many recipients were being affected! It shocked me that an unknown number, potentially hundreds to thousands, of Medicaid recipients across the state were still waiting for their services. Although I stayed for the entirety of the hearing, I wrote my wraps on this shocking statement. <br></p><p>
