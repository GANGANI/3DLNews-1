<p>University of Missouri System President Gary Forsee sent an e-mail to students and faculty today asking for suggestion on how to meet a state projected 15 percent to 25 percent cut in appropriations due to an estimated $340 million state budget shortfall.</P>
<p>A cut of that size would range from $60 million to $100 million of the system's $400 million budget.</P>
<p>Forsee's e-mail&nbsp;also stated, "we need to do our part to help the state; however, our elected officials need to be aware of what our university means to the future success and well-being of Missourians."</P>
<p>The e-mail also states the University has until Dec. 18 to give a plan to the Missouri Department of Higher Education.</P>
<p><B><I>Posted December 9, 2008</I>:</B> <BR><BR>The Associated Press is reporting that a suspicious letter containing a powder substance was sent to Gov. Matt Blunt on Dec. 8, 2008.&nbsp; Similar letters were sent to governors in six other states.<BR>Activities at the Capitol went on as normal through out the day because the letter never reached the Capitol Building. The Associated Press reports that the letter addressed to Missouri's governor was identified at an offsite mail distribution center.<BR><BR>The other state's where letters containing the powdery substance were found include Montana, Michigan, Mississippi, Alabama and&nbsp; Rhode Island. No injuries had been reported as a result of the letters or the substance, which was not found to be harmful in every state but Missouri where information was not yet available as of 12:20 a.m. Tuesday.<BR><BR>The Associated Press story: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28120804/ </P>

<p>Gov. Elect Jay Nixon revealed his plan to confront an estimated $342 million state budget shortfall. Nixon said upon taking office he will direct each state department to create a plan to reduce expenditures. Nixon said he would also examine each current state construction project to ensure it is within budget and may order a review of all&nbsp;projects that have not yet been started.</P>
<p>The estimated deficit is a turnaround from a statement made in mid-July by the governor's office that suggested Missouri would&nbsp;end the&nbsp;fiscal year with $487 million remaining.</P>
<p>The governor's office spokeswoman Jessica Robinson declined to comment.</P>

<p>On Oct. 22 the Missouri Democratic Party issued a news release and video claiming that a staffer for Republican candidate for governor Rep. Kenny Hulshof's campaign roughed up a Democratic Party employee at an event during Hulshof's speech. The videographer is 'tracker' Vinay Vaz who like other trackers show up at an event for the opposing campaign and film any embarrassing incidents. Last year, a 'tracker' filmed Democrat governor candidate, Attorney General Jay Nixon, using his official vehicle to attend a campaign fund-raising event.</P>
<p>The video shows several campaign signs in the background as two men appear to have an argument and pace back and forth. It appears the man in the blue suit is keeping the videographer from moving forward. It's unclear if the man actually works for the Hulshof campaign but the Democratic Party is demanding an apology.</P>

<p>Noon- A big issue that comes up every time there is an election is education funding. This year the topic is even more important in terms of the national financial situation. Because of tax deficits in the late S Missouri cut higher education spending in 2003. The cuts were so large that state colleges and universities received less this year than in 2001. One statistic that many politicians like to quote in their stump speeches is that Missouri ranks Th in the nation for higher education appropriations. It turns out the number comes an Illinois State program called Grapevine. The group creates a compilation of data on state support for higher education. The data shows that for 2008, Missouri ranked Th in the nation for per capita higher education appropriation and is ranked above only New Hampshire, Colorado and Vermont.</P>

<p>The release also charged that "the Post-Dispatch is the preferred source for budget information for the liberal candidates who want to use their false assertions to television ads that are equally misleading."</P>

Kennedy made a surprise visit at the tribute in his honor at the Democratic National Convention Monday night.<BR><BR>In the first emotional high point of the convention Kennedy, who has stayed largely out of the public eye since undergoing brain surgery June 2, spoke with the passion known and expected from the Kennedy family. Although his voice occasional shook, the senator was reminiscent of the young man who took up the political reins after the death of his older brothers.<BR><BR>Colleagues and friends brushed aside implications that the speech was a farewell, a sentiment echoed by Kennedy who pledged to be back in the Senate to greet the new president in January.<BR><BR>If you missed Kennedy's speech <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fh80ZkVNk">check it out here</A>.<BR><BR>Michelle Obama used her keynote speech to mold her image to the American public. Speaking of her childhood on Chicago's south side and her role as a mother and sister, Obama portrayed herself as a product of the American dream.<BR><BR>Tuesday's schedule includes the keynote speech by Sen.
