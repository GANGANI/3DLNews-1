<p>While&nbsp;I was&nbsp;out on a walk with my editor today, he stumbled upon five trash bins of shredded emails were found in some proximity to Gov. Matt Blunt's office.&nbsp; </P>
<p>My colleague Laura and I&nbsp;combed through the trash and took video of the bins and the contents.&nbsp; Some of the documents were not shredded correctly&nbsp;and we could make out the contents, including names and emails addresses.</P>
<p>One woman approached us and told us she didn't think we were allowed to go through the trash.&nbsp; She said she was going to get a press secretary to speak with us.&nbsp; We waited for about 15 minutes and saw the woman walk past us a couple more times, but no one came out to talk to us and the woman never approached us again.</P>
<p>After we called Blunt's spokeswoman, Jessica Robinson, the five trash cans were taken away, and replaced with empty ones.&nbsp; As of 5:00 p.m. today, she hasn't called us back.</P>
<p>The governor's office may have simply been cleaning out its offices in lieu of Gov.-elect Nixon's impending transition.&nbsp; But with all the controversy surrounding how Blunt may or may not have withheld documents and emails, it's surprising to me that&nbsp;cans full of&nbsp;shredded documents were&nbsp;left out in the open.</P>
<p><B><I><B><I>Posted November 10, 2008</I>:</B>&nbsp;</I></B></P>
<p>Elections are <STRONG>finally</STRONG> over, and I couldn't be more relieved!&nbsp; While the politicians transition into their positions, I'm sure we'll be covering it and providing in-depth coverage about Missouri issues.</P>
<p>Right now I'm working on a story about provisional ballots, and about how the Secretary of State's office still hasn't announced which presidential candidate won Missouri's electoral votes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everyone considered Missouri to be a real battleground, one of the&nbsp;states that would decide&nbsp;a very close election.&nbsp; I was very surprised that McCain's concession speech came so early and that Missouri's votes have basically amounted to an afterthought.&nbsp; This campaign season,&nbsp;many cities&nbsp;of Missouri had campaign stops from Obama, McCain, Biden, and Palin.&nbsp; If we do&nbsp;lose our reputation as a bellwether, I wonder if&nbsp;campaigns will put in the same amount of effort to win Missouri in&nbsp;the future.&nbsp;</P>

<p><STRONG><EM>1:30 p.m.:</EM></STRONG> Someone dressed as GOP Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin has been going throughout the various offices at the Capitol today, attended by&nbsp;another woman dressed up as her PR secretary.&nbsp; Life in Jeff City can be pretty interesting sometimes.&nbsp; It is almost Election Day so maybe it was a publicity stunt.&nbsp; More likely that it was a Halloween costume, though. </P>
<p><B><I><B><I>Posted October 29, 2008</I>:</B>&nbsp;</I></B></P>
<p>After a long, long week of work and a week of editing, my profiles of Republican gubernatorial candidate Kenny Hulshof and Libertarian Andy Finkenstadt have finally made their way into the Columbia Missourian. I'm especially happy with my profile of Hulshof; I only had 15 minutes before a news conference to talk with him.</P>
<p>When you have a long interview, you can start asking more general questions and ask a lot of follow-ups, but I didn't really have the luxury of time, so I tried to get as pointed as I could with my questions beforehand. Surprisingly, Wikipedia gave me an interesting tidbit that really helped me focus: Hulshof played drums in an all Congressional band that had played for soldiers in the Middle East. We were told to write about these candidates as people, and what's more normal than popular music? </P>
<p>A quick youtube search provided me with this <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0Cs4kziENQ">video of the band</A>&nbsp;which was really interesting to watch. If you've ever wanted to see Hulshof singing backup to The Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There"<BR>&nbsp;here's your chance.</P>
<p>This knowledge about Hulshof was also very helpful with helping me relax my nerves. I'm pretty extroverted, but sometimes it's hard for me to make that first phone call in the morning or to talk to someone politically "important." Now, instead of being the candidate for governor, I was able to see him as someone who plays the same brand of drums as my eighteen-year-old brother. If there's one thing this job has taught me, it's that politicians are more normal than you think.</P>
<p><B><I>Posted October 18, 2008</I>:</B> Gubernatorial Debate blogging<BR><BR>5:33<BR>Oren Shur , spokesman for Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Attorney General Jay Nixon, said Nixon spent the day at the Obama rally, speaking along with Claire McCaskill before to heading to the debate.<BR><BR>5:55<BR>Still waiting for the debate to start.&nbsp; Ken Warren, Fox 2 analyst and professor at St. Louis University, said Nixonâ019s strategy is linking Republican candidate and Congressman Hulshof to Gov. Matt Blunt, President Bush, and the falling economy.<BR><BR>6:00<BR>Introductions of Nixon and Hulshof.<BR><BR>6:01<BR>"Missouri is at a crossroads," Nixon said.&nbsp; "I think the press has dubbed me Mr. New Idea."<BR><BR>Said this is not a time to place blame, but a time for politicians to show courage.<BR><BR>Hulshof also talked about how Nixon has been in Missouri government for too long to know how to change it.<BR><BR>6:04<BR>Nixon said he restored dignity to the attorney general's position.<BR><BR>Said he is running for Governor because Missouri needs change and that he will bring it.<BR><BR>Nixon said he would cut taxes and hold business accountable for sending jobs oversees.<BR><BR>"I'm proud of my record as Missouri's attorney general," he said.<BR><BR>6:07<BR>Hulshof said his plan MORE Jobs would help small businesses.&nbsp; If a rural small business added three jobs to it's payroll or urban small business added six jobs to its payroll, the business would receive a rebate.<BR><BR>Thinks he could have it instated by February.<BR><BR>6:09<BR>Nixon said Missouri needs to find a way to make sure college is affordable to create strong, trained workers.<BR><BR>6:10<BR>Hulshof said the MORE Jobs act will immediately put more money into the state economy.<BR><BR>6:11<BR>The panelists don't seem to know the rules of the debate.&nbsp; Does Nixon get a rebuttal?&nbsp; Apparently not.<BR><BR>Nixon said he wanted to balance the budget and run his office efficiently.<BR><BR>6:12<BR>Hulshof said the MORE jobs act would tap into the rainy day fund, but would invest in Missouri's businesses.&nbsp; "I will not raise taxes."<BR><BR>6:14<BR>Nixon: "We do balance our budget in Missouri.&nbsp; We do it every year."&nbsp; Nixon brings up Hulshof's involvement in pork projects.<BR><BR>6:15<BR>Hulshof said Nixon's record is to raise taxes.&nbsp; Said he voted against the bailout plan twice, even against members of his own party.<BR><BR>6:17<BR>Nixon said Hulshof is firing off lies because he's down in the polls.<BR><BR>Said he met a man who lost his job because of some of the policies Hulshof voted for in Congress.<BR><BR>"We need a governor who will compete everyday, not point the finger at others."<BR><BR>6:18<BR>Hulshof said the second injury fund expenses have gone up more than 400% in Nixon's administration.<BR><BR>6:19<BR>Nixon said groups dealing with weatherization and low energy income assistance should be merged together to become more efficient.<BR><BR>Said if government programs are merged and narrowed there can be more efficient and take more responsibility.<BR><BR>6:20<BR>Hulshof said he would create an inspector general position not appointed by the governor, who would monitor the state government to cut down on cronyism.<BR><BR>"My administration will be open, honest and accountable."<BR><BR>6:22<BR>Nixon said Hulshof was looking at problems as a Washington outsider and criticized the idea of adding another position to make government more efficient.<BR><BR>6:23<BR>Hulshof said he would not raise taxes and has never voted for a tax increase in Congress.<BR><BR>"My record on taxes is not rhetoric."<BR><BR>6:24<BR>Nixon: "I'd hold the line on taxes."<BR><BR>Said Missourians need to make sure they are getting what they pay for.&nbsp; <BR><BR>"I'll invest in Missourians," said Nixon.&nbsp; <BR><BR>6:30<BR>Nixon said his health care plan will restore Medicaid cuts, obtain health care coverage for all children, and get transparency in health care providers.<BR><BR>6:31<BR>Hulshof said his HEALTH Max plan would create health savings accounts for low income Missourians.&nbsp; Hulshof his plan would cover more uninsured people than Nixon's plan.<BR><BR>Medicaid "doesn't provide good health care," he said.<BR><BR>6:33<BR>Nixon said Hulshof's policy costs more than his own and doesn't cover children.<BR><BR>Hulshof said those with an income over $25,000, you are not eligible for health care under Nixon's plan.<BR><BR>Hulshof said he helped pass a bill for SCHIP, which would help insure children.&nbsp; <BR><BR>6:35<BR>"We're at a crossroads here," Nixon said.&nbsp; Hulshof said this in his opening statement.&nbsp; I think this statement was also used at the University of Missouri-Columbia debate.<BR><BR>Nixon said Hulshof's plan didn't deal with children directly.<BR><BR>6:37<BR>Hulshof said the state should not "hit the reset button on Medicaid," because it provides bad health-care only to those who make less than $25,000.<BR><BR>6:38<BR>"Investing in human capital is the backbone of economic development," Nixon said.<BR><BR>Nixon said his education plan would take qualified students who have taken two years at a community college and pay for their tuition at a state college or university.<BR><BR>6:39<BR>Hulshof said he was a product of the "Missouri Dream," that his parents sacrificed so he could go to a public college at University of Missouri-Columbia.<BR><BR>Hulshof said he put forward a higher education funding formula to help provide funding for universities so that it doesn't have to raise tuition.<BR><BR>6:41<BR>Nixon said Hulshof supported the sale of Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority.<BR><BR>6:42<BR>Hulshof said basic education is a civil right and that there was only one physics teacher who graduated in Missouri last year, and he moved to California.<BR><BR>Hulshof said his plans would bring more science and math teachers to Missouri.<BR><BR>6:43<BR>Nixon: "We need to return respect to the profession of teaching."<BR><BR>Nixon said the teachers should be in charge of the classroom and shouldn't have to worry about meeting quotas on graduation numbers.&nbsp;

<p>Last Monday Laura and I worked on a story about whether falling housing prices would impact reassessment values.&nbsp; It was definitely a learning experience, showing that you can never really predict the news.&nbsp; </P>
<p>First off, we drove from the Capitol to Columbia for an interview with the Boone County assessor.&nbsp; While very helpful, the assessor said that housing prices in Boone County had remained stable.&nbsp; He seemed very optimistic that the government would solve the current economic problems and that Missourians would be under less financial stress than those on the coast.&nbsp; We exited the interview discussing how the focus of the story would have to change, when I noticed I had a voice mail from the assistant editor.&nbsp; During our interview, the bailout bill had been rejected and the DOW had fallen 500 points.</P>
<p>While everyone else scrambled to cover the financial&nbsp; crisis, we continued working on our story.&nbsp; Whether as a response to the falling stock market or just by coincidence, no other assessor was willing to give us an interview.</P>
<p><B><I>Posted September 29, 2008</I>:</B> <BR>This past couple of weeks I've been working on an issues piece, trying to set up a background of a ballot issue that would amend the Missouri Constitution to make English the official language of government proceedings.&nbsp; For an issue that some call preventative and that others say does nothing, it is so hot-button.&nbsp; Almost everyone I've talked to thinks the amendment will pass and says it probably won't change anything, but there's a lot of unease on each side.<BR><BR>Personally, I'd like to know if this issue matters to the average person, and also how naturalized citizens, immigrants who did not learn English as their first language, and undocumented immigrants feel about this issue.&nbsp; Does it even matter to them?<BR><BR><B><I>Posted September 11, 2008</I>:</B><BR></P>
<p>2:59 p.m. More than a half hour before the debate, Nixon supporters gathered around the entrances of Gannett Hall, holding posters and handing out stickers.&nbsp; I don't really understand the point of trying to hand out political stickers to a bunch of journalists who are ethically obligated to refuse them.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<p>3:17 p.m. MU Chancellor Brady Deaton is giving opening remarks about the importance of debate to political process.&nbsp; David Lieb is the moderator of the debate.&nbsp; Lieb then introduces the panel and the candidates.&nbsp; This blog will be focusing on Republican candidate Kenny Hulshof and Libertarian candidate Andrew Finkenstadt.&nbsp; Sarah D. Wire is covering Constitution candidate Gregory Thompson and Democratic candidate Jay Nixon.<BR></P>3:21p.m.&nbsp; Hulshof is up first.&nbsp; Hulshof talked briefly about policies in energy, health care, and crime and said he's the only candidate concerned about public schools in Kansas City and St. Louis.&nbsp; "Our state is at a crossroads," he said, continuing to say that he is the only candidate who will bring change.<BR><BR>3:26 p.m. Finkenstadt starts his opening remarks with a moment of silence for 9/11, and Hulshof started his remarks with a personal story about 9/11.&nbsp; I wonder if all candidates will try to work in 9/11 into their opening remarks.&nbsp; Finkenstadt focuses mostly on Libertarian philosophy and how Missouri needs less government interference. <BR><BR>3:40 p.m. Hulshof talks about his health care program in response to a question about an elderly couple who cannot pay for. "We would provide health savings accounts and pay the premium."<BR><BR>3:44 p.m.&nbsp; Finkenstadt said private individuals have a responsibility to pay for the health care of those who cannot pay for it.<BR><BR>3:48 p.m. Finkenstadt said he opposes the death penalty because the chance of executing an innocent person is more horrible than letting a guilty criminal live.&nbsp; "I would most definitely put a moratorium on the death penalty in this state."<BR><BR>3:52 p.m. Hulshof on death penalty: "Moratorium?&nbsp; No." "The right of the innocent to live far outlives the right of the guilty not to die."<BR><BR>3:57 p.m. Hulshof on Nixon's Missouri Promise Plan: "We shouldn't pick community colleges at the expense of four-year&nbsp; institutions."&nbsp; <BR><BR>3:58 p.m. Finkenstadt said if taxes are reduced, more Missourians can spend their money where they want, including education and giving money to scholarships.<BR><BR>4:02 p.m. Hulshof on improving K-12 education: Incentives for math and science teachers to improve K-12 math and science scores.<BR><BR>4:03 p.m. Finkenstadt: Parents should be in charge of funding education and education of children should be managed locally.<BR><BR>4:10 p.m. To a question about what he would do to resolve the lawsuit against Gov. Matt Blunt if it comes up while he is governor, Hulshof said he would resolve it ethically and talked about the importance of having a government people can have confidence in.&nbsp; Finkenstadt said he would post online every document that comes out of the governor's office.<BR><BR>4:13 p.m. Finkenstadt on campaign limits: "I would love to hit the limit."&nbsp; <BR><BR>4:15 p.m. Finkenstadt on nuclear energy and energy alternatives: "Really needs to rely on the free market."&nbsp; Said nuclear power is one of the best options now and that he opposes all government pricing of energy sources.<BR><BR>4:22 p.m. Hulshof: "I'm for any of them...yes to nuclear; yes to solar; yes to hydro-electric."&nbsp; Said Missouri should explore all options to lessen dependence of foreign oil.<BR><BR>4:23 p.m. Hulshof on transportation: Look to improve major highways.<BR><BR>4:25 p.m. Finkenstadt: "In order to provide for the bridges and the roads...there has to be increased spending."&nbsp; Said he would cut funding elsewhere to make roads and bridges more safe.<BR><BR>4:30 p.m. Finkenstadt closing statements: "It's time to reboot our government." Said a vote to a third party is not a waste of a vote but a vote in the right direction.<BR><BR>

<p>A week has passed and the excitement and controversy surrounding Palin hasn't died down.&nbsp; At the very least, she's brought publicity&nbsp;to McCain's campaign. </P>
<p>Wait, who's McCain again? </P>
<p>The spotlight has narrowed such on the vice presidential appointments--Biden and Palin--that it's taken away from the debate between McCain and Obama.&nbsp; While the vice president is an incredibly lofty position, it's ultimately the presidential candidates responsibility to lay out positions on issues and to set the tone for a campaign. </P>
<p><STRONG><EM>Posted August 29, 2008</EM>:</STRONG> </P>
<p>From reporting on the gubernatorial race during the day to watching the Democratic National Convention at night, my days and nights have been overflowing&nbsp;with election speeches, campaign ads, and political party events. </P>
<p>With Barack Obama officially named the first black presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin appointed as John McCain's running mate, stltoday.com has stated, " history will be made in this election. We will either elect the first black president in U.S. history or the first female vice president."&nbsp; </P>
<p>Although I think this point is a diversion from the issues the public should be looking at, it is obviously one campaign strategists <EM>want</EM> us to look at.&nbsp; With McCain's appointment of Palin, he is linking his age and experience with her youth and maverick spirit.&nbsp; The opposite could be said of the Obama campaign, where Biden's appointment might give his campaign the experience to win over voters.&nbsp; </P>
<p>So now that both youth and experience have been combined, campaigns have been stressing the barriers they will break.&nbsp; Both the speeches of Hillary and Bill Clinton and Barack and Michelle Obama contained references to how their life stories were an example of the American Dream.&nbsp; Hillary Clinton's battle for the Democratic nomination was portrayed as a big crack in the glass ceiling.&nbsp; </P>
<p>In a campaign centered on change, talking about broken barriers comes with the territory.&nbsp; It will be really interesting to see if this sentiment is echoed by the McCain campaign now that they are making history as well.&nbsp; And will it even win over the votes of the undecided public?</P>
