Now, it's manifested into giving you the local news you need to know every day on your TV screens!\n\nThe New York native joins us from WLTX-TV in Columbia SC. There she covered presidential visits to the Midlands from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the trial of disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh, the impact of Hurricane Ian in the Lowcountry, and the work of various community activists working to preserve local history, including survivors of the Orangeburg Massacre.\n\nNydja is a Temple University alum (Go Owls!) and is ready to make Kansas City her new home. While at Temple, she received an Emmy nomination for her work on “The Vibe at Temple,” a talk show she created and hosted centering the stories and music of Philadelphia-based hip-hop artists. She launched her professional career at the number one news station in the country WABC-TV in New York where she wore many hats as a desk assistant. Her reporting journey kicked off at KNOE in Monroe, Louisiana where she covered the early impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of Hurricane Laura.\n\nAlthough a NY Giants fan at heart, she’s excited to go to a Chiefs game and cheer them on!\n\nIn her spare time, you could find her becoming immersed in everything the Kansas City community has to offer from the food, to the culture, and the nightlife.

She grew up in Gardner, Kansas, so she is no stranger to KC. She is excited to work in her home market alongside the journalists she grew up watching. \n\nShe attended the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (Go Gophers!) and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism. During college, she interned with The Wake Magazine, WESH2 News in Orlando, Florida, and the talk show ‘Twin Cities Live.’ She also had a mentorship with the Twin Cities PBS show, ‘Almanac at the Capitol.’\n\nShe comes from KSNW News in Wichita, where she anchored and reported. She covered a variety of stories, including farming in the drought, she uncovered the Department of Justice investigation into Wichita Public Schools regarding disciplinary policies and co-hosted a series called ‘Positive Connections’ covering unique and uplifting stories across Kansas. With Positive Connections, she won her first award with the Kansas Associations of Broadcasters for her news feature ‘How a daily greeting led to a friendship in Goddard.’ \n\nShe got her start as a morning reporter, fill-in anchor, and fill-in producer with KAAL News in Rochester, Minnesota. There she covered the death of George Floyd, the distribution of the first COVID vaccines by the Mayo Clinic, and the December 2021 storms and tornados that wiped through southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. \n\nSamantha enjoys connecting with new people daily as a reporter and talking with viewers both online and in person. She is excited to tell the stories of those in her home market. This is a goal she’s had since she was in high school where she first became interested in journalism while reporting for the Blazer News Center. KCTV5 is one of the first newsrooms she stepped foot in, so to now be working here as a journalist is a surreal moment. \n\nWhen she isn’t working, you can find her walking her golden retriever, Schroeder (yes, he is named after the Peanuts comic character). Samantha also likes to explore the Kansas City area, go shopping, and spend time with friends and family. \n\nYou can catch Samantha anchoring Saturday mornings and reporting during the week. If you have any story ideas, please reach out by emailing samantha.boring@kctv5.com or contact her through Facebook or X.
