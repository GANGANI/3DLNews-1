By the time he was 8, he presented the weather forecast on closed-circuit TV for students and staff at his elementary school in south Florida. Mike Lyons, a meteorologist in West Palm Beach, took him under his wing through high school and helped him follow his dream. The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons solidified his keen interest even more. Mike is still in the broadcast industry today! He always told Tyler it’s a labor of love, not money, and Tyler has come to realize that as well.\n\nAfter graduating from Florida State, Tyler worked at WJHG/WECP in Panama City Beach for 4 and a half years. It’s there where he helped steer viewers through one of the worst hurricanes in U.S. history. Category five Hurricane Michael ravaged the Panhandle and even impacted parts of Georgia and Alabama. He stayed at the station for several days to inform residents before, during and after the storm. It was weeks before some normalcy set in. That is, a new normal.\n\nTyler put aside tropical weather for a few years and worked at WJHL in Johnson City, TN for three years. His very first day on the job he had the chance to report in 10 inches of snow!\n\nNow, he is taking on the weekday weather gig at WTVM and is thrilled to be serving you in the warmer Chattahoochee Valley, which is closer to family in Florida. He loves the community, interacting on social media and teaching students about weather by visiting schools. Teachers and administrators, send Tyler an e-mail if you’d like him to come out to your school.\n\nIn his free time, Tyler enjoys cheering on the Noles, eating at local restaurants, traveling and exploring the outdoors. If you have any favorite places in the region for Tyler to check out, feel free to reach out.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-08-17T19:24:58.964Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/TylerAllenderWX","twitter":"TYLERALLENDER","custom_gray_stationname":"wtvm"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T11:08:55.884Z","description":{"basic":"Some light rain in spots across the Valley Thursday thanks to a weak system."},"headlines":{"basic":"Clouds and a few showers Thursday","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/eIZs8sXxiyzW0GdzuRNvIxp5Lbc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"11 AM HRRR 48hr Clouds-Rain 2021.png","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","owner":"tyler.allender@wtvm.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/eIZs8sXxiyzW0GdzuRNvIxp5Lbc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/eIZs8sXxiyzW0GdzuRNvIxp5Lbc=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/kFA_WOscdDNMvSi4mH97OOE9KJc=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","usage_instructions":"cleared","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"21f5196488e1dc928db159ef5a6522a703a45167ec40e41f12a5bb09d84485a3"},"caption":"Clouds and some light rain Thursday, especially south of Phenix City and Columbus.","created_date":"2024-05-30T11:07:44Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Source: WTVM Weather","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":720,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T11:07:44Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"HRRR","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/CT5EU2EAGFHUDM7H3YS7EBOOF4.png","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"Source: WTVM Weather"}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wtvm","websites":{"wtvm":{"website_section":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wtvm","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast","alias_ids":["/weather/forecast"]},"order":{"publishing-sections":2010},"_website":"wtvm","site":{"pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps":"/weather/forecast/","site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{},"parent":{"publishing-sections":"/weather","default":"/weather"},"name":"Forecast","inactive":false,"ancestors":{"footer-content-links":[],"navigation-navbar-links":[],"sales-nav-links":[],"navigation-menu-links":[],"publishing-sections":["/weather"],"default":["/weather"]},"social":{},"node_type":"section","site_topper":{}}},"_website_section_id":"wtvm./weather/forecast"},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/clouds-few-showers-thursday/"}},"_id":"KPKHHJRJDBCJZM772KOGUYSS5U","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wtvm","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast","alias_ids":["/weather/forecast"]},"order":{"publishing-sections":2010},"_website":"wtvm","site":{"pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps":"/weather/forecast/","site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{},"parent":{"publishing-sections":"/weather","default":"/weather"},"name":"Forecast","inactive":false,"ancestors":{"footer-content-links":[],"navigation-navbar-links":[],"sales-nav-links":[],"navigation-menu-links":[],"publishing-sections":["/weather"],"default":["/weather"]},"social":{},"node_type":"section","site_topper":{}}},"_website_section_id":"wtvm./weather/forecast"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/clouds-few-showers-thursday/","hasVideo":false,"hasVideoCenterVideo":false,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/30/former-ua-player-chiefs-defensive-lineman-bonds-out-animal-cruelty-charges-tuscaloosa/","content_elements":[{"_id":"DXUZLIAIAJAYDLKEDTMQHDP6I4","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1717084903160,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"alignment":"left","content":"TUSCALOOSA Ala.

By the time he was 8, he presented the weather forecast on closed-circuit TV for students and staff at his elementary school in south Florida. Mike Lyons, a meteorologist in West Palm Beach, took him under his wing through high school and helped him follow his dream. The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons solidified his keen interest even more. Mike is still in the broadcast industry today! He always told Tyler it’s a labor of love, not money, and Tyler has come to realize that as well.\n\nAfter graduating from Florida State, Tyler worked at WJHG/WECP in Panama City Beach for 4 and a half years. It’s there where he helped steer viewers through one of the worst hurricanes in U.S. history. Category five Hurricane Michael ravaged the Panhandle and even impacted parts of Georgia and Alabama. He stayed at the station for several days to inform residents before, during and after the storm. It was weeks before some normalcy set in. That is, a new normal.\n\nTyler put aside tropical weather for a few years and worked at WJHL in Johnson City, TN for three years. His very first day on the job he had the chance to report in 10 inches of snow!\n\nNow, he is taking on the weekday weather gig at WTVM and is thrilled to be serving you in the warmer Chattahoochee Valley, which is closer to family in Florida. He loves the community, interacting on social media and teaching students about weather by visiting schools. Teachers and administrators, send Tyler an e-mail if you’d like him to come out to your school.\n\nIn his free time, Tyler enjoys cheering on the Noles, eating at local restaurants, traveling and exploring the outdoors. If you have any favorite places in the region for Tyler to check out, feel free to reach out.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-08-17T19:24:58.964Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/TylerAllenderWX","twitter":"TYLERALLENDER","custom_gray_stationname":"wtvm"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T11:10:20.110Z","description":{"basic":"A dry middle of the week with relatively low humidity for late May."},"headlines":{"basic":"Wonderful Wednesday, Looking ahead to next rain chance","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"WJ7SDAJWOFEQDBVFTIL7IMQIYI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/Momv-Y7b4JUBZrEQYSrc8djFGtU=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/WJ7SDAJWOFEQDBVFTIL7IMQIYI.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"HOME Next 12 Hours -
