","longBio":"William Rioux is the 5 p.m. weeknight anchor and investigative reporter at News 12 26.  He is a graduate from the University of South Carolina with a degree in broadcast journalism in 2020. \n\nRioux has been a part of the News 12 26 team since June of 2020. He started out as a multimedia reporter and producer while working his way up to weekend morning anchor and weekday reporter within a few months. This is where he fell in love with being on the desk and reporting out in the field. \n\nRioux moved into the weekend evening anchor position and then on to the weeknight evening anchor position during his time with News 12 26. He learned the importance of telling impactful stories in the community. Later on, Rioux joined the I-TEAM as an investigative reporter after finding a passion for holding officials accountable and exposing wrongdoing in the community. \n\nNews wasn't something he always wanted to do growing up. It wasn't until late in his senior year of high school that he figured he'd try and make a career in sports reporting. Little did he know news was what he'd fall in love with. \n\nRioux grew up in Toledo, Ohio, for 16 years before moving to Charleston, South Carolina with his family. He finished out school at Wando High School in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. \n\nFrom August to December, you can bet that Rioux is glued to a TV screen watching his favorite college football team... The Michigan Wolverines (Go Blue!). He will always be a South Carolina Gamecock at heart, though.

","longBio":"Sydney Hood grew up in Swainsboro, making her no stranger to the CSRA. \n\nGrowing up, she watched local and national news just about every morning before school and every evening before bedtime. From an early age, she knew she could transform her love for history, passion for asking questions and natural curiosity into a career. \n\nSydney interned for WRDW/WAGT during the summer of 2022. She joined the weekend team as a part-time multimedia journalist in August 2022 (a few days shy of the start of her senior year in college). She’ll join the team as a full-time MMJ in June 2023. \n\nShe will graduate from the University of Georgia in May 2023 with dual degrees in journalism and political science, a minor in communication studies and a certificate in news literacy. \n\nThroughout her time in college, she has remained active in various extracurriculars outside of the classroom. She serves as president of DiGamma Kappa (UGA’s oldest broadcasting society), writes and delivers on-air content for the student radio program, writes for the Cox Institute’s Journalism Writing Lab and volunteers with Extra Special People. \n\nDuring her freshman year at UGA, Sydney found Grady Newsource, the university’s television program, and started working as a technical volunteer, eventually becoming a senior production manager. She would later work her way up to reporter, opening the door to her covering Stacey Abrams’ 2022 run for governor of Georgia. \n\nIn her free time, she enjoys running, biking, playing tennis and cooking (although she isn’t very good at it, but she loves a good challenge). She is excited to work with the News 12 team and looks forward to connecting with the Augusta community.

Known for asking a million questions before many can answer the first, journalism is something that has always “been in her blood.” \n\nThe stepping stones to broadcasting began for her at the early age of six, when she was awarded “Classroom Reporter” at the end of her kindergarten year. \n\nHallie is a Georgia native who grew up in Thomasville. She graduated with a B.A. in journalism and a minor in communication studies from the University of Georgia in May 2022. \n\nDuring her time as a reporter in Augusta she has covered breaking news from plane crashes, floods, school shootings, and Augusta’s largest fentanyl drug bust to investigative pieces into the murder of Krystal Anderson and massage parlors operating illegally without proper training or licensing. \n\nIn 2019, Hallie was the youngest of six to be awarded the E. Lanier Finch Broadcasting scholarship by the Georgia Association of Broadcasters for her avid drive and skills of chasing her dream. She interned in Washington, D.C. with Congressman Austin Scott’s communications team and with The JOY FM. During this time, Hallie’s passion for journalism grew even stronger as she learned how to improve her storytelling abilities to captivate an audience. \n\nHallie enjoys working out, cooking, pouring into her church small group, and spending time with friends when she is not on the clock. If you have any story ideas, feel free to connect with Hallie.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"18","custom_gray_stationname":"wrdw","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-05-20T17:12:32.579Z","role":"Weekend Evening Anchor/ Reporter ","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082280244612&mibextid=LQQJ4d"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:28:09.500Z","description":{"basic":"We’re putting the focus on food as the need for summer meals and young farmers continues to grow.

WRNN-TV(Rye Brook, NY) Producer \nNews Philosophy: Information can be more powerful than anything else in this world and no one understands that better than the journalists who pursue it every day. We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

From an early age, she knew she could transform her love for history, passion for asking questions and natural curiosity into a career. \n\nSydney interned for WRDW/WAGT during the summer of 2022. She joined the weekend team as a part-time multimedia journalist in August 2022 (a few days shy of the start of her senior year in college). She’ll join the team as a full-time MMJ in June 2023. \n\nShe will graduate from the University of Georgia in May 2023 with dual degrees in journalism and political science, a minor in communication studies and a certificate in news literacy. \n\nThroughout her time in college, she has remained active in various extracurriculars outside of the classroom. She serves as president of DiGamma Kappa (UGA’s oldest broadcasting society), writes and delivers on-air content for the student radio program, writes for the Cox Institute’s Journalism Writing Lab and volunteers with Extra Special People. \n\nDuring her freshman year at UGA, Sydney found Grady Newsource, the university’s television program, and started working as a technical volunteer, eventually becoming a senior production manager. She would later work her way up to reporter, opening the door to her covering Stacey Abrams’ 2022 run for governor of Georgia. \n\nIn her free time, she enjoys running, biking, playing tennis and cooking (although she isn’t very good at it, but she loves a good challenge). She is excited to work with the News 12 team and looks forward to connecting with the Augusta community.
