<p class="MsoNormal"><b>HAMILTON -</b> Marion Countys connection to the rest of 
the world is not as far away as we would like to think lately. Most of the time 
we think that the world just rolls along without even knowing that Marion County 
exists, until things like this make us realize what kind of world we really live 
in. We could go back in time and probably count too many horrible acts of 
violence in and around Marion County that has shocked us here and maybe even 
down to Birmingham. But it has been very few times that a nationally broadcast 
act of violence like this has had a personal connection to Marion County.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we mentioned Jon Benet Ramsey to anyone here or anywhere 
else in the world, its hard to think anybody would say Jon Benet Who? One of 
the questions puzzling the whole country for the past ten years has been Who 
killed Jon Benet Ramsey? Countless mini series have been dedicated to this and 
it was a mystery until a few days agoor is it still? The media is questioning 
the validity of John Mark Karrs confession of the killing of little Jon Benet 
Ramsey almost ten years ago. Mr. Karr was asked on national television  Are you 
an innocent man? and Mr. Karr stated No.&nbsp; Now we get to Marion Countys 
latest connection to the worldJohn Mark Karr. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you mentioned the name John Mark Karr in Hamilton, 
Alabama a few days ago, very few people would have known whom you were talking 
about. But these days the world is saying his name like its a household word 
and we, in Marion County, are saying it with a different tone. John Mark Karr 
was a graduate of Hamilton High School in 1983 and had attended since he moved 
here to live with his grandparents in the 70s. After a brief marriage in Marion 
County, he went to Georgia to work with his father.&nbsp; In 1996, Mr. Karr returned 
to Marion County and was a substitute teacher in the Marion County education 
system, but was let go after about 3 months of work for questionable practices 
and complaints from parents. Mr. Karr went to Franklin County and substituted 
briefly but was let go there also. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As of 2001, Mr. Karr had lost a teaching job in California 
when he was brought up on charges of child pornography for which he pled not 
guilty. Mr. Karr fled California in 2001 and has been on the run for the past 
five years, teaching in many different countries and ending up with a job in 
Thailand this year. Mr. Karr was arrested shortly after starting this job.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the time of this article, the validity of Mr. Karrs 
claims are still in question. The authorities are stating that the only evidence 
linking Mr. Karr to the Jon Benet Ramsey case is his own confession. John Mark 
Karrs ex-wife stated that he (Mr. Karr) couldnt have killed Jon Benet Ramsey 
because Mr. Karr was with her (Mr. Karrs ex-wife) during the whole Christmas 
season in 1996. It was stated that Mr. Karr was also working in Franklin County 
up until December 18, 1996 and Mr. Karr returned to classes in January 1997. It 
was also stated by Mr. Karrs father that John Mark had a fascination with the 
Jon Benet Ramsey case and Mr. Karrs brother stated that Mr. Karr was doing 
research on a book about killers in child cases and had been doing this for a 
while. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All we can do is wait and watch to see if our connection to 
the world continues to be that of horror or if this turns out to be a hoax 
perpetrated by a disturbed man obsessed with this type of case. </p>
