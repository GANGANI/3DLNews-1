<br>
&quot;Step forward now, policeman. <br>
How shall I deal with you? <br>
Have you always turned the other cheek? <br>
To My church have you been true?&quot; <br>
<br>
The policeman squared his shoulders and said, <br>
&quot;No, Lord, I guess I ain't, <br>
Because those of us who carry badges <br>
can't always be a saint. <br>
<br>
I've had to work most Sundays, <br>
and at times my talk was rough, <br>
and sometimes I've been violent, <br>
Because the streets are awfully tough. <br>
<br>
But I never took a penny, <br>
That wasn't mine to keep.... <br>
Though I worked a lot of overtime <br>
When the bills got just too steep. <br>
<br>
And I never passed a cry for help, <br>
Though at times I shook with fear. <br>
And sometimes, God forgive me, <br>
I've wept unmanly tears. <br>
<br>
I know I don't deserve a place <br>
Among the people here. <br>
They never wanted me around <br>
Except to calm their fear. <br>
<br>
If you've a place for me here, Lord, <br>
It needn't be so grand. <br>
I never expected or had too much, <br>
But if you don't.....I'll understand. <br>
<br>
There was silence all around the throne <br>
Where the saints had often trod. <br>
As the policeman waited quietly, <br>
For the judgment of his God. <br>
<br>
&quot;Step forward now, policeman, <br>
You've borne your burdens well. <br>
Come walk a beat on Heaven's streets, <br>
You've done your time in hell.&quot; </b></p>
