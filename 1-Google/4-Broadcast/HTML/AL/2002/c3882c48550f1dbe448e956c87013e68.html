Her love for people and desire to share their stories is what propels her to be relatable, kind, and informative. Reporting for FOX10 is a dream come true for Ashlyn ever since she moved from her home in Hannibal, Missouri in 2018 to pursue an education at the University of Mobile in Mobile, Alabama. Ashlyn likes to say she is “Midwestern by birth, but Southern by heart.”\n \nIn 2018, Ashlyn discovered UM when she competed at the Distinguished Young Women National Competition in Mobile as the Distinguished Young Woman of Missouri. She quickly fell in love with the hospitality and genuine community of Mobile. Mobile made such an impression on her that she decided to attend UM only weeks before classes began her freshman year.\n \nAshlyn graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor of arts in communication and minors in French and government. With a passion for speaking and networking with others, Ashlyn has worked in many leadership capacities. Ashlyn worked at the Mark Twain Cave in her hometown of Hannibal, Missouri as a tour guide for four years. In high school, she earned several prose and oratory awards as well as being named Student of the Year her senior year. During her college career, she earned presidential scholastic awards, served as vice president of the UM Ambassador Program, interned for the marketing department, managed social media for the Student Life Office, volunteered as a Ram Rush Leader, and worked as a graduate assistant in Residential Life. Ashlyn also served as the communications coordinator for Redemption Church in Saraland, Alabama for a year.\n \nAshlyn is currently pursuing her master’s in leadership and communication from the University of Mobile in hopes of earning her PhD in communication studies one day.\n \nAshlyn currently serves as Miss University of Mobile 2022, a preliminary for Miss Alabama. She has developed her own nonprofit and social impact initiative, HeadBAND Together. This initiative focuses on fighting street harassment by equipping men and women with practical training to advocate for safety in public settings. When Ashlyn isn’t working or volunteering, she loves to spend her time writing, playing pickleball, and spending time with friends and family.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wala","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-16T15:56:49.971Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"20","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ashlynnicholsfox10news/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:34:14.985Z","description":{"basic":"Court

She is an anchor and on the 6 On Your Side Investigates team.\n\nTwo days after graduating from college, Morgan Hightower began her journalism career in Montgomery, Alabama. Nearly a decade and a few other jobs later, she is proud to be back in Alabama.\n\nWhile in Montgomery, Morgan was part of a team that built the newsroom at the ABC affiliate. She was involved in all areas of the newscast, from shooting, writing and editing all her stories, to producing and hosting. Being part of a small team meant that Morgan had the opportunity to cover several big stories, including a federal corruption trial, the State House and most memorably, the deadly tornado outbreak in April 2011. She shared the stories of countless people rebuilding their lives, followed recovery efforts and tracked down lost FEMA payments.\n\nFrom Montgomery, Morgan moved to Greensboro, North Carolina and worked at the CBS affiliate for five years as a reporter, later promoted to an anchor. While proud of the investigative work she did tracking taxpayer money and holding the powerful accountable, she will never forget the chance she had to cover the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Bedford, Virginia. Morgan rode a bus with dozens of World War II veterans, sharing the stories of how they saved the world. Her station earned an EMMY for its coverage of that memorable day.\n\n\nMorgan has worked as an anchor and reporter in Nashville, Tennessee. She covered crime, corruption and politics. The stories that will have a lasting impact are the heartbreaking mass shootings at a church and Waffle House in Antioch. She anchored for several hours on the days of the tragedies and followed both stories for months, covering the criminal investigations and court cases.\n\nBorn and raised in Orlando, Florida, Morgan is a graduate of the University of Florida, but she appreciates the Auburn/Alabama rivalry! She and her husband feel truly blessed to be back in Alabama, the place they met, got married and will now raise their family. They have a young son and daughter. \n\nIf you have any story ideas for Morgan, please feel free to email her at

Lee, along with the rest of the news team, evacuated to a nearby hospital, where they stayed on air throughout the entire storm. Lee recalls it was a defining moment for the station.\n\n\"We did wall-to-wall coverage and stayed on air during the storm. This was a time when people needed life-saving information. It put into perspective what was important,\" said Lee. \"You also learned to appreciate the little things -- like running water and hot meals.\"\n\nWhile in Lake Charles, Lee also served as the station's weekend anchor. Lee says whether out in the field or on the desk, he was always there to tell the stories that mattered.\n\n\"That's always been important to me. My first news director was a tough critic, but at the end of the day she always wanted to hear a great story. I've never forgotten that and remind myself that's what I'm here to do -- tell great stories that impact viewers,\" said Lee.\n\nLee's work has been honored by the Louisiana Associated Press Broadcasters Association, including several first-place awards.\n\nWhen he's not at work you can find Lee exploring the Mobile area.

Hal worked as a news photographer for the CBS affiliate there for several years before moving to Mobile, Ala. in 1989. He covered news there for the next nine years, winning several press awards along the way for stories he covered. In that time, he realized this is where he wanted to call home. He married Mobile native Anne Kelly and they've since had three beautiful children.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008 Hal took a break from broadcast news, but not from television. He dove off into the world of independent television production shooting, producing and editing both local and national cable television shows.

Emily followed Ole Miss baseball’s postseason run and attended the College World Series in July to cover the rebels for HottyToddyNews. She says it was one of the best experiences of her entire life. Hotty Toddy!!\n\nEmily is over the moon to be back on the coast. She says it is a dream come true to cover sports in the heart of SEC country.

Now, Josh serves the community as an On Your Side Investigator. He hopes to be able to continue telling stories that make a difference. \n\nPrior to joining WBRC, Josh was a reporter with Bay News 9, the 24-hour non-stop breaking news cable channel in Tampa, Florida. Most recently, he covered the Seffner sinkhole that swallowed and killed a man while he slept, a story that made national and international headlines.\n\nJosh started his one-man-banding career with WJHG, the NBC affiliate in beautiful Panama City Beach, Florida. The most bizarre story he says he covered there was a man who chained himself to his outside power box to help save his daughter's life.\n\nAs an Alabama native, Josh grew up in the small city of Valley, Alabama. He graduated with a Broadcast Journalism degree from Troy University in 2007 and worked at the on campus station \"TrojanVision News\".\n\nOver the years, Josh's work has been recognized by the Florida Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, and also a portion of his work received an Emmy nomination as part of a team effort.\n\nJosh is an avid sports fan. One of his first jobs was shooting video of players for a minor league baseball team in Columbus, Georgia. He is an old school music fan (anything Motown) and is learning to speak Spanish.\n\n\"If you're around me for any given time, you'll hear me laugh a lot,\" Josh says about himself. \"An older gentleman once told me, ‘Son, laughter just makes your soul feel good!'\"","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"joshua-gauntt","source":{"source_id":"22857056"},"status":true,"twitter":"joshg_TV","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-06T19:11:21.052Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:35:05.216Z","description":{"basic":"Efforts
