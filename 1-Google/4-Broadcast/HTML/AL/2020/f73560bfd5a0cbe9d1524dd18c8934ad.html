partly to mostly sunny sky the high will be in the 88-92 degree range for most communities. Any showers this afternoon should be few and far between.{/p}{p}An organized band of thunderstorms will push into North Alabama tonight, and will drop southward into the central counties of the state during the pre-dawn hours tomorrow.{/p}{p}Storms are possible as early as 7-8 p.m. across the Tennessee Valley... they should reach the I-20 corridor (Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Anniston, Gadsden) by 4-5 a.m. tomorrow.{/p}{p}The main concern is from strong, potentially damaging straight line winds, although an isolated brief tornado can't be ruled out. The higher tornado probabilities are north of Alabama.{/p}{p}The greatest chance of severe storms tonight will be along and north of U.S. 278 (Hamilton to Cullman to Gadsden)... the line should weaken early tomorrow morning as it approaches I-20.{/p}{p}TOMORROW: Much of the morning will be dry, but scattered thunderstorms will develop ahead of a cold front tomorrow afternoon. It won't rain everywhere, but where storms form they could be strong to severe with hail and strong winds possible. We do not see a tornado threat tomorrow afternoon; highest coverage should be over the southern 2/3 of the state.{/p}{p}REST OF THE WEEK: At this point the weather looks dry and pleasant Tuesday through Friday with lower humidity levels and cooler nights. Many North Alabama communities will likely reach the 50s early Thursday and Friday morning.{/p}{p}Showers and storms will likely return to Alabama at times over the following weekend (June 1-2).{/p}","forecast":{"externalServiceId":"USAL0054","zipCode":"35212","state":"Alabama","stateAbbreviation":"AL","city":"Birmingham","latitude":"33.371","longitude":"-86.8","current":{"relHumidity":87,"wndSpdMph":10,"wndDirDegr":"210","wndDirCardinal":"SSW","snowAmtIn":"N/A","tempF":77,"precipChance":"100","iconCode":103,"skyText":"Cloudy"},"weatherForecasts":[{"relHumidity":73,"wndSpdMph":11,"wndDirDegr":"247","wndDirCardinal":"WSW","snowAmtIn":"0","dateTime":1716811200000,"dayOfWeek":"Monday","origHiTempF":88,"origLoTempF":66,"origPrecipChance":80,"origIconCode":96,"origSkyText":"AM Thunderstorms","modifiedHiTempF":null,"modifiedLoTempF":null,"modifiedPrecipChance":50,"modifiedIconCode":null,"modifiedSkyText":null,"modifiedPrecipitationChanceDay":null,"modifiedPrecipitationChanceNight":null,"hiddenWind":false,"modifiedWindDirectionCardinal":null,"modifiedWindDirectionCardinalNight":null,"modifiedWindDirectionDeg":null,"modifiedWindDirectionDegNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKm":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKmNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKn":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKnNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedMph":null,"modifiedWindSpeedMphNight":null,"hiddenHumidity":false,"modifiedRelativeHumidity":null,"modifiedRelativeHumidityNight":null,"hiddenUv":false,"modifiedUvDescription":null,"modifiedUvIndex":null,"modifiedUvWarn":null,"phraseDay":"Thunderstorms during the morning hours, then skies turning partly cloudy during the afternoon.

partly to mostly sunny sky the high will be in the 88-92 degree range for most communities. Any showers this afternoon should be few and far between.{/p}{p}An organized band of thunderstorms will push into North Alabama tonight, and will drop southward into the central counties of the state during the pre-dawn hours tomorrow.{/p}{p}Storms are possible as early as 7-8 p.m. across the Tennessee Valley... they should reach the I-20 corridor (Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Anniston, Gadsden) by 4-5 a.m. tomorrow.{/p}{p}The main concern is from strong, potentially damaging straight line winds, although an isolated brief tornado can't be ruled out. The higher tornado probabilities are north of Alabama.{/p}{p}The greatest chance of severe storms tonight will be along and north of U.S. 278 (Hamilton to Cullman to Gadsden)... the line should weaken early tomorrow morning as it approaches I-20.{/p}{p}TOMORROW: Much of the morning will be dry, but scattered thunderstorms will develop ahead of a cold front tomorrow afternoon. It won't rain everywhere, but where storms form they could be strong to severe with hail and strong winds possible. We do not see a tornado threat tomorrow afternoon; highest coverage should be over the southern 2/3 of the state.{/p}{p}REST OF THE WEEK: At this point the weather looks dry and pleasant Tuesday through Friday with lower humidity levels and cooler nights. Many North Alabama communities will likely reach the 50s early Thursday and Friday morning.{/p}{p}Showers and storms will likely return to Alabama at times over the following weekend (June 1-2).{/p}","forecast":{"externalServiceId":"USAL0054","zipCode":"35212","state":"Alabama","stateAbbreviation":"AL","city":"Birmingham","latitude":"33.371","longitude":"-86.8","current":{"relHumidity":87,"wndSpdMph":10,"wndDirDegr":"210","wndDirCardinal":"SSW","snowAmtIn":"N/A","tempF":77,"precipChance":"100","iconCode":103,"skyText":"Cloudy"},"weatherForecasts":[{"relHumidity":73,"wndSpdMph":11,"wndDirDegr":"247","wndDirCardinal":"WSW","snowAmtIn":"0","dateTime":1716811200000,"dayOfWeek":"Monday","origHiTempF":88,"origLoTempF":66,"origPrecipChance":80,"origIconCode":96,"origSkyText":"AM Thunderstorms","modifiedHiTempF":null,"modifiedLoTempF":null,"modifiedPrecipChance":50,"modifiedIconCode":null,"modifiedSkyText":null,"modifiedPrecipitationChanceDay":null,"modifiedPrecipitationChanceNight":null,"hiddenWind":false,"modifiedWindDirectionCardinal":null,"modifiedWindDirectionCardinalNight":null,"modifiedWindDirectionDeg":null,"modifiedWindDirectionDegNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKm":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKmNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKn":null,"modifiedWindSpeedKnNight":null,"modifiedWindSpeedMph":null,"modifiedWindSpeedMphNight":null,"hiddenHumidity":false,"modifiedRelativeHumidity":null,"modifiedRelativeHumidityNight":null,"hiddenUv":false,"modifiedUvDescription":null,"modifiedUvIndex":null,"modifiedUvWarn":null,"phraseDay":"Thunderstorms during the morning hours, then skies turning partly cloudy during the afternoon.
