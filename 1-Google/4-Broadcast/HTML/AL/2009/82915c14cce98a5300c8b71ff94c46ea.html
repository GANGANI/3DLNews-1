He is the Morning Meteorologist, and you can catch his forecasts Monday-Friday on Today in Alabama. This is Tyler's 4th stop on his TV meteorology journey, and it's the first time he has worked outside of the snowy and cold Midwest. His first three stops were all well to the north:\n\n•Rockford, Illinois\n•Lima, Ohio\n•South Bend, Indiana\n\nWhile in the Midwest, Tyler covered several severe weather events, tornado warnings, snowstorms, ice storms, intense heat, and wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero!\n\nFor as long as he can remember, Tyler has wanted to work as a meteorologist somewhere in the South. That's because severe thunderstorms and tropical systems are his favorite types of weather to cover and study. So he couldn't be happier to be in Montgomery, covering the wild weather that central and southern Alabama sees. \n\nTyler graduated from The Ohio State University in 2015 with a bachelor's of science in atmospheric science and a bachelor's of arts in psychology. While at Ohio State, he was heavily involved in the student-run television station and the university's meteorology club. \n\nBut his love and passion for weather dates all the way back to 1st grade. That's when he began drawing his own weather maps and delivering his own forecasts to family and friends. By 3rd grade, Tyler memorized all 50 states and capitals, fueling his interest in geography. \n\nIn his free time, Tyler enjoys exploring new places and going on adventures to parks, beaches, restaurants, and breweries.

Living in these three cities while growing up, each with very different climatic conditions, steered him in the direction of meteorology.\n\nAfter wrapping up high school, Nick moved to Starkville, Mississippi and spent four years at Mississippi State University where he graduated Cum Laude honors with a bachelor’s degree in geosciences, majoring in broadcast meteorology and minoring in communication. While at Mississippi State, he was an active member of the East Mississippi Chapter of the NWA and AMS.\n\nNick's first job took him to WTVA in Tupelo, Mississippi, working part time while still studying at Mississippi State. During his time in North Mississippi, he kept viewers safe during a tornado outbreak in April 2014. After graduating from MSU, he landed his next job at WTOK in Meridian, Mississippi where for three years he provided weather information during morning newscasts and also reported on various stories. While in Meridian, Nick helped forecast several tornado outbreaks, including the major Collinsville tornado of February 2016. Nick's next stop was at WSFA's sister station WMC Action News 5 in Memphis. There Nick provided critical weather information during tornado outbreaks, severe winter storms and various tropical systems.  \n\nAfter three years in Memphis, Nick was ready to come home to Alabama! He is excited to join the WSFA 12 First Alert weather team and provide critical weather information to the viewers of the Capital City and across the great state of Alabama. When not forecasting the weather on WSFA, Nick enjoys spending valuable time with his family and friends. Cheering for both the Mississippi State Bulldogs and Auburn Tigers. He also likes trying new foods, traveling across the country, and watching the latest must see TV shows and movies.

This is Tyler's 4th stop on his TV meteorology journey, and it's the first time he has worked outside of the snowy and cold Midwest. His first three stops were all well to the north:\n\n•Rockford, Illinois\n•Lima, Ohio\n•South Bend, Indiana\n\nWhile in the Midwest, Tyler covered several severe weather events, tornado warnings, snowstorms, ice storms, intense heat, and wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero!\n\nFor as long as he can remember, Tyler has wanted to work as a meteorologist somewhere in the South. That's because severe thunderstorms and tropical systems are his favorite types of weather to cover and study. So he couldn't be happier to be in Montgomery, covering the wild weather that central and southern Alabama sees. \n\nTyler graduated from The Ohio State University in 2015 with a bachelor's of science in atmospheric science and a bachelor's of arts in psychology. While at Ohio State, he was heavily involved in the student-run television station and the university's meteorology club. \n\nBut his love and passion for weather dates all the way back to 1st grade. That's when he began drawing his own weather maps and delivering his own forecasts to family and friends. By 3rd grade, Tyler memorized all 50 states and capitals, fueling his interest in geography. \n\nIn his free time, Tyler enjoys exploring new places and going on adventures to parks, beaches, restaurants, and breweries.

Over the years, WBRC FOX6 News reporter Josh Gauntt has found himself on a few of those front lines telling stories of survival, heartache, and affecting change with government.\n\nJosh joined the WBRC FOX6 News team in July 2013 as a reporter covering Tuscaloosa and other parts of West Alabama. Now, Josh serves the community as an On Your Side Investigator. He hopes to be able to continue telling stories that make a difference. \n\nPrior to joining WBRC, Josh was a reporter with Bay News 9, the 24-hour non-stop breaking news cable channel in Tampa, Florida. Most recently, he covered the Seffner sinkhole that swallowed and killed a man while he slept, a story that made national and international headlines.\n\nJosh started his one-man-banding career with WJHG, the NBC affiliate in beautiful Panama City Beach, Florida. The most bizarre story he says he covered there was a man who chained himself to his outside power box to help save his daughter's life.\n\nAs an Alabama native, Josh grew up in the small city of Valley, Alabama. He graduated with a Broadcast Journalism degree from Troy University in 2007 and worked at the on campus station \"TrojanVision News\".\n\nOver the years, Josh's work has been recognized by the Florida Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, and also a portion of his work received an Emmy nomination as part of a team effort.\n\nJosh is an avid sports fan. One of his first jobs was shooting video of players for a minor league baseball team in Columbus, Georgia. He is an old school music fan (anything Motown) and is learning to speak Spanish.\n\n\"If you're around me for any given time, you'll hear me laugh a lot,\" Josh says about himself. \"An older gentleman once told me, ‘Son, laughter just makes your soul feel good!'\"","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Reporter","slug":"joshua-gauntt","source":{"source_id":"22857056"},"status":true,"twitter":"joshg_TV","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2021-05-06T19:11:21.052Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wbrc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:35:05.216Z","description":{"basic":"Efforts

Growing up, while his friends were busy watching Netflix shows and cartoons, Simon was busy watching documentaries and NBC Nightly News. Sure enough, when he saw that Broadcast Journalism classes were being offered at his middle and high schools, he jumped at the opportunity to get involved.\n\nSimon is a graduate of Troy University with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Political Science. While at Troy, Simon was a staff member at TROY TrojanVision News – the university’s television station -- where he served as a jack of all trades: anchoring, directing, and reporting. During his time in college, he was able to intern at WSFA's sister station, WBRC FOX6 News in Birmingham.\n\nIn his spare time Simon enjoys going to the gym, discovering new music, watching sports (Go Trojans + Go Dawgs!) and finding interesting trivia quizzes about any random topic he can think of.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-04-19T22:25:41.338Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T03:24:06.895Z","description":{"basic":"Chief

Growing up, while his friends were busy watching Netflix shows and cartoons, Simon was busy watching documentaries and NBC Nightly News. Sure enough, when he saw that Broadcast Journalism classes were being offered at his middle and high schools, he jumped at the opportunity to get involved.\n\nSimon is a graduate of Troy University with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Political Science. While at Troy, Simon was a staff member at TROY TrojanVision News – the university’s television station -- where he served as a jack of all trades: anchoring, directing, and reporting. During his time in college, he was able to intern at WSFA's sister station, WBRC FOX6 News in Birmingham.\n\nIn his spare time Simon enjoys going to the gym, discovering new music, watching sports (Go Trojans + Go Dawgs!) and finding interesting trivia quizzes about any random topic he can think of.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-04-19T22:25:41.338Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T03:19:51.242Z","description":{"basic":"A

Her love for people and desire to share their stories is what propels her to be relatable, kind, and informative. Reporting for FOX10 is a dream come true for Ashlyn ever since she moved from her home in Hannibal, Missouri in 2018 to pursue an education at the University of Mobile in Mobile, Alabama. Ashlyn likes to say she is “Midwestern by birth, but Southern by heart.”\n \nIn 2018, Ashlyn discovered UM when she competed at the Distinguished Young Women National Competition in Mobile as the Distinguished Young Woman of Missouri. She quickly fell in love with the hospitality and genuine community of Mobile. Mobile made such an impression on her that she decided to attend UM only weeks before classes began her freshman year.\n \nAshlyn graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor of arts in communication and minors in French and government. With a passion for speaking and networking with others, Ashlyn has worked in many leadership capacities. Ashlyn worked at the Mark Twain Cave in her hometown of Hannibal, Missouri as a tour guide for four years. In high school, she earned several prose and oratory awards as well as being named Student of the Year her senior year. During her college career, she earned presidential scholastic awards, served as vice president of the UM Ambassador Program, interned for the marketing department, managed social media for the Student Life Office, volunteered as a Ram Rush Leader, and worked as a graduate assistant in Residential Life. Ashlyn also served as the communications coordinator for Redemption Church in Saraland, Alabama for a year.\n \nAshlyn is currently pursuing her master’s in leadership and communication from the University of Mobile in hopes of earning her PhD in communication studies one day.\n \nAshlyn currently serves as Miss University of Mobile 2022, a preliminary for Miss Alabama. She has developed her own nonprofit and social impact initiative, HeadBAND Together. This initiative focuses on fighting street harassment by equipping men and women with practical training to advocate for safety in public settings. When Ashlyn isn’t working or volunteering, she loves to spend her time writing, playing pickleball, and spending time with friends and family.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wala","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-16T15:56:49.971Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"20","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ashlynnicholsfox10news/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-27T03:36:20.214Z","description":{"basic":"Nikki
