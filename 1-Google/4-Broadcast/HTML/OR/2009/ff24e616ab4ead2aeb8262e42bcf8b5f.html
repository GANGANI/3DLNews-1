But treaty or not, scientists say climate change is coming.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In our final chapter of the Denmark Project, producer Christy George found new voices – psychologists, philosophers and poets - wrestling with the enormity of the changes facing the place they call home.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The tiny town of Denmark sits on Highway 101, halfway between the two tourist towns of Bandon and Port Orford. <br/>That whole stretch is unincorporated, so you could call the area "greater Denmark."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Denmark itself is still home to the descendants of the Scandinavians who first settled the area in the late 1800's. <br/>Bonnie Cox and Wilbur Jensen are part of the Jensen century farm family.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bonnie Cox: "If you ask about the weather, we’re always acclimating to it. It’s a subtle thing. It’s kind of hard to say how it’s changed."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Wilbur Jensen: "The severity of storms is not as great as was then. It’s stil not unusual to get 100mph gusts of wind that will hit this area here. "</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Their mother, Wilma Jensen, remembers the Columbus Day storm of 1962.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Wilma Jensen: "Oh that was bad and I stood right here and watched the barn and it just caved in and out and in and out and whoooosh, there went the top!"</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Jensens are right - climate change means generally warmer, milder weather. But scientists say it also means hotter summers and more rain than snow on the mountains to the east; warmer water and higher waves on the Pacific Ocean to the west. And above all, more unpredictable weather.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">More storms. More wind. More rain.

Pretty normal kind of weather for winter here."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">If this is an average storm, what will future storms look like? And how can the people who live in Greater Denmark protect themselves?</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">There are only six ports in the world quite like Port Orford.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">There’s no breakwater here, so fishermen tie their boats to a 25-ton winch and they’re lowered right into the open ocean.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">This unique port is home to a different breed of fisherman.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton: "I am a salmon fisherman first, but I don’t get much opportunity anymore."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton is president of the Port Orford Ocean Resource Team, or POORT, a group of fishermen who’ve done some radical things.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Over the last decade, team members voluntarily put several square miles of their fishing grounds off limits, in a marine reserve.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">And right now, the fishermen are trying to cut out the middlemen and sell directly to restaurants.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton: "We want to maintain our heritage, and maintain access to our fisheries."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lyle Keeler: "We definitely do have climate change in this area."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lyle Keeler is the group’s secretary–treasurer.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lyle Keeler: "We’re catching species in the ocean we’ve never caught before."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton: "It isn’t like all of a sudden the water is fluorescent green or purple or anything. You know what I mean, it’s just little things that you see, maybe more dead birds."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Port Orford was about to rewrite its stormwater ordinance, and the fishermen and the city decided to work together.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton: "Twenty-five percent of the income that comes into this community is derived from fishing. With the multiplier effect, especially in a small town that doesn’t have any corporate interests, the only way money leaves this town is out of the Circle K or the gas stations. A dollar spent in Port Orford stays in Port Orford a long time."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Science writer Joseph Cone of Oregon Sea Grant was on the lookout for a coastal town where decision-makers were preparing for climate change, to test a new way to communicate about climate change.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Joe Cone: "The old model of turning the fire hose of science onto unsuspecting civilians and hoping good things happen, I just don’t think it works very well."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He started by convening a workshop in Port Orford.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Joe Cone: "So we began by asking everyone ‘what do you mean by climate change effects?’ "</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Briana Goodwin: "We had flip chart paper and wrote down the impacts of climate change."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Briana Goodwin was a brand new intern at the fishermens’ group when she went to Joe Cone’s workshop.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Joe Cone: "Then we said, ‘All right, what risks are associated with those effects? How can you lessen the risks?' "</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Briana Goodwin: "And then we went a step further and wrote down whose responsibility that was."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Joe Cone: "Because they care about Port Orford, they were willing to go through this workshop process to help them come up with a better approach to keep their community the way they wanted it to be."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Joe Cone is just one of many social scientists: lawyers, political scientists and sociologists, trying to figure out how to tell the climate change story in a way that will motivate people to act.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Dominic Della Sala: "Denmark fits within a bioregion, an eco-region known as the Klamath-Siskyou, which is considered world-class by a number of ecological measures, the conifer richness, the uniqueness of place and the unusual number of species known nowhere else on Earth."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Dominic Della Sala is an ecologist-turned regional climate forecaster for the National Center for Conservation Science and Policy in Ashland.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He says it's hard for people to think about how climate change matters to them when most models cover huge areas. <br/>Dominic Della Sala - We take those global models and we zoom in, and we say 'what is that going to mean for the town of Denmark Oregon?'</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">By the turn of the next century, he says, the temperature on Oregon’s coast could rise between four and ten degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Dominic Della Sala: "So by thinking about preparing for climate change in terms of what do you need to do about sea level rise and what you need to do about increasing temperature, they start to question, well, in addition to preparing for it, we need to do something do to stop this!"</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Sound of gavel at the Port Orford planning commission meeting: "Okay, we will open the public hearing continuation of the stormwater ordinance...."</p><div class="article-body--padding article-body__media"><table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" width="320"><tbody><tr><td><iframe height="360" src="http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?%20user_id=9429884@N08&amp;set_id=72157622922259338/" width="320"></iframe></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bioswale Projects - Photos by Christy George</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Port Orford’s Planning Commission started work on a new stormwater ordinance last spring, and it stretched into the fall.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The idea was to require new construction or re-developed buildings to drain stormwater off roofs and sidewalks and into the ground.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris: "We’re in the visitors center parking lot for Gold Beach Visitors’ Center. This is a bioswale built just this year, finished about three weeks ago."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris is the Oregon State Extension agent for Curry County.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris: "I’m not sure how much climate change is really going to affect stormwater management, except for the fact that we’ll have higher rates of volatile storms and therefore more need to control the runoff."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The county built this as a demonstration project to show how a bioswale, or a rain garden, catches and holds the water until it drains naturally into the soil.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris: "A lot of the rushes and sedges are down in the bottom...."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Native plants drink in some of the water. And the plants also help filter out impurities.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris: "And there’s one fairy fern around here someplace."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">What Frank Burris wants to do is change individual behavior – one home at a time.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Frank Burris: "Then, you can take people down and say, this is what it looks like, this is what you can do this on your own property, your own level, and I’d like to see thousands of these in parking lots and in private backyards all throughout Curry County."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Convincing one person at a time is slow, whether your goal is to change your town, your state, your country – or the whole world.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But social scientists say there are shortcuts.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Psychologist Bob Doppelt founded the Climate Leadership Institute at the University of Oregon.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt: "A team of scientists brought together some social scientists like me and said this is a real problem, this global warming thing but we can’t make political or social traction, what should we do?"</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He helped organize Climate Masters classes in Eugene.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">People learned how to calculate their carbon footprints by looking at utility bills to see how much energy they used, and gas receipts to figure out their miles traveled.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt: "We’ve been measuring the changes that’ve been happening in the environment, in the climate, through good science, to understand that we have a problem, but now, really, we have to focus in on the root causes of problem, which is our economic and social practices and policies."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">A recent poll by Yale and George Mason Universities found that 69% of Americans now think climate change is real, but - only eight percent said they’d taken any political action, like calling a government official.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt: "And sometimes it’s because they’re denying, sometimes because the change feels too big, or sometimes because they don’t think they can succeed in making the change."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt calls that the “disinterest” phase. He says people go through distinct stages as they change their beliefs. His goal is to move people out of disinterest and into the next stage: deliberation.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt: "‘Is this good for me or is it not? Will it help others, will it not?’ And usually it’s only when the pros – the benefits of a new approach - outweigh the downsides by at least two to one, will people make a fundamental shift."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But, he says, no one has made a great case yet for the benefits of acting on climate change.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The benefits of acting aren’t simply financial. In fact, social scientists say money is not the key to changing people’s minds about climate change, or anything else.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Ronald Mitchell: "We all put tips in the tip jar at our local coffee shop."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Ronald Mitchell is a political scientist at the University of Oregon. He specializes in why nations do and don’t comply with international environmental agreements – like the climate treaty on the table in Copenhagen this month.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Ronald Mitchell: "We tip because we see a tip jar and it communicates as a person coming into the coffee shop, that people around here tip."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">And, he says, it’s those social norms that really make people change their behavior.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Ronald Mitchell: "What we really like to do as humans and what we really focus on and are sensitive to and alert to is what other people do."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Take the study done for a California electric company.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Researchers tried different methods of encouraging customers to conserve, but what really clicked was when people learned how much energy they used compared to their neighbors.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">If they conserved more, the power company put a smiley face on their power bill, but if they conserved less, they got a frowny face.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">And power usage dropped.</p><div class="article-body--padding article-body-ad"><div class="ad-container f_primary border articleBody

In fact, they’re leading the state.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Mayor Jim Auborn presided over the November meeting of the Port Orford City Council.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Jim Auborn: "Motion to adopt ordinance 2005...

And I think that was my favorite part."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Jim Auborn: "Signing this will be really good, so let’s vote on it. Carolyn?  The ordinance has passed and it’ll go into effect 30 days from today, so thank you."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">City manager Mike Murphy is braving that early winter storm to show off what Port Orford has already built.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Mike Murphy: "We’re looking right here and now at a bioswale...."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Port Orford’s bioswale was funded by the same Ford Family Foundation grant that funded the bioswale in Gold Beach, and another up the road in Langlois.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Mike Murphy: "It’s so simple to do, it’s something that doesn’t cost anything, it’s a very minor requirement and eventually more and more people will be doing it and it will make a big, big difference.

We’d never run out of trees, we’d never run out of fish, we’d never run out of anything, you know. And to think that mankind could have any type of effect on the environment was just incomprehensible to him."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He grew up in a world without limits. But these days, the limits are becoming quite apparent.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Bob Doppelt: "Any kind of social change ultimately is a struggle over power and authority – that’s reality - who’s got it, who doesn’t."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Aaron Longton: "So many things seem to be out of our control, at least in any immediate type of change.
