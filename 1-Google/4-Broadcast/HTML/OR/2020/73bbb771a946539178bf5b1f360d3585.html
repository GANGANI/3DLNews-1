The drop left thousands of Oregonians without jobs, and counties lost hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But the singularly focused narrative, the only one most Oregonians know, masked another devastating shift for towns like Falls City.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Wall Street real estate trusts and investment funds began gaining control over the state’s private forestlands. They profited at the expense of rural communities by logging more aggressively with fewer environmental protections than in neighboring states, while reaping the benefits of timber tax cuts that have cost counties at least $3 billion in the past three decades, an investigation by OPB, The Oregonian/OregonLive and ProPublica found.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/6NBRCMATQJG3TNUSRG5D7YCLSA.jpg?auth=447710835cd1a06dc021d19c77fb7f1072865b3ad517be7986e558c26b3075dc&amp;width=150" alt="A tree sapling grows in an industrial forest in Oregon’s Coast Range." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:3000 / 2000;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>A tree sapling grows in an industrial forest in Oregon’s Coast Range.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Half of the 18 counties in Oregon’s timber-dominant region lost more money from tax cuts on private forests than from the reduction of logging on federal lands, the investigation shows.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Private timber owners used to pay what was known as a severance tax, which was based on the value of the trees they logged. But the tax, which helped fund schools and local governments, was eliminated for all but the smallest timber owners, who can choose to pay it as a means to further reduce annual property taxes.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The total value of timber logged on private lands since 1991 is approximately $67 billion when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis of data from Oregon’s Department of Forestry. If the state’s severance tax had not been phased out, companies would have paid an estimated $3 billion during the same period. Instead, cities and counties collected less than a third of that amount, or roughly $871 million.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Polk County, home to Falls City, has lost approximately $29 million in revenue from timber sales on federal land. By comparison, the elimination of the severance tax and lower property taxes for private timber companies have cost the county at least $100 million.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“You have that tension between this industry that still employs people, but we’re losing some of the benefits of that relationship,” Falls City Mayor Jeremy Gordon said. “As those jobs diminish, there’s less and less support to subsidize that industry in the community.”</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">'A completely different business model'</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Oregon's connection to the timber industry is so tightly knit that casinos, high school mascots and coffee roasters take their names from mills, loggers and stumps.

Small timber owners, who grow forests that are older and more biologically diverse than what corporate owners manage, have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In western Oregon, at least 40% of private forestlands are now owned by investment companies that maximize profits by purchasing large swaths of forestland, cutting trees on a more rapid cycle than decades ago, exporting additional timber overseas instead of using local workers to mill them and then selling the properties after they’ve been logged.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Such intensive timber farming contributes to global warming because younger trees don't store carbon dioxide <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/sciencef/scifi195.pdf" target=_blank>as well as older ones</a>.

But, on the ground, plantations of trees crammed together are often eerily barren, devoid of lush vegetation and wildlife.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said that he and his advisers were alarmed by the shift toward investor-driven forestry during his last of three terms in office. By then, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/forestscience/article/58/2/119/4604528" target=_blank>forest ecologists</a>, <a href="https://www.opb.org/admin/edit/5ede99526a2f2f019f9402a7/fs.fed.us/spf/coop/library/timo_reit.pdf" target=_blank>the U.S. Forest Service</a> and even a <a href="https://efmi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1_EFM-Lit-3_Ecosystem-Based-Forestry-Investment-Strategy-FINAL.pdf" target=_blank>former chief investment officer for Hancock</a> had published papers warning that investor-driven forestry was ecologically damaging and less capable of sustaining rural communities.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“They have a completely different business model,” Kitzhaber, a Democrat, said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Kitzhaber, who received <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&f-fc=2&law-eid=1348943&d-cci=9#[%7B1%7Cgro=d-id" target=_blank>nearly $200,000</a> in contributions from timber-connected donors while in office, supported multiple industry-backed measures during his tenure. He led a <a href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/lpro/publications/2006oregonsalmonplanf.pdf" target=_blank>plan to save Oregon's salmon</a> that relied on <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/141/4548" target=_blank>voluntary measures from timber companies</a> instead of regulations, and he signed into law a massive tax cut for the industry that's still felt in many counties.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“The current state isn’t working,” Kitzhaber said in an interview. It may benefit investors, he said, “but it’s not working for small mill owners. It’s not working for rural communities.

Many debt-laden companies began selling off forestlands. Meanwhile, changes in the federal tax code made timber an attractive investment that wouldn’t crash with the stock market.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Under federal tax law, pension funds and other investors can acquire forestlands without paying the corporate taxes incurred by traditional timber companies that mill their own products. Those corporate taxes can reach 35%. Investors in the company instead pay a capital gains tax closer to 15%.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the 1990s, as federal logging plummeted, timber prices skyrocketed, making those investments look even smarter, said Brooks Mendell, president of the forest investment consultancy Forisk.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Overnight, private landowners had something that became more valuable,” Mendell said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"><b>Federal payments to Oregon's western counties dropped precipitously</b></p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/WNEBB7QC2FFWDBNNQOT4CNTCBI.png?auth=5f7e124d7809b286ead84a39f389287170c0fa8d95797719937eaac22347b438&amp;width=150" alt="Source: Headwaters Economics " class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:1240 / 1040;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>Source: Headwaters Economics </p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Lylla Younes</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Investors jumped at the opportunity to own timber, and existing companies like Weyerhaeuser restructured to take advantage of the tax breaks.
