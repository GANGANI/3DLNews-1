Bend Fire warns you never walk on ice on the river, do not allow animals on the ice, and do not attempt to rescue animals on the ice.&nbsp;Instead, call the fire department: we are trained and equipped to handle this type of incident.</span></p>						</div>

Police believe that the robberies could be connected, based on information from the investigation. The theft of personal property and cash was the motive for the robberies. In all cases, one or two individuals accompanied the suspect. They are described as a male, possibly Latino, about 5&rsquo;8&rdquo; with a medium build. He could have a handgun. They were driving a dark colored compact sedan.&nbsp;If you have any information about these events, contact Bend Police at 541-693-6911.</p>						</div>

Bachelor Thursday night.&nbsp;Around 5:30, the search team along with other search teams from around the State and Mt. Bachelor Ski Patrol began the search for Jake Denham, 14, of Portland.&nbsp;Apparently Denham was last seen on the hill around 3 p.m. getting on the NW Express Ski lift. Around 2 a.m., Denham was found on Mt. Bachelor in good condition. He had lost one of his skis while skiing down a steep slope. He was able to get out of the steep terrain and build a snow enclosure to get out of the elements. When rescuers found him, it was -5 degrees outside. He was taken to the Mt. Bachelor Guest Services Building where he was evaluated by paramedics and reunited with his family.</p>						</div>

Bachelor on Wednesday serves as a reminder; when weather conditions change quickly and we get a lot of snow, the danger is there.&nbsp;Andy Goggins with Mt. Bachelor says they have daily avalanche patrols:&nbsp;&quot;Especially with the last week's storm cycle bringing in about 57 inches of new snow in less than 5 days.&rdquo;&nbsp;No one was injured in Wednesday's small avalanche and it was business as usual on Mt. Bachelor yesterday. &nbsp;Weather experts remind you to watch the conditions and your immediate surroundings.&nbsp;Ken Boone with the Weather Channel:&nbsp;&quot;Also the terrain your in because that can be a factor as well.&rdquo;</p>						</div>

Bachelor is fully open again today, after an avalanche closed part of the mountain Wednesday.&nbsp;Spokesman Andy Goggins says a resort guest reported the avalanche at 10 a.m. and the resort's Avalanche Team responded to make sure no one was injured or trapped under the snow.&nbsp;&ldquo;There we no victims reported to be caught in the slide. But the Mt. Bachelor Ski Patrol kept that area closed and proceeded to run a full search procedure, including the use of our avalanche dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp;It occurred near the top of the Skyliner Express chairlift.&nbsp;Weather experts say the recent quick change in temperatures and a large amount of snow are prime avalanche conditions.&nbsp;Ken Boone with the Weather Channel: &nbsp;&ldquo;You know every time it snows and you get a new layer of snow on top of each other, the bond in between the layers isn&rsquo;t necessarily always strong. Sometimes if you get a weak enough bond in between those packs of snow maybe you get a lighter snow and then you get a heavier snow on top of that. That bond in between the two different layers could cause an avalanche as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;Boone says steep terrain is another avalanche factor.&nbsp;So if you're going out in the back-country he suggests that you're constantly aware of the weather conditions and forecast; and your immediate surroundings.</p>						</div>

James Savage says the water was almost an unwelcome guest in one home:&nbsp;&quot;And with the warmer weather and the heavy rains and the snow started to melt, it was more than the ditch could handle. &nbsp;It went over the banks and pooled in an area and this one residence at 2555 Paulina Highway had water right up to the back of the house.&quot;&nbsp;Savage says crews stayed overnight to make sure that the water couldn't get into the home. &nbsp;He says this happens often when there's a rapid snowmelt and heavy rains. &nbsp;If you live near a drainage ditch it's important to clear out any debris so it doesn't get clogged and add to the problem.</p>						</div>

I felt I did my job in a very competent manner. I kept the interests of the District front and center all the time. You know, people may have disagreed with some of the decisions I made, but first and foremost I always want folks to know that I was keeping the best interests, in total, of the people of this District in mind.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiegler has been working with Jason Conger to make sure the transition in Salem is a smooth one.&nbsp;Stiegler doesn't plan to run&nbsp;for public office again, but she admits you never say never.</p>						</div>

Many people truly believe that what you eat, who you kiss or who enters your home at midnight will affect the new year for you. Local clairvoyant and astrologer Eileen Lock says these traditions can work for you, if you believe in them.&nbsp;&quot;We all have a belief in something. And I really believe at the beginning of the year everybody kind of goes back to that.&nbsp;All Christmas season and all holiday season there's all this 'believe, believe' all around, written everywhere. And it's like; remember, believe in the magic. Believe whatever you believe in and then focus on that. And so I think that's kinda what happens.&quot;&nbsp;Lock says there is always a special emphasis on New Years because people want to start a brand new year with a clean slate; that they take time to reflect on the past and find ways to improve or change and then in essence, make their own good or bad luck.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>From Snopes.com other superstitions include: stocking up your cupboards &amp; having plenty of cash in your wallet to ensure prosperity. Paying off your bills and settling debts. Also, the first person who enters your home will influence what kind of year your will have. Ideally, he would be tall, dark haired, good looking and carrying gifts, including a coins and salt. Finally, open your doors to let the old year out and make a loud noise to scare away evil spirits so they can&rsquo;t enter your home in the new year.</p>						</div>

Crook County Search and Rescue were activated and they began to build a defensible wall of sandbags on the east side of the residences to prevent the water from coming into the house.&nbsp;Heavy rain and snowmelt along with debris in the culverts are determined to be the cause of the high water. Crews monitored the situation overnight and will continue to watch today. No homes were damaged.</p>						</div>

More towards a continued improvement level which is based on performance, which means we are not going to fund something that is not performing, and let's define what performance is.&rdquo;&nbsp;Telfer says one example is instead of asking how many people received food stamps; we need to ask how many people were able to get off food stamps. Telfer says many in Salem play a shell game with the numbers.&nbsp;She questions the shortfall and says the State will have a $1.4 billion increase in revenue next biennium.&nbsp;She says the practice of calling a reduction in a proposed budget a &quot;cut&quot; is deceptive and has to stop because it's not a true cut in services.</p>						</div>

A hearing officer approved a zone change that affects about 256 acres dedicated to light industrial uses. The space can also be used for office space for corporate or regional headquarters.&nbsp;The next step will be to break the land into separate parcels and create a marketing plan. In a published report, Bend Development Manger Jerry Mitchell says &quot;the zone was our last big push in getting land to the market; it's a big milestone for us.&quot; once completed, Juniper Ridge could have a similar feel as Northwest Crossing.</p>						</div>

Apparently no appraisal had been done on the land. On October 12th Governor Ted Kulongoski, who chairs the State Land Board halted to sale to review the sale. This prompted at Department of Justice to examine if ethics laws were followed.&nbsp;Now the state is retooling procedures in purchasing land to make sure everything is above board.&nbsp;</p>						</div>

Brian Stallcop has an Edward Jones Office in West Bend.&nbsp;&ldquo;That's right; so if you do that this year,&nbsp;you'll actually realize the taxable income in 2011 and 2012. And that's a unique opportunity, you won't be able to do that after this year.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone's situation is different, depending on your age, income and goals.&nbsp;So it's important to talk to tax and financial planning experts before you decide.</p>						</div>

In fact, our base total range is from five to seven feet here on the mountain.&quot;&nbsp;The summit backside's opening day was today, and that means all 360 degrees of the mountain can be used for skiing or snowboarding. Jackson says the terrain park is also up full speed. You can see all of Mt.

SO the first thing the Treasurer is doing is reminding people, hey, if you&rsquo;ve got there cards, spend them. It&rsquo;s money and if you sit on them for too long, there are certain kinds of cards, even with Oregon and national laws now, that still allow for inactivity fees and for the cards to expire.&rdquo;&nbsp;He says you also want to make sure the packaging isn't tampered with because that could mean someone has stolen the pin number and then all the money off the card.</p>						</div>

The resolution will be voted on the first day of the new Congress, in January. &nbsp;Transition Chair Greg Walden says it provides a series of reforms to the current rules including: the stipulation that no rules shall be voted upon without bring available on line for at east three calendar days and reforms in the budgeting process that places limitations on long-term spending. In addition, the rules will reinstate a six-year term limits on committee chairs. In a statement released from Congressman Walden, he says: &quot;These new rules put in place the congressional reforms proposed in the Pledge to America.&nbsp;The package makes it easier to address one of the top priorities of the American people: cutting spending.&quot;&nbsp;You can review the highlights of the reforms by clicking <a class="links" target="_blank" href="http://rules-republicans.house.gov/News/Read.aspx?id=442">here</a>.</p>						</div>

A recent report from the FDIC shows that the Bank of the Cascades has the largest amount of the deposits in Deschutes County, at 29%.</p>						</div>

Anyone in Oregon who says they don't believe in Santa Claus might want to check first with the North American Air Defense Command. NORAD is responsible for keeping the airspace safe in North America.&nbsp;Every Christmas Eve its' radar spots Santa racing around the world and dropping off tons of gifts.&nbsp;So how does he get all that work done in just one night? Lt. Stacey Knott with NORAD says it might take a little bit of magic.&nbsp;&quot;We&rsquo;ve asked him about that. Santa&rsquo;s kind of in a different kind of time plane, and so the time is a little different for him. That&rsquo;s how he is able to get all around the world in that little bit of time.&quot;&nbsp;Knott says Santa usually starts his rounds in the Eastern Hemisphere, and when he arrives in North America, NORAD's fighter jets intercept him to ensure a safe journey.&nbsp;Knot says there are about 1200 uniformed and civilian volunteers who work each Christmas Eve to answer phone calls and e-mails requesting information about Santa&rsquo;s whereabouts. NORAD has been helping Santa for about 50 years. You can link to the NORAD Santa Tracker at KBND.com.</p>						</div>

Another man then head-butted Mills, causing an injury to him, but not from the knife. &nbsp;The assailant fled the scene.&nbsp;When Bend Police and Bend Fire arrive on the scene, they bandaged Mills head and took him to St. Charles for further evaluation. &nbsp;There were no charges or arrests at this point in the investigation. If you have any information, contact Bend Police.</p>						</div>

And she fell through the ice and was stranded in the middle of the pond.&quot;&nbsp;Keith Kessaris with Awbrey Glen Golf Club says the elk was getting tired trying to find a way out of the pond. The elk was up to her neck in icy water.&nbsp;It took Bend City crews, Bend Police and Awbrey Glen workers combining their efforts to rescue the elk out of the pond. They got a small boat and were able to lasso the elk.&nbsp;Then, using another rope tied to the boat, they were able pull her out of the water. The who incident took about an hour. The good news is no one, including the elk was hurt in this incident. Kessaris says about three years ago, a heard of about 30 elk discovered the abundant food in Awbrey Glen and have come down every winter.</p>						</div>

Mike Lovely is a gay man who served in the army in the 1960's.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish this would've happened a long time ago; but at least I'm living to see it.&quot;&nbsp;Mike Lovely says he's running out of patience and believes that gays should've been allowed to serve openly in the military years ago.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting impatient. Not only for me but for everybody else. And it also brings to mind my uncle, who is gay, served in the second World War in North Africa and Japan and six months before is was to retire, after many years of service, somebody found out he was gay and he got run out and never got a dang dime of retirement from the military and that still burns my craw.&rdquo;&nbsp;Meantime; some of the frontline soldiers have said they believe openly gay soldiers will create a distraction and undermine the military.&nbsp;Stephen Bomar with the Oregon Military Department:&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to comment on any specific soldier and what their opinion is. But front line, rear detachments, whichever policy is in place is the one that will be enforced and adhered to. And I think that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re looking at full implementation taking up to a year. It&rsquo;s getting it down to every unit. You have to conduct the training and implement the policy. That will change many subjects to include family programs, hoe that is handled, reintegration. &ldquo;&nbsp;The President is expected to sign the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell on Wednesday.</div>						</div>

The rules are now under revision. Some conservation groups want president Obama to push for stronger rules to protect wildlife, fish, public access and drinking water sources. Jane Danowitz with the Pew Environment Group says the new rules will be a blueprint for how national forests should be managed:&nbsp;&quot;It means that, where activities such as logging should take place, it should be done in a sustainable manner.&nbsp;And where valuable fish and wildlife habitat should be protected, the government needs to be required to take steps to do so.&quot;&nbsp;The groups have signed a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack describing their &quot;holiday wishes&quot; for stronger rules and a commitment to scientific review in the new forest management policies. The first draft for public comment is expected as early as January.</p>						</div>

Local counselors say they see a lot of anxiety and depression cases this time of year.&nbsp;Jane Meyers has been a counselor in Bend for 18 years.&nbsp;She says the shorter days, higher expectations and strained family relationships add together for a &quot;perfect storm.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<div>And now the economy is one more factor:&nbsp;&quot;People are dealing with economic pressures and that always comes together because of the holidays.&nbsp;And this year it's even worse because so many people in our community and really across the world are dealing with severe economic issues; and some people have the boss that lays them off just before Christmas.&nbsp;You always hear those stories of some people that this happens to.&quot;&nbsp;Meyers says depression can lead to suicide.&nbsp;So it's important to watch for warning signs. Some signs include: talking about suicide, no hope for the future, withdrawing from others and a sudden sense of calm.</div>
<p>Meyers was a guest this morning on KBND's &quot;Your Town.&quot;&nbsp;</p>						</div>

Ben Gregory doesn't have an answer as to why this is the case; but says its definitely unusual:&nbsp;&ldquo;In years past I have been here for 21 years and I recall never having this many homicides in any given year.&nbsp;I recall years when we didn't have a homicide, but I do know in the last three years, we have one in 09; one in 08 and one in 2007. &nbsp;This year is exceptional.&rdquo;&nbsp;Lt. Gregory says the impact of this has meant a lot of extra hours for detectives, but the emotional toll has been perhaps worse for Police and the overall community.&nbsp;</p>						</div>

Police seized the BB gun believed to be used as evidence . No injuries have occurred, but Ben Police Officer John Lawrence tells our news partner, News Channel 21, a passenger was sitting beside the window struck in one instance -- and could have been hurt, had the projectile landed inside or the window shattered. &nbsp;Norman is lodged in the Deschutes County Juvenile Detention Center.</p>						</div>

If your credit or debit cards have a &ldquo;(((&ldquo; symbol; they are vulnerable.</p>						</div>

As a result of his &quot;Alford Plea&quot; he is guilty of one count of racketeering, four counts of first degree aggravated theft and one count of offering to work as a contractor without a license.&nbsp;An Alford Plea is one where the defendant does not admit guilt, but recognizes that there is evidence against him that could&nbsp;lead to a conviction.&nbsp;Wisehart was charged with stealing more than 2-million dollars from his clients by way of cash, services or equipment. Wisehart was accused in 2009 with 29 counts of racketeering, theft and working as a contractor without a license.&nbsp;By Wiseharts&rsquo; agreeing to the six counts, prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining 23 charges. He could end up serving a maximum of 61 years in prison with over a million dollars in fines. Sentencing has not been scheduled.</p>						</div>

One of his employees has gained state wide accolades for his conscientious work at the jail.&nbsp;Crook County Sheriff's Office Jail Commander Al Bond was recently chosen as the Oregon State Sheriff's Association Jail Commander of the year. And the reason is clear; he is able to maintain the jail with some real positive reinforcement:&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's to treat people the way the way you'd want to be treated and do you best to do the right thing, is the model that we use from where we learned at the command college that I attended 3-4 years ago. And I try to hold those standards, even prior to that time and up to today.&quot;&nbsp;Sheriff Clark says Bond has a very effective way of handling prisoners:&nbsp;&ldquo;In order to keep inmates happy and compliant and not looking for ways to cause trouble and escape, he's developed several programs that rewarded the prisoners for positive activity. And they've responded really well to that. They have a nickname; they call it 'Grandma's House'&quot;.&nbsp;Clark says Bond's programs and methods of running the jail have saved them plenty of money over the years. He adds that he really had to trick the normally humble Bond into coming to the convention where he was surprised with the award.</p>						</div>

Wednesday, around noon, Redmond Fire was called to a fire in an outbuilding off on O'Neil way.&nbsp;&quot;In those pens, the owner has some pigs and she was using a heat lamp to help keep them warm.&nbsp;One of the heat lamps had come loose and dropped lamp-side down onto the straw, which ignited. Luckily a couple of contractors were going to that residence to do some work, discovered the fire early on and were able to extinguish it with a garden hose.&quot;&nbsp;Redmond Fire Marshal Traci Cooper says when Redmond Fire arrived on the scene, they made sure the fire was completely out.&nbsp;No pigs were harmed.&nbsp;Cooper says if you need to use a heat lamp, make sure it is well away from any combustible material and out of range for the livestock to bump it, causing it to dislodge and come into contact with the bedding materials. If in doubt, you can always call the fire department and they can inspect your set up.</p>						</div>

So they are on the stump to let people know about their efforts.&nbsp;&quot;Tomorrow (Thursday) night they're having a free concert at Summit High School at 7:30 p.m.&nbsp;And you can actually hear the band that's going to be going to Carnegie Hall in April 2011.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be selling tickets to the jazz concert on Sunday at the Riverhouse.&nbsp;Cameron Clark has generously donated part of the proceeds of each ticket sale from the Summit High School kids to help us with our the fundraiser.&quot;&nbsp;R</span>obson says the kids are thrilled to be one of 18 high school bands chosen in the nation to perform. The 44 band members need to raise about $70,000.&nbsp;They are about a third of the way there. Again, they will have a free performance at Summit High Thursday night at 7:30 p.m.; The concert is free, but they will gratefully receive any donations at the door.</p>						</div>

A recent survey of Oregon voters indicates that Walden is the most admired elected official currently serving Oregon. The website Oregoncatalyst.com reports that Walden, the lone Oregon Republican in Congress, was the overwhelming choice.&nbsp;Walden says he has always thought that the House is the &quot;peoples house&quot;; that they are stewards of taxpayers&rsquo; money and the public's business.&nbsp;He says will continue to fight for openness in government and that's what people respond to.&nbsp;Even political and ideological opposite, Congressman Earl Blumenaur says Walden brings a refreshing view to his job. KBND would like to congratulate Greg Walden for being Oregon's most admired elected official.</p>						</div>

In the preliminary draft of the rules on greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA did not consider biomass power a renewable power source, placing it in the same category as fossil fuels.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Congressmen Greg Walden, and Peter DeFazio are leading the charge to encourage the EPA to exempt biomass for what's called the &quot;Tailoring Rule&quot;* until the agency has a chance to review a host of comments they have received on the issue. 32 members of Congress have signed the letter to the EPA. Central Oregon has at least two major biomass power proposals underway; a 20 megawatt power plant scheduled for La Pine and a 35-megawatt plant in development in Warm Springs.&nbsp;The two plants are to cost about $200-million and will bring in about 100 jobs.</span></div>

<div>*EPA's &ldquo;Tailoring Rule &quot;tailors&quot; permitting programs to limit the number of facilities that would be required to obtain new source review and Title V operating permits based on their greenhouse gas emissions. EPA said the threshold would cover power plants, refineries and other large industrial plants while exempting smaller sources like farms, restaurants, schools and other facilities.</div>						</div>

<div>Central Oregon&rsquo;s largest golf event is moving.&nbsp;Next August, the Ghost Tree Invitational, which raises money for&nbsp;local charities will be at the Sunriver Resort and Crosswater Golf Club.&nbsp;For the last five years it's been at Pronghorn, but Ryan Chackel with&nbsp;the Ghost Tree Invitational&nbsp;says the Sunriver facility allows the event to grow it's new celebrity auction.&nbsp;They wanted to move their celebrity auction indoors.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was a priority of ours to move the event indoors; which Sunriver has a lot of options, like the Great Hall and some others that they can present to make that happen for Thursday night.&nbsp;So that&rsquo;s hosting a couple of hundred people inside which isn&rsquo;t easy for some&nbsp;local golf clubs.

And&nbsp;Sunriver has the ability to host our 30 sports and entertainment celebrities in one location so it makes the logistics a lot easier.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Ghost Tree Invitational&nbsp;will be August 11th through the 13th next year.</div>						</div>

Bend Police Sergeant Ron Taylor says often banks and businesses are the victims; &nbsp;but sometimes the consumer gets stuck. &quot;If the bill is of relatively good quality, it is not uncommon for a person or a business who takes that bill to give it back out in change and then it filters down to some unsuspecting citizens.&nbsp;So just because a bill is received from a legitimate business does not always mean that it is a real bill.&quot;&nbsp;Taylor says advanced technology is making it easier for more people to make bad bills.</p>						</div>

We typically pick that up at the Riverhouse from the SYSCO truck; again provided from the Purcell family, SYSCO Foods and the La Pine Food Basket. Deschutes Country Sheriffs Office transports that to La Pine.&quot;&nbsp;Sheriff Larry Blanton says members of the Department along with other volunteers will meet at the Riverhouse next Monday to assemble and deliver the food baskets. Blanton says there are also some toys and needed clothing items included with the baskets; all coming from community donations.</p>						</div>

So we talk about Charles Dickens himself. We talk about the premise of the play. But we also talk about what London was really was like in 1843, which was when the play was set, from Mrs. Cratchit's perspective. The poverty and what times would have been like.&quot;&nbsp;Rebecca Singer, who plays Mrs. Cratchit in the play, says some of the students are chosen to play parts in the scene and many are inspired to find out more about the theatre. A Christmas Carol will be at the Tower Theatre Friday through Monday.&nbsp;You can get more information at the Tower Theatre website.</p>						</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Meanwhile, we won't know the full economic impact for another month of the just completed USA Cyclocross National Championships.&nbsp;But preliminary numbers show the event gave a tremendous off-season shot in the arm to the region's tourism.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Preliminary estimates would reflect direct tourism spending, meaning the money coming out of the tourist's pockets and into cash registers of local businesses at just over a million dollars.&nbsp;It will probably fall at about $1.1- $1.3 million.&nbsp;And then the long term economic impact and the secondary spin will take the total economic impact to between $1.5 and $2 dollars.&rdquo;&nbsp;Doug La Placa of Visit Bend says about 3500 visitors came from almost every state to either race or watch.&nbsp;It's about the same size as the other national cycling championship events, but La Placa says the biggest impact of this event is that it occurred during the off season.&nbsp;This is the final year of the two year USA Cyclocross Championship contract with the cycling organization but La Placa says the event was so successful he is sure Cyclocross will be back in the future.</div>						</div>

The College plans to file a planning application with the with of Sisters on Friday, December 17, seeking an amendment to the Sisters Development Code to allow colleges as a conditionally permitted use in the City&rsquo;s light industrial zone. The Development Code currently allows vocational schools in this zone via a conditional use permit. The purpose of a conditional use permit allows the City to review uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning district but which because of their size; operation or other characteristics require review on a case-by-case basis. As part of the exploration process, Gutenberg officials will be available to answer questions about the college&rsquo;s programs, curriculum and its reasons for selecting Sisters. A community forum is planned for Thursday, December 16 at 5:00 p.m. at the Sisters Library Community Room.</p>						</div>

<div>Sunset Magazine has about 5 million readers. &nbsp;Smith says this article may help bring more tourists to Central Oregon.</div>						</div>

He offers this script:&nbsp;&ldquo;You know we recognize tonight that you&rsquo;ve had a little bit too much to drink and we think its in your best interest not &nbsp;to get behind the wheel of a car and drive. And of course people typically respond with &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;ll be okay, well, you know, if you go out and something were to happen to you, I would just be devastated, because I care too much.&rdquo;&nbsp;Gjesvold says drinking and driving has much more serious consequences in other counties- in one you lose your license for life and in Malaysia, &nbsp;your spouse has to go to jail with you for six months</p>						</div>

They called Bend Police. The suspect gave a false name when police questioned him, but upon investigation, found the car he was driving had switched plates and was actually a car stolen from Kingman, Arizona. &nbsp;They discovered the suspect's real name, Nicholas Swope, 37, from the Dalles and arrested him for outstanding warrants from Skamania County, Washington. &nbsp;Police also discovered over $6200 in forged $20 and $100 bills in his possession and the printer used to produce the bills. Swope was apparently traveling through Bend from Nevada. &nbsp;This case does not appear to be linked to other cases involving forged bills in Bend. Swope is lodged in the Deschutes County Jail on multiple forgery and other charges.</p>						</div>

Or the data will not show that until we have it in place over a period of time.&rdquo;&nbsp;Gjesvold says data shows that one dollar spent in treatment saves $12 to 15 in money not spent on other social services.</p>						</div>

Water Watch spokesman John DeVoe:&nbsp;&ldquo;W</span>hat they do is a pipe full management scheme.&nbsp;The pipe is always full but they aren&rsquo;t using all that water.&nbsp;The water they don't use they move ten miles downstream and dump into Tumulo Creek, and that is wasteful use under Oregon Water Law.&rdquo;&nbsp;But that claim is still under investigation by the Oregon Department of Water Resources. The City of Bend&rsquo;s Justin Finestone says they are taking a look at the complaint.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are attorneys are going to look at the letter and analyze it in detail. And when they&rsquo;re finished with that next week, we&rsquo;ll be able to have a more detailed response. Till we hear differently from the attorneys, we will continue to operate our water system in the same manner that we have operated it for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp;Right now, the City uses about 11-million gallons of water every day from the Bridge Creek Watershed.&nbsp;That's about half of the Bend's daily usage.</p>						</div>

Those two finalists are Mike Hotzclaw and Cheri Helt.&quot;&nbsp;Kinkade says next Tuesday, the Board will decide who will fill Ashby's Zone 1 seat.&nbsp;She adds that they hope the candidate will then run in the May election to complete Ashby&rsquo;s term.

They want to investigate homelessness and poverty. Laura gGangaard with the U of O Service Learning Program says about eight students will do everything from serving meals to interviewing homeless and out of worker people. &quot;Basically just looking at the difference faces of poverty in bend. What it looks like compared to here; different climate, different environment. And they'll be doing some service at various shelters around town; the Bethlehem Inn, the [Bend] Community Center. They&rsquo;ll be talking with representatives at the economic development council and living options for teens. And then doing some other activities around their service issues as well.&quot;&nbsp;Grangaard says hopefully the trip will inspire a lifetime of community service. KBND will keep up with the students to get their impression on the homeless problems in bend and we will report to you their findings next week</p>						</div>

ODF&amp;W spokesman Steven George says once a deer is exposed, there is nothing that can save it. &nbsp;&quot;What they're dying from is a disease called adenovirus hemorrhagic disease. It&rsquo;s a disease specific to just deer. Pets, livestock do not get it, it kills most of the animals that are exposed to it. We had a major outbreak about 6-7 years ago at Crooked River Ranch.&quot;&nbsp;George says they encourage you not to feed the deer because the disease is passed to deer through nose to nose and saliva contact and so it will wipe out a congregating herd. He says a couple of months ago, they were finding about one to two dead deer every day in the Cove Palisades Park and Crooked River Ranch area, but the numbers are going down now.</p>						</div>

City Communications Manager Justin Finestone says the Committee took into account all City Departments when coming up with their recommendations: &nbsp;&quot;The Committee has come up with several recommendations both on the cost containment side and some revenue enhancement. On cost containment we presented them with project growth of City revenues over the next five years. And what they wanted to do was bring personnel costs in line with that growth. So what they're going to recommend to Council is that personnel compensation, City wide not just for police and firefighters certainly, but for all City employees not grow more than revenues.&quot;</p>
<p>The Committee also recommends reductions of some services from the General Fund and to enhance revenue, to deploy a Transportation Utility Fee to replace the Street Maintenance funding that would come out of the General Fund.</p>						</div>

It's not the geese themselves, but the mess they leave behind.&nbsp;Now officials are faced with another decision on dealing with them again.&nbsp;Last summer, they used lethal measures to kill some geese and that caused uproar with animal loving residents. &quot;We&rsquo;re working on a non-lethal program right now and hopefully, that will be successful. We&rsquo;ll know come summer, whether or not we got the job done. We&rsquo;re going to try and beef this program up with some more volunteers and get people involved who have trained dogs that can help herd the geese out of the parks.&quot;&nbsp;Paul Stell with the Parks Department says recent counts indicate there are about 100 fewer geese than the last count, so some of their efforts are paying off. They are working with the City Council to pass an ordinance against feeding the geese in the park.&nbsp;What is your opinion? We have a poll here on the KBND website about controlling the geese population.</p>						</div>

Police say they often see more bad bills passed this time of year because stores are busier. &nbsp;A few days ago, Bend Police arrested three men in an alleged counterfeit ring. &nbsp;Sergeant Greg Owens with the Bend Police Department says better technology seems to make counterfeiting easier.&nbsp;In the recent bust, the bills were described as pretty convincing. &nbsp;Here's what to watch for:&nbsp;&ldquo;When you're looking at money look for things that are odd; does it feel right? Is the paper feel different: is it an odd color? Is it an odd size?? A lot of time they're bigger or smaller than real money.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<div>Cashiers and business owners need to watch for people buying a very low priced item with a large bill.&nbsp;This past weekend- three people each allegedly used counterfeit $20 bills at the 7-11 on south Highway 97. The clerk was able to give police a description of their car leading to a quick arrest.</div>						</div>

He adds that even with a revised application, the cost of the entire project is not yet determined:&nbsp;&ldquo;The bridge and trail project will cost what it will cost. It won't cost anymore. What we've lost is the opportunity to apply for recreation trails program grant in a timely way. That grant application is due on January 14th. We were hoping that we could get the preliminary design work done sufficiently, that we could apply for that grant.&quot; Ronning says there was no assurance that they were going to get part of a $1.2 million from the Oregon State Parks Grant Program. There are other grant programs that they will pursue and now they can begin doing research on those.</p>						</div>

Grandin says the movie has generated publicity about autism, but she was here about her contributions to the cattle industry:&nbsp;&ldquo;Well it certainly created a lot of publicity and I'd say about 90% of the emails I get concern autism but I also get about 10% of correspondence involving livestock, you know and people are happy that some one is out there working on improving for livestock and the public is hungry for information they just want to know how things work.&rdquo;&nbsp;The convention lasted all weekend a featured speakers from topics ranging from new government regulations to how to deal with wolves and a Cowboy Christmas Village filled with local vendors.&nbsp;</p>						</div>

Prosecutors say toxicology reports indicate Stacia Roberts had at least three controlled substances in her blood when the accident on Highway 20 near Black Butte occurred.&nbsp;Two passengers in the car, Joshua Herrin, 19, died at the scene and Nina Blackmore, 18, was critically injured. She was flown to St. Charles Bend, where she died the next day. Roberts and the fourth passenger, Casey Hoyle, 20, were also taken to St. Charles for treatment and were released. &nbsp;The investigation reveals the foursome had spent several hours at Cougar Hot Springs, where they drank beer and smoked marijuana. &nbsp;Witnesses say they saw Roberts' car moving at erratic speeds and weaving. A published report says Roberts had traces of ecstasy, marijuana and some kind of opiate in her blood. Roberts will have to wear a tracking device, alcohol monitoring and submit to random drug testing while she awaits trial. She is released to her parents custody.</p>						</div>

OSP Sergeant Eric Judah says traffic in and around the Corvallis area will be very congested and there are a few tips they have to keep you sane on this high-octane day.&nbsp;&quot;Leave early. If you think it's going to take you 2 hours to get there; then make it 4 hours. Especially closer to kickoff that you get; it's going to get more and more crowded.&nbsp;So leave early, have a lot of patience; give the car in front of you plenty of room. Also, if you see something that looks dangerous, or possible an intoxicated driver, call that in.&quot;&nbsp;Judah says they will have extra patrols out this weekend. They estimate at least an addition 15,000 cars on the roads near Corvallis. And finally, designate a driver if you plan to tailgate with alcohol or drink at the game.</p>						</div>

Shoe prints in the snow led police to the suspect. Around 3:30 this morning, a resident called 911 to report a suspicious person entering an apartment on Forum Drive. When officers arrive at the scene, they noticed a person standing near some vehicles in the parking lot. The person ran from the officers, but was caught a short time later. An investigation reveals several items that were taken form the apartment including computer equipment and kitchen supplies. The shoe prints in the snow matched those of the suspect, Adrin Cruz, 17, of Bend. &nbsp;He was arrested on a Burglary II charge and is held in the Deschutes County Juvenile Department.</p>						</div>

And, he's got a few surprises up his sleeve to thrill the crowd. Of course, the crowning moment will be a visit from Santa. &nbsp;The Parade begins at noon at Harmon and Newport.

They also welcome cash donations. They ask you deliver your gifts, unwrapped to their offices in Bend, Redmond, Madras and Prineville through December 21st.&nbsp;We have a link to the Saving Grace website on our links page.</p>						</div>

And because it just makes sense to do that. I don't think anybody wants to do it any different than what we planned to do. So it's just a question of do we stay on our timeline or not.&quot;&nbsp;Unger says he is reasonably sure that the City will make a decision soon and that the plans for Skyliners overhaul will stay on schedule and budget. He adds that actual construction is slated for 2013.</p>						</div>

Hundreds of people packed into the Tower Theater yesterday for a Memorial service to honor Jason Mitchell. Mitchell, 36, was employed by Bank of the Cascades. CEO Patty Moss says she was proud to know Mitchell.&nbsp;&quot;You know we are proud to have Jason as part of our team.&quot; &nbsp;Moss says Mitchell worked for the bank for 14 years. &nbsp;He started when he was 22 as a teller and most recently was a Senior Commercial Lending Officer.&nbsp;&quot;Jason was really a welcoming - all inclusive.&nbsp;He made more friends and introduced people to each other in a way that expanded his circle of friends everyday.&quot;&nbsp;The service at the Tower Theater was so large that people also filled the Liberty Theater.</p>						</div>

Local Congressman says the proposal would have more credibility if local government supports it.&nbsp;The Bend City Council will be asked to sign a letter of support at tonight's meeting.</p>						</div>
