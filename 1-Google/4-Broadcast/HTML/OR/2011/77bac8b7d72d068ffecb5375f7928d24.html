If you are entertaining guests from those countries, be aware of their presence.&quot;Foot and mouth disease is not a food safety issue, and it does not affect human health, but people can be carriers. &nbsp;Authorities warn you not to bring back vegetables, fruits or plants when traveling outside the country.</p>						</div>

Statistics show the problem is increasing each year. In Oregon, reporting serious mishaps is still voluntary, 32 deaths were attributed to medical mistakes in 2009. Bethany Higgins with the Oregon Patient Safety Commission says her group is working to eliminate the causes:&nbsp;&quot;The great thing about our reporting program is, it extends far beyond just hospitals, so it's across the continuum. We have nursing homes, ambulatory surgery centers. We're even adding pharmacies and renal dialysis. So we're far more reaching that just looking at hospitals.&quot;&nbsp;Higgins says most health providers do report incidents. &nbsp;56 of the states 58 hospitals, 78 percent of nursing homes and more than half of the ambulatory or outpatient surgery centers are reporting serious adverse events to the Commission.</p>						</div>

It has become a very successful testing program because they focus on student learning rather than testing and tests should not be standardized, and measure the progress they have made rather than a compared to a grade level result.&nbsp;&ldquo;For us, it's about growth, not grades.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s about being in a position to predict the future academic growth of a child, and being in a position to find strengths and weaknesses and challenges that the child is going through. So that we can all work on those; including the child, him or herself.&quot;&nbsp;NWEA President Matt Chapman says testing has become much more important in schools, because cash-strapped districts need to decide if a curriculum is working - or not.</p>						</div>

Another one requires proof of citizenship before someone registers to vote for the first time. And another one denies State benefits and licenses to anyone who is not &nbsp;here legally.&nbsp;Another bill would be similar to Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law. &nbsp;Thatcher says her bills have little chance of passing but the discussion is worth having.</p>						</div>

Blumenauer says more and more Americans are supporting the Bill as they see the benefits even if a public option wasn't part of it.&nbsp;He says with repeal not happening, Republicans will instead try to defund several aspects of the Bill. But in his words, he expects hand to hand combat over funding of the bill over the next two years.</p>						</div>

Instead, it may help overweight women drop a few pounds. Doctor Allison Edelman says her team studied Rhesus Macaque monkeys; keeping their diets and activity levels the same while they were on &quot;the pill.&quot; the normal weight monkeys stayed the same.&nbsp;Edelman says weight gain is one of the top reasons women decide to stop taking medications; but the study suggests it's more likely women are gaining weight because of changes in age or lifestyle. The doctor says the study was performed on monkeys because they're bodies are similar to humans, and it is extremely difficult to study weight changes in humans who have differing diet and exercise patterns.</p>						</div>

Governor Kitzhaber spoke to the gathering as well as his new Chief Education Advisor, Nancy Golden.&nbsp;She says there are many groups around the state doing good work and it's time to coordinate efforts. &quot;That's why collaboration's so key. It's looking at what all these separate groups do and saying 'let's make a smooth pathway from cradle to career.' And I think using collaboration, there's a lot more we can do.&quot;&nbsp;The Governor gave some hints about his upcoming budget and told educators to expect cuts. &nbsp;The Oregon Education Association sponsored the symposium as part of an ongoing series of event for improving student success.</p>						</div>

According to Marie Dodds at Triple A, the price of crude oil continues to be the driving force behind the rise. Dodds says there is hope that officials won&rsquo;t let crude get to 2008 prices of about $4.00 a gallon, because they remember what that high price did to the economy in 2008. &nbsp;Right now, the State average translates to about $3.17 a gallon up and down the I-5 corridor in Oregon. Diesel prices are higher too, with an average of $3.42 a gallon. In Bend, you'll pay about $3.10 for a gallon of gas.</p>						</div>

Recent college graduate Laura Baker makes just above minimum wage. She says the extra $20 or so a month really helps:&nbsp;&ldquo;For a salaried person, that may sound a little bit trivial, but for people who are just struggling to make sure they can go buy groceries, twenty bucks is a lot. That can help you buy a bus pass. It can help you buy school supplies for your kids.&quot;&nbsp;Baker says she works two lower paid, part-time jobs and has been unable to find work in her chosen profession. The national employment law project reports so that about 67% of minimum wage earners are women</p>						</div>

There&rsquo;s an annual event that will be celebrating this milestone.&nbsp;It's a combination of excited dogs and excited mushers. &nbsp;The 17th Annual Chemult Sled Dog Races is slated for January 15th and 16th.&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's an event that we have mushers come from several states around to compete against each other with teams of sled dogs. And that could be anywhere from four dogs to eight. And they could run a course starting at only a couple miles up to 16 miles.&quot;&nbsp;Spokesperson Erin Sutton says it's quite a festive atmosphere, with a variety of races for all ages including skijoring.&nbsp;&quot;That&rsquo;s a fun one. That&rsquo;s usually a skier on skis with wither one or two dogs pulling them on a course.&quot;&nbsp;Sutton says races begin at 8:30 each morning and conclude around mid-afternoon at the Walt Haring Sno-park. &nbsp;She says a couple hundred people come just to watch and many ski along side the competitors or snowshoe around the area.

Carlos Quintanilla, with the Oregon Immunization Program, says if you didn't get a vaccination, it's not too late.&nbsp;The shot takes about two weeks to take effect.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Washing your hands several times a day is one way to avoid getting the flu.&nbsp;And he says, if you're sick, stay home. If you have a cough, cover your mouth with you arm or a tissue to avoid spreading the flu.</span></p>						</div>

Oregon Health Science University Pathology Professor, Dr. George Thomas, is excited by the future possibilities of the test that might be able to look at those cancer cells and tell if there are specific mutations And in terms of treatment, if there are specific drugs that target these mutations, then you can perhaps add them into the mix.&nbsp;Four big cancer centers will begin studies on the new test this year. Dr. Thomas says he doesn't know if OHSU will be part of that, but he is excited to see the results.</p>						</div>

Sergeant Pat Shortt says troopers found them just outside the Dalles. &ldquo;What we found was a 2002 black Jeep Cherokee that had rolled over near the west end of the Dalles. The male, Mr. Reed had been ejected from the vehicle and there was a two year old girl in the vehicle.&rdquo;&nbsp;It is alleged that Benjamin Franklin Reed, 31, had kidnapped a mother and daughter from the Portland home they shared and forced her to drive east on I-84, stopping once to rape her. At a second stop the woman got of the car and ran. Mother and daughter are okay.&nbsp;Reed is being held on a million dollars bail.</p>						</div>

House Republican Leader Bruce Hanna thinks Governor-elect Kitzhaber's &quot;Cool Schools&quot; plan is a good idea; hiring local contractors to perform energy saving retrofits on public school buildings and using the cost savings to pay for it. But he would rather see his party's &quot;Main Street Program&quot; get movement.&nbsp;&ldquo;That had to do more with improving people's home and their businesses and the upside to that is that is creates jobs, and it builds property values which in turn create revenue.&rdquo;&nbsp;Both Republican and Democratic leaders agree on the top priorities: job creation and an overhaul of government to reduce spending.</p>						</div>

Jon Lea with the U.S. Department of Agriculture just completed the survey on Mount Hood where there is 91 inches of snow and 30 inches of water.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a good start for the water year again.&nbsp;Lots can still happen, it's early in the season.&nbsp;Typically about 40% of the snow water is on the ground by January first.&rdquo;&nbsp;Lea says farmers hope for a gradual melt this spring. In Washington, the snowpack measurement is at 106% of average.</p>						</div>
