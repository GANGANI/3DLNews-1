The state's 30-year-old policy limits police from cooperating with federal immigration efforts. A number of cities and counties, including Portland, have their own policies promising immigrants protection.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">And that, supporters of such policies say, means immigrants with no criminal record feel comfortable calling law enforcement — even if they’re calling to ask local police to protect them from federal agents.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Trump administration would have you believe something different. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been touring the country warning that <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/jeff-sessions-portland-visit-protest/" target="_blank">sanctuary policies such as Oregon's make communities less safe</a>. He's pushed sanctuary communities to prove their policies don't violate federal law and threatened to withhold federal grants. The Department of Justice <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-justice-department-sues-california-over-immigration-laws/" target="_blank">sued California in early March</a> for its new sanctuary laws, which are similar in intent but more sweeping than Oregon's.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Whatever the crime rate is in a city, you can be sure it would be higher and will be higher if these policies are followed,” Sessions said during a speech in Portland last fall. “Sanctuary policies endanger us all.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Policy experts on both ends of the political spectrum say there’s no data to support that. But the lack of statistical proof hasn’t prevented Sessions and other immigration hardliners from stoking fears.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/VC4GAQZG3VA4HIJ5RQ7YB7HCSI.jpg?auth=b58f20b52392081d8a232ead0ebe98db0a5e3a7c1fa488d3a5cf220cf58f6530&amp;width=150" alt="U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses a room full of federal, state and local law enforcement officials and government employees at the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services field office in Portland Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:2250 / 1500;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses a room full of federal, state and local law enforcement officials and government employees at the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services field office in Portland Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2017.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Bryan M.

Instead, they cite cases such as Sergio Jose Martinez.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Last July, a 65-year-old woman in Northeast Portland woke up in the middle of the night to find Martinez in her bedroom.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He bound her arms and legs with her own socks and scarves. He blindfolded her, gagged her and wrapped a scarf around her mouth.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Then he forced her to perform oral sex and beat her.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Portland Police arrested Martinez within hours of the attack after he physically assaulted another woman while trying to steal her car at knife-point.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In December, Martinez pleaded guilty to assault, robbery and sodomy. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">According to ICE, Martinez <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-sheriff-sergio-martinez-deported-ice-immigrant-portland/" target="_blank">had been deported from and re-entered the United States more than a dozen times</a> before the Portland attacks.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Researchers say Martinez is an extraordinary case. They say there’s no evidence to support the Trump administration’s claims that sanctuary laws create more dangerous communities.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“It’s a rhetorical argument [Sessions is] using, but the facts don’t support him,” said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“When you take a look at the totality of crime research on immigrants in the United States, you find that immigrants are either less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, or about the same,” he said. “And that is a finding that has held since the early 20th Century.”</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/ice-jail-oregon-norcor-josephine-contract-sanctuary-state/">ICE Pays To Use 2 Oregon Jails Despite Sanctuary State Law</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Last March, Nowrasteh <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-reform-bulletin/criminal-immigrants-their-numbers-demographics-countries" target="_blank">co-authored a study</a> that looked at incarceration rates of immigrants in the country illegally compared to native-born Americans.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“We find that they [illegal immigrants] are about half as likely to be incarcerated in prison compared to natives,” he said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The U.S. Department of Justice declined interview requests. The DOJ also didn’t respond to requests for what data or research the agency has to support the attorney general’s claims.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">A DOJ spokesman did write back in an email that said: “The calculation here is pretty simple: If a murderer or rapist is returned to the streets, the community is more at risk than had the criminal alien been turned over to ICE for deportation.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Sessions has pointed to some research in his arguments against sanctuary policies. In July, during a speech in Las Vegas, the attorney general cited a study that he said showed sanctuary cities report more violent crime on average compared to cities that don’t have sanctuary laws.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t,” Sessions said during the July 2017 speech in Las Vegas.</p><div class="article-body--padding article-body-ad"><div class="ad-container f_primary border articleBody

But it also fails to support claims made by some law enforcement agencies that say sanctuary policies make communities safer. Put simply, the study found there is no correlation whatsoever between crime rates and whether a city has some type of sanctuary policy.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Sessions stopped citing the research after Gonzalez O'Brien wrote <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/the-trump-teams-mythology-on-sanctuary-city-crime-rates/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/14/jeff-sessions-used-our-research-to-claim-that-sanctuary-cities-have-more-crime-hes-wrong/" target="_blank">op-eds</a> complaining that the DOJ was misstating his study's findings.</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/oregon-sanctuary-city-state-donald-trump-immigration/">30 Years Later, Oregon&#x27;s &#x27;Sanctuary State&#x27; Law Serves As A Model For Others</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In January, the left-leaning Center for American Progress <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/" target="_blank">published research</a> that found a benefit of sanctuary policies to public safety.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Tom Wong, a professor of political science at the University of California San Diego, wrote in his study that there’s also an economic perk to communities that protect all residents.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Wong used data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement obtained through a public records request. The dataset included 2,494 counties — 608 of which ICE considers sanctuary jurisdictions, according to the study. Using a statistical analysis, Wong matched like counties and incorporated FBI crime data as well as economic details from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/" target="_blank">2015 American Community Survey</a>.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Altogether, the data suggest that when local law enforcement focuses on keeping communities safe, rather than becoming entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts, communities are safer and community members stay more engaged in the local economy,” Wong wrote.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Absent data and research that bolster its case, the Trump administration points to individual crimes, such as the Martinez case in Portland or the <a href="https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/18799/explainer-what-are-sanctuary-cities" target="_blank">case of Kate Steinle in San Francisco</a>.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In 2015, Steinle was shot and killed while walking along the Embarcadero.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Jose Inez Garcia Zarate, who is in the country illegally, was charged with the 32-year-old woman's death. His attorneys argued he didn't intend to kill Steinle, <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11633296/steinle-trial-verdict" target="_blank">rather Zarate found something wrapped in a shirt</a> on the pier that turned out to be a gun. The weapon discharged after Zarate picked it up. During trial, the defense called experts who said the shooting was accidental, noting that the bullet Zarate shot ricocheted before hitting Steinle in the back. In December, <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-immigrant-acquitted-of-san-francisco-killing-sentenced-on-lesser-gun-charge/" target="_blank">a jury acquitted Zarate of murder</a>.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">President Trump has cited the Steinle case repeatedly, during the campaign and since taking office, in arguing for tougher immigration enforcement.

The second time was to ask what was taking police officers so long.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lourdes said she handed her baby to her husband in an effort to stop agents who were trying to lead him away.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“I give her to my husband so they couldn’t take him,” she said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the 911 call, Lourdes told the dispatcher that an ICE officer was trying to take the baby out of her husband’s arms.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Tell them to hurry up, because they want to touch my daughter, and I told them I don’t want them to touch my daughter,” Lourdes said on the call, according to audio obtained through a public records request.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Who wants to touch your daughter?” the dispatcher responded.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“The ICE—” she said, before being interrupted by the dispatcher.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the background of the 911 call, a baby cried.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">A spokeswoman for ICE said she couldn’t confirm the incident and also couldn’t speak to the specific actions of individual agents.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter other aliens illegally present in the United States,” the spokeswoman said in a follow-up email. “These aliens are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and, when appropriate, they are arrested by ICE officers.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lourdes later said that when she called the police, the only thing she was thinking about was her daughter’s safety.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“I trust the police,” she said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">That’s important to Jim Ferraris, who has been chief of the Woodburn Police Department since December 2015.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The city of about 30,000 is arguably the most diverse in Oregon with a population that’s 65 percent Latino, 10 percent Russian, with a growing number of Somali residents and a community of mostly white retirees centered around a golf course.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Even before Trump took office, Ferraris said, he’s made improving relations between the police and immigrant populations a priority.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“As I moved around the community to become acquainted, I heard very clearly that there was a sense of fear with law enforcement, that often times local law enforcement was confused with federal immigration authorities,” Ferraris said. “It’s no secret that it’s very likely that some of our Latino population is undocumented.
