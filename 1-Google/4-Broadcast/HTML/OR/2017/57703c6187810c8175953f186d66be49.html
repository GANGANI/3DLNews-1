      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I was born in Eugene, but I have spent most of my life here in Grants Pass. In fact, my great-grandparents and grandmother first moved here in 1911 and my children will be 4th-generation graduates of Grants Pass High School -- I graduated from GPHS in 1981. I graduated from the University of Oregon in 1986 with a degree in Broadcast Journalism, which paved the way for my first stint at KAJO/KLDR from 1996-2004. After temporarily leaving this job, I earned a Master's Degree in Teaching from Southern Oregon University in 2006. I taught elementary school locally for several years, but returned to the radio business in 2012. In July of 2015, I was offered the opportunity to return to KAJO/KLDR/KRRM as News Director and I quickly accepted. I have a wonderful wife, Shelly, and three great kids - Jane, Jackson and Louisa - plus many family members and friends in Southern Oregon. I feel blessed for many reasons and I'm extremely happy to play an important role in this community with the Grants Pass Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I was born in Kansas and raised in Nebraska. In 1966, I enlisted in the Army. During the first year I traveled coast to coast and border to border. Then I was banished (reassigned) to Alaska. I couldn't sleep because the sun refused to set, it rained for forty days and nights, there were earthquakes, and mosquitos. I came to love it so much, after the first year, that I stayed for eighteen more. While there I married and soon had a newborn daughter. We brought her closer to her grandparents by moving to Grants Pass in 1986; I also found gainful employment. I quit that job to join the KAJO staff and take advantage of my twenty years of broadcast experience. I am still here.</p>

We have four boys (Jacob, Ethan, Ryne and Nevin). When I'm not spending time interacting with our staff or one of our clients, you'll most likely find me with my pride and joy, MY BOYS!</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I am avid sports fan. I enjoy watching and studying how the games are played. I love coaching my boy’s baseball teams and spending time with family and friends.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I have worn a couple different hats here at the station. I started as an Advertising Consultant, then became the Sales Manager, dabbled as the Promotions Director, and am now the General Manager. I have loved building relationships with people and businesses in our community. I really have enjoyed leading our team/family here at the station. We take pride in finding ways to be more involved with our community on a daily basis.</p>

      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I wasn't born in Grants Pass, but I might as well have been. My family moved to Grants Pass when I was three months old. I graduated from Grants Pass High School and am still here (and going strong) with my husband and three daughters.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I love to go camping, fishing, and entertaining friends with my amazing barbecue. And you will never find me without at least one Pearl Jam album in my car. My life never lends itself to a dull moment-you know what they say, “No rest for the wicked!”</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I do a few different things here at the station. In addition to my time on the air at KLDR, I also lend my voice to many of the commercials you hear. Air time is always fun, but my favorite thing I do is being your friendly radio sales consultant who loves to put more money in the pockets of our local businesses. I feel working with our great list of advertisers and bringing new ones to the air waves is one of the most rewarding things I do. I am the daughter of local business owners, as well as the wife of a business owner. I have great empathy towards the struggles that face employers these days. This lends me to be a great advocate of your business and the creative ways we can use radio to have steady and strong growth.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I love my family, my community, and the Lord. I can truly say I enjoy my job!</p>

      <h4 class="staff-title">CEO</h4>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">Since my father, Jim Wilson, founded KAJO in 1957, you could say that I literally was "raised on radio". My first memories are of going to visit my dad when he was behind the mic at KLAD in Klamath Falls, OR. We moved to Grants Pass when I was five and shortly thereafter, dad founded the venerable `ol AM 1270. My heroes have always been DJ's... and I am fortunate to have known every announcer who has ever been on KAJO in its entire history, dating from the summer of `57. It is an honor to be counted in that crew... and, have we ever seen some interesting guys and gals during that time! I made my on-air debut in the summer of `68. For the most part, I've been on the air continually since that time... with a couple of partial detours. I joined the navy right after high school and spent two years active duty and a bunch of years in reserve. Another very interesting detour was an appointment to the Oregon State Legislature in 1998 and two subsequent reelections. I took a hiatus at the end of 2002 and returned to the family business. Radio is SO much fun... One highlight of my career was going through the process of adding KLDR to the fold back in 1991 and getting an opportunity to do contemporary radio on FM as a morning jock. Those were heady years indeed! In 2014 I again felt the call to return to the State Legislature and have been serving proudly as a right minded voice for Southern Oregon ever since.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I am married to Malinda and have been since summer of `72, and we have two adult children, J.L. and Lora. J.L. is the owner of a longtime lobbying and public affairs firm in Salem, Public Affairs Counsel. Lora is a marriage and family therapist with a practice in Salem. They are both married to great people... J.L.'s wife is Heather... and Lora's husband, Greg. We also have grandchildren Abigail, Ruby, and Ava Wilson, Tyler Johns, Ashlynn and Johnny Withers and Samson Goodenough.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">My hobby is motorcycles. I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of miles I have ridden since the summer of `68, but it has been too many to count. My old Harley and I are slowing down and I am happy to be getting interested in travel trailers. Malinda and I have really enjoyed this hobby over the last several years and there is more to come, I trust! Malinda and I are very active in the ministry at River Valley Church and enjoy having our bibles close at hand. We don't just carry them, we believe them. Life without Jesus Christ would be useless to me.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">Again, thank you for your interest in our stations. Our desire is to be a "city on a hill" in our community. Please let us know if we can do more to serve you. Thank you!</p>

      <h4 class="staff-title">Public Service Director</h4>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I began working for KAJO on March 18, 1991 at the front desk (and part-time no less). In late 1992 Jim Wilson, aka "Big Jim", saw something special in me and we spent a few months training together. It’s a very cool story; ask me about it sometime!</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">When KAJO decided to move Rush over to the AM side of things that left a three hour hole on the FM side; That would become mine. I signed-on to KLDR for the first time at 9am on July 4, 1993. I was on-air for three hours a day, but because ratings were always excellent I was given more and more time. Eventually I was on 9am to 2pm, my title was “Lady of the Mid-Day” and I loved every minute of it!</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I came to Grants Pass Broadcasting at a time when KAJO was signing off at sunset and KLDR did not exist. We were playing records on a record player, commercials were recorded on Carts (Similar to 8-Track Tapes) and played back on Cart-Machine’s, Reel-to-Reels were still being used, the daily log was printed on paper, and music-hopefuls came via mail. All audio is delivered digitally via computer and the computers in our studios are all touch screen. I watched as we transitioned from records to CD’s and now all of our music is on the hard drive of a computer and I never touch a CD.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I have held many hats here and had many responsibilities including Accounts Payable, Copy Writing, and audio editor. I held the title of News Director from 2004 to 2006 and Program Director for both stations from 2010 to late 2015. I am currently the Public Service Director for both stations. I'm also on-air, which honestly is the best part of my job. ;0) I call this “my God-job” and give Him all the praise, honor, and credit because it was He who led me to the door back in March of 1991. Another story I would love to share with you.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I love what I do! This has been and continues to be such an amazing journey. You will find me on KAJO from 9AM to 1PM each weekday and KLDR from 2pM to 6PM at the front desk in the middle.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">In my spare time, I enjoy cooking healthy food; I enjoy a good movie and like to work in my yard. I love to laugh and I love Josephine County and Grants Pass.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I lead worship music at my church and I am currently raising a granddaughter. She and I have taken square dance lessons and painting classes. She loves to just get in the car and drive; as do I. I can’t forget Wendell Stark who is a huge part of my life again and my biggest fan! We met in January of 1984 and I wouldn’t want to go through life without him.</p>

      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I grew up in Eugene, where I developed a real passion for music and radio at a very young age. By the time I was 10, I was listening mostly to stations from Portland, and was inspired by some great talents.  I wanted to learn everything I could about the radio business, knowing this was what I wanted to spend my life doing.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">In high school, I was a student announcer at KRVM, and received my first paycheck from KDUK at age 17. I then spent 14 years working for KKNU/KMGE, and later, KEUG. As a side project, through the internet, I programmed the high school radio station in Oakridge from 1999 to 2010.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">Over the years, I had an interest in KLDR, as I would always listen while traveling through Southern Oregon. I thought this would be the perfect station for me to get involved with.  I made the move to Grants Pass in September 2011, to join the awesome KLDR team. It was the best move I could have made!  In addition to my time on the air, I'm honored to manage the production and music programming department for the company.</p>
      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">In 2018, I finally met and married the love of my life; the beautiful Nikko.  Together, we enjoy the laid-back Southern Oregon lifestyle.  I certainly have been blessed, and am very grateful!</p>

      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">The magic of radio captured me during my campaign for Commissioner. I sat down with Chuck Benson for an interview in the KAJO studio and was instantly hooked. There was just something about the atmosphere that appealed to me. After my campaign ended, I sat down with Carl Wilson and asked the burning question on my mind, “How does one get started in radio?” He graciously gave me the opportunity to begin training with himself and Marty, and here I am. I started out running the sports board for Cavemen and Duck games in September of 2016. After some months of training, I began on-air work in February of 2017. I joined the team full time in August of 2018. Connecting with the community in this way has been very rewarding. It’s been an incredibly fun experience and I anticipate and look forward to being on the air for years to come!
When not doing radio, you’ll find me at a community event or spending time with family and friends.
Thanks for listening to KAJO and KLDR!

      <p class="paragraph announcer-bio">I was born and raised in the Eugene/Springfield area. When high school and college came around, I made my way up to Washington in Spangle (Upper Columbia Academy), and College Place (Walla Walla University). Once I got to college, I applied for the on-campus radio station. Friends, family, and total strangers had often told me I had a voice (and probably a face) for radio, so I wanted to give it a shot. Long story short, I didn't make it in (But feel free to ask. It's a funny story in hindsight). Anyway, after I graduated with a degree in Communications, I moved to Glendale and joined the Top Hat Theatre Company for about two years. I learned about KLDR and KAJO through a friend of mine and even had it recommended to me at Grocery Outlet while I was out job hunting. After my previous radio experience I was a little nervous to try it again, but man a' livin" I'm glad I walked through those front doors! I absolutely loved the environment and the people working there. I felt like this was where God wanted me to be. It has been a little over two years now and I'm still loving it! Thank you all for bearing with me on KAJO, KLDR, and KRRM! It has been a hoot and a half and I'm looking forward to the coming years!</p>
