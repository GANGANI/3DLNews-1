							<p>BEND, OR -- The Bend Metropolitan Planning Organization will apply for $1.2 million from the federal government&rsquo;s Carbon Reduction funding program.</p>

<p>ODOT is in charge of awarding grants for transportation solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>MPO manager Tyler Deke says they will get an overview of the program, application process, and projects that could meet ODOT requirements at a meeting next week. &ldquo;Things they [ODOT) will be looking for are the climate benefits of the projects in terms of the projects ability to reduce carbon emissions, and then for local support, equity, opportunities and innovations, and the project readiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As part of the MPO, the City of Bend, Deschutes County, and Cascades East Transit, and other jurisdictions, are looking at an array of projects that would be the best use of the grant money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The city of Bend right now is working on a pedestrian implementation plan. And so, if the funding were to go towards sidewalk construction it would go quite a way, but if it goes toward a bigger transit type of project it would go less far in the sense that it would only go to implementing a couple of those types of projects,&rdquo; explains Deke adding that every idea is on the table at this initial gathering, &ldquo;What we want to do is just meet with all of our partners and see what types of projects they could potentially implement within the timeline of these funds being available over the next 2 or 3 years. And then having a discussion with everybody as to how to go about prioritizing our application from this area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The public meeting is Wednesday morning, January 4th at Bend City Hall.</p>

						<div class="entry-content">
							<p>BEND, OR -- Winter is really just getting started, but Deschutes County Search and Rescue has already had a busy season. &ldquo;So far, calendar year 2022, we&rsquo;ve had about 16 winter-related rescues,&quot; says DCSO Emergency Manager Sgt. Nathan Garibay, &quot;And, the number one category is stuck or stranded motorists.&quot;&nbsp;Deschutes County Search and Rescue is one of the most active SARs in the state.</p>

<p>Garibay&nbsp;says drivers typically get stuck on less-traveled roads, &ldquo;We get a number of people that they&rsquo;re following Google maps, or they&rsquo;ll go out China Hat Road and try to go to Fort Rock, or out Findley Butte Road, or they&rsquo;ll come in from the Fort Rock side, or they&rsquo;ll take Forest Service 41, which is Conklin Road, just west of the river that goes from Century Drive down to Sunriver. And those roads aren&rsquo;t maintained for winter travel. They&rsquo;ll get to a point where they can&rsquo;t turn around and so they keep going, and then they just get themselves really stuck.&rdquo; He tells KBND News,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes that can lead to some expensive vehicle recovery fees, as well, for those folks. Typically, we can&rsquo;t recover their vehicle for them, so they&rsquo;re likely going to be paying someone to do it.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>He advises drivers, &ldquo;Know before you go, do your research as far as what the conditions are going to be like, make sure that you take those best practices; travel with a partner if possible, don&rsquo;t go beyond your level of expertise or ability, make sure that you take proper equipment and gear.&rdquo;</span></p>

State Police Captain&nbsp;Kyle Kennedy tells KBND News,&nbsp;"We make it a priority on our holiday weekends to make sure we put out the best presence we can."</span><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-843fb8f8-7fff-1ea1-4f9b-f5730c3247b7">This weekend will be extra busy&nbsp;with holiday travelers returning home and football fans gathering to watch big&nbsp;games,&nbsp;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-843fb8f8-7fff-1ea1-4f9b-f5730c3247b7">"The college playoff games are going to be on Saturday, we&rsquo;re coming into the last week of the NFL season and this is when people&rsquo;s teams are playing their games. And, we want people to get together and have a good time with family," says Capt.

It all combines for an increased risk on the road, "They partake in consuming alcohol and staying up late, and that leads us into seeing an increase, really, in DUIs, impaired driving, distracted driving, drowsy driving."</span></p><p>Kennedy says time of day changes what Troopers&nbsp;look&nbsp;for. At night, it's drunk and high drivers. But during the day, especially on such a busy weekend, he says driver distraction can be a big problem,&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-843fb8f8-7fff-1ea1-4f9b-f5730c3247b7">"The law prohibits you from being on your electronic device, but there&rsquo;s other things in your vehicle that can be a significant distraction, including conversations, reading through something, checking your mail - like your physical mail that you picked up. Those are all things that take our eyes off the road and then reduce our ability to react when something happens in front of us."</span></p><p>Kennedy has one main&nbsp;message for drivers this weekend:&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-843fb8f8-7fff-1ea1-4f9b-f5730c3247b7">"Please use speed that&rsquo;s appropriate for the conditions."

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-afd4778f-7fff-2e15-08dd-eb61d3ecc768">After a year of changes for the Bend City Council, Mayor-Elect Melanie Kebler hopes 2023 will bring positive steps forward.&nbsp;Kebler will be sworn in Wednesday and says she&rsquo;s ready to lead, "I really have already been talking to fellow Councilors, incoming and current, about how I want to build us up as a team so that we work really well together, that everyone feels comfortable and safe to converse and discuss issues, to disagree, to really make the best policy we can, as a team."</span><p><span>When Kebler takes over January fourth, she'll be the third woman in seven months to hold the position. In May 2022, City Council saw&nbsp;the <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/633163">sudden resignation of the Mayor</a> and <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/634764">a Councilor</a>. It brought "</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-09492f2b-7fff-ed80-3801-5338798d9e1c">Some disappointment, some surprise, some sadness," says Kebler,&nbsp;"But, I think as a team, the Council moved through it very well."&nbsp;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-bb0bd2c1-7fff-c1dc-86cb-8de9095f0d43">Kebler attributes that transition to rules updated earlier in the year, establishing a process for appointing successors mid-term. Councilor Gena Goodman-Campbell was later appointed to replace Sally Russell as Mayor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-afd4778f-7fff-2e15-08dd-eb61d3ecc768">Kebler admits, "I definitely probably have a different leadership style than we&rsquo;ve seen from Mayors in the past." She says she wants to foster a spirit of collaboration. But Council faced criticism recently, after approving&nbsp;the </span><a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/665848">home energy score program</a> amid complaints&nbsp;from some in real estate that their concerns weren&rsquo;t considered.&nbsp;Kebler says that&rsquo;s not true, "<span id="docs-internal-guid-afd4778f-7fff-2e15-08dd-eb61d3ecc768">That just sort of pre-supposes that it&rsquo;s very black and white - it&rsquo;s either yes or no on every question that comes in front of us. And, it&rsquo;s actually a lot more complicated than that. There&rsquo;s a lot of different ways we can do policy work that takes into account the concerns on any side of an issue. "</span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-afd4778f-7fff-2e15-08dd-eb61d3ecc768">She tells KBND News housing, transportation and long-range planning are top priorities for the year ahead, "And working through what I expect to be the <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/lcd/CL/Pages/CFEC.aspx">Climate-Friendly and Equitable Communities</a> rules that we&rsquo;re going to be working with, after they move through the legal process. All of that is going to be a huge task for us and for city staff to really just keep thinking about not just taking care of projects short term, but how we plan for Bend&rsquo;s future in the long term and make sure that we grow in a sustainable way; that we don&rsquo;t lose the spirit of our city." Kebler adds, "The other thing I want to do as Mayor is really be out in community a lot, maybe more than Mayors have in the past, just showing up in a lot of different places with a lot of different groups that maybe don&rsquo;t regularly come in front of Council."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-afd4778f-7fff-2e15-08dd-eb61d3ecc768">With new Mayors also in Redmond, Madras and Culver, Kebler believes Bend will continue to collaborate with cities around the region.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-ecb237c8-7fff-b074-a7ad-a1a99447527f">A multi agency effort to clean up encampments near Hunnell Road in Bend will soon get underway, in preparation for road construction.&nbsp;Cheyenne Purrington, Director of the Coordinated Houseless Response Office, says this will be the first use of the Encampment Resolution Pilot Project, modeled after successful efforts in other cities, "We&rsquo;re really focused on providing a framework that ensures services are provided to individuals who are in locations&nbsp;slated for displacement." She adds, "Our hope is that through this process, we&rsquo;re able to provide services, shelter options and hopefully housing navigation." Purrington tells KBND News the three-month effort will also help regional agencies practice partnerships and learn how to better address gaps in the system before Encampment Resolution is used elsewhere in Central Oregon.</span><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ecb237c8-7fff-b074-a7ad-a1a99447527f">City officials have declared the Hunnell Road area, from Cooley Road to the dead end,&nbsp;an &ldquo;unsafe campsite&rdquo; and plan&nbsp;to clear the area by March prior to work on the <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/658056">North Corridor Improvement Project</a>. According to the city, police responded to 218 calls for service&nbsp;between August 15 and November 15 of this year, resulting in 43 criminal cases and 33 arrests.</span>&nbsp;"<span id="docs-internal-guid-ecb237c8-7fff-b074-a7ad-a1a99447527f">It&rsquo;s already unsafe, just by being on the public right-of-way. Large encampments, we know, see higher calls for service, more hospitalizations, more incidents of violence," says Purrington,&nbsp;"But then, with heavy equipment going up and down the road, it would actually pose a threat to life, even more significantly."</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-ecb237c8-7fff-b074-a7ad-a1a99447527f">Purrington's office and Deschutes County Behavioral Health will work with other service providers to offer case management and help campers relocate.&nbsp;"We will essentially stand up an incident response. So the idea is to surge services and provide intensive case management, and meet people&rsquo;s needs." But&nbsp;those needs vary, "I&rsquo;ve personally spoken with a number of folks out there and they&rsquo;ve identified that they already have a plan in place and just need support to implement that; and that&rsquo;s often the case."&nbsp;She says the city may take other action, such as opening rooms at the Rainbow Motel.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ecb237c8-7fff-b074-a7ad-a1a99447527f">Recent counts show around 65 campsites in that area now, down from a high of 100.&nbsp;Once the camps are cleared, the city will conduct final cleanup at the site before construction begins on North Highway 97.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

							<p>SISTERS, OR --&nbsp;A Sisters man,&nbsp;<a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/662138">arrested last month for drug trafficking</a>, is now a suspect in a series of construction and heavy equipment thefts &nbsp;in the Portland metro area. Investigators believe 46-year-old Paul Weston stole dump trailers, a car trailer, side-by-side ATVs, a skid steer loader, bucket loader and a tractor from various locations in Portland and Vancouver over a two-month period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They say he then brought the equipment to his home on Peterson Ridge Road in Sisters, obliterated serial numbers and tried to sell it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When detectives re-arrested Weston Wednesday, they recovered equipment valued at about $225,000. Authorities were able to match all but three dump trailers and a skid steer loader to victims. Anyone with information about the unclaimed property is urged to contact Det. Jeff Pope at 541-388-6655, referencing case number 22-69589.</p>

<p>Detectives say they also seized a commercial quantity of fake pills made of fentanyl at the time of his arrest. Weston is charged with Aggravated Theft, Possession of Stolen Vehicle, Trafficking in Vehicles with Destroyed or Altered Identification Numbers, Unlawful Use of a Motor Vehicle and Unlawful Possession of Fentanyl.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Central Oregon Community College&rsquo;s 15th annual&nbsp;Season of Nonviolence starts next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COCC&rsquo;S Christy Walker says the award-winning young adult novel &lsquo;This Is My America&rsquo;, by University of Oregon Vice Provost Kim Johnson is not typical for this event, &ldquo;We tend to use more academic type of books in these reading groups, and we thought that having a book of this nature that is a powerful fiction story, would hopefully inspire and invite a diverse group of people to join these book groups.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along with the book discussions throughout Central Oregon there are live performances, community conversations, and a pair of distinguished keynote speakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so excited to bring in&nbsp;Ilyasah Shabazz and&nbsp;Ndaba Mandela, who are respectively Malcolm X&rsquo;s daughter and Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s grandson. They&rsquo;re doing a joint conversation talk at the Tower Theater on January 26<sup>th</sup>,&rdquo; says Walker.</p>

<p>COCC&rsquo;s Season of Nonviolence book group discussions start January 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and run through mid-March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is our 15th year hosting the Season of Nonviolence. Traditionally it honors Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Martin Luther King, and here at COCC we also add Chief Wilma Mankiller and C&eacute;sar Ch&aacute;vez as folks that we look up to that inspire us through peaceful activism and education,&rdquo; Walker explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That system is more individual-based. They focus on one grade level per week, and they have this team of multi-disciplinary experts from the school district who come in, and that could be teachers, principals and counselors, and they kind of get this holistic view of all the things that a student might be dealing with,&rdquo; says Redmond School&rsquo;s Holly Brown, &ldquo;Then they can really take a look at what might be affecting that student in school and out of school, and then they work with that student&rsquo;s family really closely to try to come up with a plan of how can we get them up to where we kind of expect them to be amongst their peers. They have a lot more resources now that are interactive, and they can use online and textbook resources. We try to keep things interesting in the schools for the students.&rdquo;</p>

A large section of Highway 26 was closed for about three hours.</span></p><p><span>On the west end of Highway 26, near the coast, three people from Seaside were killed when a large tree fell on the cab of an F-150 pickup. That incident occurred at about 11:40 a.m. near milepost 15 and closed the highway for five hours on Tuesday. The 19-year-old driver and his passengers, aged 41 and four, were all found dead when first responders arrived.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Weather-related power outages continued into Wednesday morning from Portland to Medford and along the coast.

							<p>BEND, OR -- Fentanyl use in Central Oregon has sky-rocketed.&nbsp;Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel says fighting that drug problem will be a main challenge for long-serving Chief Deputy Steve Gunnels, who takes over as DA next week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tragic issue with illicit fentanyl is it gets its way into other drugs, or sometimes there&rsquo;s too much drug in a pill. If you&rsquo;re buying it on the street, it might have 10 times the quantity, so you just think you&rsquo;re taking one pill to get a buzz and you&rsquo;re dead from an overdose,&rdquo; says Hummel, who&nbsp;believes the county&rsquo;s population growth is responsible for the rise in illegal drug use, along with the DA&rsquo;s office handling more cases of theft, and impaired driving arrests.</p>

<p>Hummel tells KBND News the drug is so dangerous because users can&rsquo;t be sure what quantity they are ingesting, &ldquo;A kid might think &lsquo;well I&rsquo;m taking this opiate pill, I&rsquo;ll take it like a pain pill, maybe it gives me a buzz&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;re dead from an overdose. So, we see unintentional overdose deaths from fentanyl are rising and we need to get a handle on that. And so that&rsquo;s going to be a big challenge for Steve, local law enforcement, and local treatment providers to try to get a handle on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunnels will be sworn in along with other newly-elected Deschutes County officials on Tuesday, January 3rd.</p>

The American Welding Society (AWS) grant will allow students to earn an Entry Level Welder certification while still in high school. </span></p>

<p><span>Instructor&nbsp;Chuck Hill said in a statment, &quot;We are really excited since this will allow us to provide our students hands-on experience with the tools and equipment that are being used in the workplace right now &ndash; and &ndash; create a pipeline for local businesses who desperately need these trade professionals.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The funds were provided through the AWS Foundation as part of a nationally competitive process and will allow the school to purchase a multiple-operator SMAW power supply, a mechanized oxy-fuel torch, another torch and related equipment for carbon-arc gouging, and FCAW equipment for existing GMAW machines.&nbsp;The new equipment should be purchased and installed by next fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the need for skilled welders continues to increase, helping educational facilities at the high school and college level is more important than ever,&rdquo; said Monica Pfarr, Executive Director of the AWS Foundation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are pleased to support the expansion of the Bend High School welding program, their commitment to the welding industry and their&nbsp;dedication to cultivating the next generation of welding technicians and professionals.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commissioner Tony Debone says one issue is finding places to build homes within State Land Use guidelines, &ldquo;The motivation of having a parcel with a little bit of elbow room; that&rsquo;s something we can add to this equation, too. And I&rsquo;m not talking urban sprawl from everywhere in Central Oregon, but just some opportunities for a little bit of land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After presenting the survey&rsquo;s results and conclusions, Chamber CEO Katy Brooks asked the Commissioners for their cooperation. &ldquo;This is a bigger problem than individual employers are able to handle. And this is where we all get together from the private, public standpoint of trying to figure out some solutions, policy-wise and strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commissioners unanimously agreed to work with the Chamber and its partners. The next steps are to advocate with local government to take plans to the state legislature.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Central Oregon in for another blast of winter weather, starting tonight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With temperatures predicted to dip into the single digits in some areas, ODOT&rsquo;s Kasey Davey urges drivers to take appropriate precautions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For folks who are driving on the road, expect anything that looks just wet is not wet, it&rsquo;s going to be ice. Because everything is going to be completely frozen when we get that low. So, make sure you&rsquo;re slowing down, and giving yourself extra time and extra stopping distance when you&rsquo;re out there on the roads,&rdquo; said Davey, who reminds&nbsp;drivers that they need to be prepared for slick conditions because magnesium chloride used to pre-treat and de-ice roads isn&rsquo;t as effective, &ldquo;It works down to the upper teens pretty well. In mid- to lower-teens it works, but it&rsquo;s very slow and can start to be a little bit slow. When we&rsquo;re getting down into the low single digits, that tool by itself is probably not going to work. So, we&rsquo;ll be using more of the cinders and plowing, and hoping that folks are driving safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Local road construction shouldn&rsquo;t add to the stress, according to Davey, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to continue seeing one-lane closures on US-20 through the New Year. And the south leg of Old Bend Redmond [Highway] is still closed while they&rsquo;re working on that. But, during the holiday weekend; so, that means starting this Thursday through Tuesday, and the same New Year&rsquo;s weekend, there won&rsquo;t be any construction going on, and most of the single-lane closures should be picked up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This cold front is already impacting other parts of the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Snow canceled flights out of Seattle Tuesday, and ice is believed to be the cause of a fatal crash that shut down I-84 outside Troutdale.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Shepherd&#39;s House is asking for donations to help the houseless community. With a surge in below-normal temperatures, the nonprofit says cold weahter supplies are greatly diminished.</p>

<p>Shepherd&#39;s House needs blankets, hats, gloves, socks, hand warmers, coffee creamer and hot chocolate packets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/667216">Bend Shelters Operating At Capacity In Early Winter</a></strong></p>

<p>Donations can be dropped off at the Lighthouse Navigation Center, at 275 NE 2nd St. in Bend, between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. Click <a href="https://shepherdshouseministries.org/">HERE</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Shepherd&#39;s House Redmond warming shelter will open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday, when highs are predicted to only reach the teens. The Redmond facility is inside Mountain View Fellowship Church, at 1475 SW 35th St. It&#39;s typically only open overnight, 6 p.m. to 7 a.m.</p>

<p>Redmond City Director Andrew Hoeksema said in a statement, &ldquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s House is committed to caring for the most vulnerable people in our community. Extreme winter weather like this makes us think of specific names and faces we worry about being outdoors in the cold, so we will open for daytime warming. As many of us in Central Oregon enjoy the holiday season, our unhoused neighbors are at significant risk on these frigid days. We will partner with Redmond community members to welcome them inside, offering simple food and safety to care for those who need it most.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

							<p>PRINEVILLE, OR -- A U.S. Forest Service proposal to build up to 52 miles of trails in Lemon Gulch, northeast of Prineville, is drawing <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/630450">more criticism</a> from some in the area.</p>

<p>Crook County Judge Seth Crawford and the other Commissioners sent an <a href="https://co.crook.or.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/county_administration/page/14146/letter_-_forest_service_-_lemon_gulch.pdf">11-page letter</a> on Monday, expressing concern with how the plan was developed. &ldquo;We believe that there could&rsquo;ve been a lot more outreach to the permittee holders, the neighbors. I think the other aspect of it is, there&rsquo;s quite a few things we&rsquo;ve found that don&rsquo;t match up with the Forest Service&rsquo;s own plan,&rdquo; Crawford told KBND News.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I think is most important is that the Forest Service looks at a holistic forest-wide view of what they want to do for non-motorized trail use before they start putting these projects in different areas. Ensure that what they are proposing is in concert with their own Forest plan. And then, on top of that, I think that it&rsquo;s extremely important that they work to take input from the entire public, not just certain groups,&rdquo; Crawford added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 700 people submitted feedback prior to the public comment deadline, which was midnight on Monday the 19<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trails would be primarily developed for mountain bikes. The plan has not been finalized, and the Forest Service could decide to not move it forward.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- The&nbsp;High Desert Food and Farm Alliance&nbsp;is looking for businesses to join the High Desert Food Trail. This self-guided trail showcasing offerings from Central Oregon farmers, ranchers, brewers and chefs is in its second year, after a successful launch in October of 2021.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spoke to a lot of folks that were really interested. They were looking for a way to find local food, similar to the fruit loop up in the gorge. That they could follow and go on their own pace, so it was really exciting to be able to share this opportunity with them,&rdquo; Agricultural Services Manager Andrea Smith says businesses offering local products can be a part of the High Desert Food Trail.</p>

<p>Smith tells KBND News the Trail partners with Travel Oregon and Visit Central Oregon to&nbsp;help promote the program, &ldquo;Last year we marketed through a couple of different avenues. In this next year we will be pushing a couple of different and unique ways of marketing. &hellip;Doing potentially videos that we can share, or more marketing materials in our local outlets&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a visiting foodie or a local looking for something fresh and new, the High Desert Food Trail offers everyone the opportunity to find out where our food comes from. &ldquo;Any kind of business that has a certain level of local food that they either produce or sell in their business is welcome to be a part of the food trail. So, that can be anything from a cider company to a ranch that has events on their farm,&rdquo; says Smith.</p>

<p>The deadline to apply is December 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>

Shepherd&rsquo;s House Emergency Services Director John Lodise says The Lighthouse Center in Bend opens&nbsp;additional space in the day-use area to get more people inside overnight, when its 110 beds fill up. "</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-d68113f2-7fff-e10d-1de0-af2f81533c40">We don&rsquo;t want people to be out in the cold and risk their lives in what can be sometimes deadly cold weather. So, we want to do whatever we can to bring people inside and keep them safe," Lodise said.&nbsp;</span><span>"So, the other night, we had 138 people total in the building here, and we had 28 people in the building in Redmond," he told KBND News Friday, "So that&rsquo;s 166 people that we were putting up."</span><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d68113f2-7fff-e10d-1de0-af2f81533c40">Gwenn Wysling, Executive Director of the Bethlehem Inn, says their Bend shelter is full, with new people moving in as soon as others move out, "That capacity is an ebb and flow. Roughly, we&rsquo;ve served 166 people in the last month."

So, we have peak capacity in the summertime, as well."</span>&nbsp;But, she adds,<span>&nbsp;"This time of year, it seems a little more demanding because the weather is so harsh and it is so cold. And there are not a whole lot of alternatives if you don&rsquo;t have a place to stay."</span></p><p>Lodise says Shepherd's House sees a similar trend,&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-d68113f2-7fff-e10d-1de0-af2f81533c40">"We&rsquo;ve been at 110 beds, here at the Lighthouse, for the last three months, even when it was warmer. That&rsquo;s more directly related to more and more people who are on the streets or camping, seem to be making a choice that they want to move on from that."&nbsp;The Shepherd&rsquo;s House shower truck is also serving about 95 people a week in various camps.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-d68113f2-7fff-e10d-1de0-af2f81533c40">Both nonprofits operate shelters in Redmond.

KBND Outdoor Expert Gary Lewis says the competitions help protect young livestock from the predators, "It is good for wildlife conservation because, not only do we want those beef calves to grow up, but we want the baby antelope to survive. And, we want to keep the coyote numbers in balance where they need to be, not out of proportion."

							<p>TUMALO, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-cc348e56-7fff-b9b6-2e6c-745b05955ade">One cat is dead and two others missing, following a Sunday afternoon fire in Tumalo. Fire crews responded to the 960-square foot single-wide at about 12:15 p.m. They were on-scene within nine minutes, but had trouble putting out the fire due to the significant amount of combustible material inside.</span></p>

<p><span>The homeowner told Bend Fire crews the pipes had frozen inside the 1968 manufactured home, so he used a heat gun at the back of the house to try and thaw them. Heat conducted along a metal pipe and ignited combustibles inside. Flames spread quickly through the ceiling, to the roof. </span></p>

<p><span>The home was a total loss and the Red Cross is helping the three people who lived there. They did not have insurance. </span></p>

<p>Recent cold weathercaused several frozen water pipes throughout the area. Bend Fire &amp; Rescue encourages everyone to take steps to prevent frozen domestic and fire sprinkler lines by ensuring buildings are adequately insulated, especially attic and crawlspace areas that could have very low temperatures.&nbsp;Insulating crawl space vents with foam blocks and turning off water to exterior spigots can also help. If pipes do freeze, gentle heat is best. Never use an open flame to thaw pipes. A hairdryer or portable space heater may be used, but ensure that the heater is suitable for indoor use and located well away from combustible materials.&nbsp;Also keep in mind that metal pipes conduct heat, so ensure that there are no combustibles on or near metal pipes.

							<p>TUMALO, OR -- A Tumalo home heavily damaged by fire Thursday night, again caught fire Friday morning. Bend Fire &amp; Rescue says the property owner contacted Central Electric Cooperative at about 9 p.m. when power went out at the the house on Grande Loop. Believing it to be a neighborhood outage, the homeowner went to bed. When the CEC technician arrived just before 10, he found smoke coming from the roofline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tech called 911 and helped the homeowner and two dogs safely evacuate. Arriving fire crews found an active attic fire and worked to quickly put it out. They remained on scene to make sure everything was fully extinguished and cleared at about 1:30 a.m. Investigators determined the blaze started from an electrical problem in the attic.</p>

<p>Just after 6 a.m., 911 received multiple calls about a fire at the same house. Crews again found flames shooting from the roof. After putting out the fire, it was determined to have been caused by smoldering material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following both incidents, damages to the home and contents are estimated at about $240,000, along with a $25,000 vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Bend Police set a record with drunk driving arrests in 2022, in part, thanks to the DUII team created earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bend PD&rsquo;s Sheila Miller says the department puts a large focus on DUII calls because the public has said it should be a priority, &ldquo;This last year, we created a DUII team and those officers&rsquo; entire job is to be out on the roads looking for drunk and high drivers. And they&rsquo;ve been super successful. We actually had one of our officers named the DUII Officer of the Year for the state of Oregon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As of last week, we were at 615 and I found out over the weekend that we had arrested six more. Last year, we finished the entire year at 509 DUII arrests, so that is a big jump and we still have several weeks; and those weeks tend to be very busy for DUIs,&rdquo; says Miller.</p>

<p>There could be more arrests before the year&rsquo;s end, due to holiday gatherings. &ldquo;People find themselves in a situation where they haven&rsquo;t made a plan and they aren&rsquo;t sure how they&rsquo;re going to get home. You know, there&rsquo;s just no excuse anymore for people to drive intoxicated in Central Oregon. There are rideshares and cabs,&rdquo; says Miller.</p>

<p>She says officers are also looking for distracted drivers.&nbsp;&ldquo;That is akin to driving drunk. You know, if you&rsquo;re driving and looking at your cell phone and not paying attention, it is the same effect as driving under the influence of alcohol.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Deschutes county commissioners appear poised to allow psilocybin service centers inside destination resorts who apply for a permit. That was a main part of deliberations at a meeting Wednesday to consider time, place, and manner restrictions for psilocybin businesses. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people have said they want access. Our initial proposal offered almost no access. Destination resorts is one way to expand access,&rdquo; said Commissioner Phil Chang who also supports service centers on Exclusive Farm Use land, to provide more options, &ldquo;In the ideal world I think I would support access in both those types of settings. The voters of Deschutes County have said twice that they want access to psilocybin services across the county; both the urban voting precincts and the rural precincts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commissioner Tony Debone agreed with his colleagues to also allow some options in forest and farm zones along with conditional use permits for destination resorts, &ldquo;When it comes to psilocybin specifically, I&rsquo;m not here to advocate for recreational use. We&rsquo;re talking about managed, safe, and approved environment. So, I&rsquo;m not opposed to allowing in the destination resort areas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chang, Debone, and Patti Adair were unanimous in deciding operating hours would be limited to the Oregon Health Authority standard of 6 AM to midnight.</p>

<p>They are set to vote on the code amendments at Monday&rsquo;s board of commissioners meeting.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- School districts continue to deal with the lingering effects of pandemic-era closures, like emotional and behavioral issues.</p>

<p>Jennifer Hauth and Megan Knoster, with Bend-La Pine Schools, say&nbsp;the upcoming winter break can lead to more &ldquo;dis-regulation&rdquo; when kids again lose the structure of school, but there are things parents and students can do to mitigate problems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monitoring screen-time, eating healthy, getting enough sleep, exercising, and remembering that it&rsquo;s healthy to acknowledge and express our feelings and reach out for help if needed,&rdquo; says Hauth, &ldquo;Some of our students, over the next two weeks, will miss the structure of school and will miss seeing friends, and so it&rsquo;s just important for us to make sure we&rsquo;re connecting with them and talking with them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also just pausing and acknowledging that it&rsquo;s ok for things to not be perfect, and to be struggling, and to also recognize that there are resources and supports available within the community,&rdquo; says Knoster. &ldquo;Students and families who are struggling to meet the needs of the family, while also dealing with a holiday season where there might be additional expenses. This time of the year, we also see a lot of re-experiencing of grief if people have lost a loved one. So, we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of students struggling with accepting and acknowledging that there&rsquo;s going to be a holiday season without a loved one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Families can access &ldquo;Care Solace,&rdquo; through Bend-La Pine Schools, if they need help connecting with a professional.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- OSU Cascades will soon offer a biochemistry and molecular biology degree.</p>

<p>Director of Communications Christine Coffin says students and business partners signaled they want this new program. &ldquo;What we were hearing from students was that they are interested in paths to pre-medicine. There are many students that are interested in medical school. From industry we&rsquo;re hearing that there&rsquo;s more and more work in the bio tech and bio science fields,&rdquo; said Coffin mentioning that several alumni work in Central Oregon, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very lucky to have really strong relationships with local industry including companies in the bio tech and bio science, where the managers are interested in creating pathways for students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This degree in biochemistry and molecular biology can really prepare students for all of those careers, graduate school, medical school, etc&hellip; Local companies can really help add to the student&rsquo;s academic work and career development activities,&rdquo; said Coffin.</p>

<p>The new program will be available to students starting in the Fall 2023.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-ece724c3-7fff-dcdd-4310-a75974d3a7be">The <a href="https://www.coic.org/natural-resources-environment/mirrorpond/">Mirror Pond Advisory Committee</a> meets Thursday&nbsp;to discuss plans for a fish passage project at the Newport Dam. Consultant and committee facilitator Vernita Ediger says engineers came up with three passage design options,&nbsp;"A traditional fish ladder, a nature-like fish byway - which is more of a channel around the dam, and I think it&rsquo;s called a ruffage channel - where it&rsquo;s kind of more of a rocky area that&rsquo;s built up toward the dam."</span><p><span>Now the committee needs to&nbsp;finalize the criteria for deciding which one is best. "</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-ece724c3-7fff-dcdd-4310-a75974d3a7be">Of course, effectively passing fish up and downstream and meeting state requirements for doing so is one of those things," Ediger tells KBND News, "Cost and fiscal responsibility is another concern. Thinking about public safety and making sure that any structure that&rsquo;s put in place doesn&rsquo;t create risk to the public." And, she says, it must be workable by all partners, including PacificCorp, who owns the hydro-electric dam.</span>&nbsp;"<span id="docs-internal-guid-ece724c3-7fff-dcdd-4310-a75974d3a7be">This is where everything gets real," she says, "It&rsquo;s really easy, when everything is conceptual, to agree. But, as soon as we start talking about nuts and bolts and pros and cons, things start to get pretty real. I&rsquo;m really hopeful that we&rsquo;ll have a really good decision matrix."</span></p><p>A public open house is planned for January, where the committee will answer questions about the design options and how they'll make a decision.&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-ece724c3-7fff-dcdd-4310-a75974d3a7be">The goal is to present a recommended passage design to the city and Bend Parks and Rec by late January or early February. But that&rsquo;s where the timeline gets vague. Ediger says there are still a lot of questions around when or even if to build a fish passage in Mirror Pond, including who will own and manage the structure? "Then you need to also think through the liability and who&rsquo;s taking that on."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ece724c3-7fff-dcdd-4310-a75974d3a7be">Thursday's virtual committee meeting starts at 10 a.m. Click <a href="https://www.coic.org/natural-resources-environment/mirrorpond/">HERE</a> for more information.</span></p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-be8833a7-7fff-ac4d-43f3-b54eb9961c07">The Mt. Bachelor shuttle&nbsp;started the season running once an hour, but will expand to every 15 minutes on Friday. Also Friday, "Mt Bachelor is opening Sunrise Lodge and we&rsquo;ll be adding that as a stop," CET's Eric Lint tells KBND News, "We&rsquo;re currently stopping at West Village, and as of this Friday, we&rsquo;ll also stop at Sunrise Lodge. And, of course, the end point here in Bend is at the Mt Bachelor Park and Ride, and that&rsquo;s near the skating rink." Lint says, shuttle buses will also soon be equipped with wifi for riders.</span><p><span>Tickets are $12 for a roundtrip or $7 one-way.&nbsp;</span>Tickets can be purchased in-person using exact change (one-way only) or in advance with the Umo Mobility app.&nbsp;<a href="http://cascadeseasttransit.com/">Cascades East Transit </a>manages the shuttle, but the service is funded by Mt. Bachelor. "<span id="docs-internal-guid-be8833a7-7fff-ac4d-43f3-b54eb9961c07">The cost of the ticket doesn&rsquo;t cover the full cost of the service and Mt Bachelor is subsidizing this because it helps their employees get up to the mountain as well," says Lint, "Mt Bachelor employees ride for free."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-be8833a7-7fff-ac4d-43f3-b54eb9961c07">Last year, the shuttle carried about 200 people a day to the mountain. Lint expects that number to grow this winter, and he says congestion on Cascade Lakes Highway has already started, "I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of chatter from my friends. One took an hour and a half to get down the mountain. No one likes to be in traffic, but if you&rsquo;re going to be in traffic, at least let someone else do the driving, right? And then, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about parking either. With all the changes happening at the mountain, this offers a convenient way to get out there and play."</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-be8833a7-7fff-ac4d-43f3-b54eb9961c07">To handle that increased demand and manage an ongoing driver shortage, CET and Mt Bachelor are offering an additional incentive for new hires. "If you get hired on to this route, you get a ski pass for yourself and a friend. And that&rsquo;s not just a one-time thing. That&rsquo;s, you can go up there as much as you like," says Lint. Many of the buses used for the shuttle do not require a Commercial Driver License.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-be8833a7-7fff-ac4d-43f3-b54eb9961c07">The first bus leaves at 6:30 a.m. from the Mt.

							<p>REDMOND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-136c4f83-7fff-8821-e651-ce5a4c9aaff7">Sunday&rsquo;s winter storm dropped a lot of snow on northern Deschutes County, but the Redmond Airport remained open. "Whenever you get almost, I think, 10" of snow over about an eight-hour period, it causes some strain on our operations to keep our airport open," Airport Director Zach Bass told KBND News on Monday, "Our people have done a great job."</span><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-136c4f83-7fff-8821-e651-ce5a4c9aaff7">He says a few flights were canceled the night before the storm hit, in anticipation of the conditions,&nbsp;despite runways remaining clear and open, "Sometimes, of course the airlines look at their own weather reporting and make decisions even prior to what actually might be the situation on the ground. So, we did see some cancellations. We have a few delays, but this storm is also kind of hitting a lot of the west coast."</span></p><p>

This latest dose of weather is a good reminder to give yourself extra time if you&rsquo;re flying through the Redmond Airport, this time of year.&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-136c4f83-7fff-8821-e651-ce5a4c9aaff7">Bass suggests accounting&nbsp;for road conditions and try to arrive two hours before your flight. "Very busy time of the year, there could be lines. So, the more time you give yourself - I realize that&rsquo;s tough when you have to get up at maybe 3:30 in the morning and sometimes you get through without a problem and you think, &lsquo;oh, why did I get up so early?&rsquo; But there&rsquo;s a lot of other times where that&rsquo;s not the case and that extra time really does help you make sure you&rsquo;re on your aircraft."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-136c4f83-7fff-8821-e651-ce5a4c9aaff7">He suggests checking your airline&rsquo;s website or mobile app before you arrive&nbsp;for any changes to your specific flight, a</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-136c4f83-7fff-8821-e651-ce5a4c9aaff7">nd&nbsp;do your part to move through security quickly, "Be aware of what kind of shoes you&rsquo;re wearing, if you have to take them off; make sure your laptop is at the top of your bag so you can take it out easier. And if you&rsquo;re traveling with a big family, it&rsquo;s hard. I have quite a few kids and when we travel, it&rsquo;s tough. But we try to think ahead about what needs to come out, where&rsquo;s the easiest way to put it, and kind of be mindful of everyone behind us."

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-4e9d5c63-7fff-c3ff-f0ac-702e56805e10">Bend Fire and Rescue has a math problem, says&nbsp;Fire Chief Todd Riley, "The cost of us doing our business is outpacing our revenue. At the same time, the demands for our service are increasing." The department&nbsp;</span><span>plans to ask voters to approve an increased operating levy next May. But first, they&rsquo;ll measure the current level of support for such a request.&nbsp;</span><p>

Riley tells KBND News a phone survey is now underway in Bend and the surrounding Rural Fire District,&nbsp;"The more that we can help the community understand what we do, the better chance we have of the community supporting us. So, part of this survey is, yes, to gauge voter interest in supporting our levy. But also, we&rsquo;re going to gauge what the community knows about Bend Fire and Rescue and the services we provide." He says a third-party survey company is calling residents this week,&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-4e9d5c63-7fff-c3ff-f0ac-702e56805e10">"How much do they know about Bend Fire &amp; Rescue? How likely are they to support our levy if it were to be on the ballot right now? And then, they would ask questions that dive deeper into our operations. &lsquo;Did you know that Bend Fire and Rescue &ndash;?&rsquo; and then fill in the blank." The survey takes about 15 minutes and runs through Saturday.</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4e9d5c63-7fff-c3ff-f0ac-702e56805e10">Chief Riley says determining what the public knows about the agency will also help shape messaging once the levy is on the ballot, "We have to pass this levy. And, speaking in terms the community understands with the issues that they care about, is the best way to get support for this ask. I mean, we&rsquo;re asking the community to increase funding for the fire department because our services depend, and they're essential for the voters to pass it."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-4e9d5c63-7fff-c3ff-f0ac-702e56805e10">The current tax rate of 20 cents per thousand dollars of assessed taxable value hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2014.

							<p>BEND, OR -- Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel will step down at the end of the month. He&rsquo;s served as the county&rsquo;s top prosecutor since 2014.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In essence the community was saying &lsquo;hey, we want you to keep us safe as District Attorney.&rsquo; And working with law enforcement and my team in the DA&rsquo;s office, we&rsquo;ve done that. There are fewer crimes of violence committed every year now, than when I started in Deschutes County,&rdquo; said Hummel</p>

<p>Along with the daily challenges and successes in the courthouse, he is proud of the cooperative work between his office, local law-enforcement, and non-profit groups, &ldquo;The innovative crime prevention programs we&rsquo;ve brought forward; (including) the Veterans Intervention program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He expects a seamless transfer in the DA&rsquo;s office when long-serving Chief Deputy Steve Gunnels takes over January 2nd. &ldquo;Steve Gunnels has been in our office for 28 years as a deputy attorney. He&rsquo;s been my chief deputy attorney during my entire 8-year tenure. So, we&rsquo;re continuing to work closely on this transition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunnels ran for the office unopposed and was elected in May.<br />
Hummel has no current plans to run for office again, but says he hopes to continue serving the public in some capacity.</p>

							<p>MADRAS, OR -- A Jefferson County man perished in a December 6th house fire that has now been ruled accidental. According to the Sheriff&#39;s Office, the blaze was reported on Lower Bridge Road at about 6 a.m. The person who called 911 believed the homeowner, 88-year-old Glenn Cooper may have been inside the home at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the initialy investigation, officials confirmed a body was inside. However, because of hot gasses, investigators were not able to process the scene until the following day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on evidence found later, investigators believe Cooper tried to put the fire out on his own but failed. They also say there were past issues with the wood-burning fireplace that contributed to the cause of the fire.</p>

							<p>PRINEVILLE, OR -- The Crook County Library board meeting was unusually packed Thursday as the members voted four to one to keep books with LGBTQ+ material in their current location on shelves.</p>

<p>Representatives from Deschutes Public Library, the Oregon Intellectual Freedom Committee, and State Library of Oregon testified on the potential loss of funding and other consequences of labeling or moving books to a separate location.</p>

<p>After some voiced concerns about the material over the past months, Library Services Director April Witteveen offered two proposals: segregate the books or keep them on the same shelves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the 2 dozen Prineville residents who spoke during the public comment at the meeting, 19 of them favored keeping the books in place. An informal &lsquo;show of hands&rsquo; vote taken by the board also showed the majority of those in attendance wanted to keep the status quo.</p>

<p>Witteveen read from a letter from the Crook County Court and shared her own thoughts prior to the public comment period, &ldquo;The county court hopes the library board&rsquo;s decision makes our community&rsquo;s library a welcoming enjoyable place for everyone in the community&hellip; I did just also want to thank the community members who have taken the time to write to the court, to write to the library board, to write to myself and library staff; sharing their perspective on this proposed action.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a">A home energy score will be required to sell a house in Bend, starting July first, following unanimous approval this week by the City Council. But the new ordinance is not without controversy.</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a">&quot;It&rsquo;s a cost to the seller, which is ultimately a cost to the buyer,&quot; says KBND real estate expert Fred Johnson. &quot;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a">Basically this is a regulation that says someone needs to come into your home before you can sell it. They&rsquo;re going to gather information on your home and they&rsquo;re going to charge you a fee for doing that, before you have a right to sell your home.&quot; City officials estimate the assessment would cost between $150 and $275.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a"><a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/642832">The program is aimed at addressing climate change</a>. But Johnson doesn&rsquo;t think it will do much,&nbsp;since sellers aren&rsquo;t required to act on what&rsquo;s in the report, &quot;It&rsquo;s going to be a requirement of all homes that go on the market that there&rsquo;s an energy assessment, whether they were built last week or they were built 20 years ago, with really no teeth in it. There&rsquo;s no mandatory items to mitigate any potential problems that are discovered. You basically are paying for someone to come in and gather information on the property.&quot;&nbsp;The ordinance does allow for a streamlined process for builders constructing the same plan on multiple lots, and there will be grants available for low-income sellers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a">He&#39;s also troubled by how the new regulation was passed, &quot;Obviously, there is a fair amount of dissent in the community. And yet, the vote still goes through unanimous; absolutely no dissenting vote. So, that means that there&rsquo;s a good section of the population - a good section of their constituency or whatever you want to call it - that are not being represented in the process.&quot; While several people testified the score should be optional, there were also supporters of the ordinance who said it will help home-buyers compare the expense of living in various houses and better understand the overall cost of homeownership.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4ecbc1a8-7fff-f7e6-9bc2-fc0dfe819e3a">City Council says the energy score program will be re-evaluated if it is deemed &ldquo;over-burdensome&rdquo; or if there are not enough assessors to keep up with demand.&nbsp;</span></p>

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-b59866de-7fff-c29d-2166-872d99a2ebf1">A new master plan is moving forward for the north end of Bend; it&#39;s a big step in the eventual relocation of Costco near Highway 20 and Cooley Road. Mayor-Elect Melanie Kebler says the City Council approved what&rsquo;s being called &ldquo;Gateway North&rdquo; after the developer brought the parking plan in line with city code. &quot;The developers had done a more specific study and brought us some different data, and they themselves said, &lsquo;Hey, here&rsquo;s what we need. We can reduce this down and we actually don&rsquo;t need that many. And, especially if we try to put in some of the other things that allow people in the neighborhood to have a bike share&rsquo; and to have some of the other mitigation that we were looking for, that made sense and that was a plan that they could get behind.&quot;&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://kbnd.com/podcasts/your-town">Kebler tells KBND News</a>, &quot;They were going to add back some of the bike parking we thought was missing, they&rsquo;re going to reduce the amount of parking they needed, and they were also going to do some things like adding some trees, some stormwater mitigation and also a little mobility hub for that whole area; because there will be some housing and other things, not just a Costco.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b59866de-7fff-c29d-2166-872d99a2ebf1">The Gateway North Master Plan also includes 422 housing units, mostly for senior living and multi-family.&nbsp;</span>Kebler admits the entire project is still years from the start of construction.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-b59866de-7fff-c29d-2166-872d99a2ebf1">Some have criticized the city&rsquo;s desire to reduce parking availability for such a popular store. But the <a href="https://bend.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=9&amp;clip_id=724&amp;meta_id=63091">latest plans submitted </a>appear to include more&nbsp;spots than at the existing Bend location at the Forum Shopping Center.&nbsp;And Kebler says it&rsquo;s important to balance space for other needs, &quot;There&rsquo;s a lot of activity happening in that part of town. I think we&rsquo;re going to see some other neighborhoods coming in as well. But I&rsquo;m pleased to see it&rsquo;s not just one type of development, but that they&rsquo;ve mixed together housing and commercial, which is I think what we need more of.&quot;</span></p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Deschutes County Health Services plans to use an $80,000 grant from the Central Oregon Health Council to purchase a mobile clinic.</p>

<p>Clinical Services Manager Anne Kilty is excited for the van that will provide services to people unable to get to clinics in Redmond and Bend.&nbsp;&ldquo;Some basic health screenings that could be useful out in the community: blood pressure checks, diabetes screenings. Our WIC team will be providing nutritional support, breastfeeding support, early dental intervention for pregnant and postpartum women and children up to the age of five. And then, our perinatal care team will be doing maternity case management services,&rdquo; says Kilty, noting the county has been working towards an outreach van since before the pandemic. She hopes to park the van in different communities at places like libraries, where patients can rely on their presence.</p>

<p>Deschutes County Commissioners approved the awarding of the grant at Wednesday&rsquo;s board meeting.</p>

<p>Kilty says patients may be more comfortable accessing the van for care rather than going to a clinic, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important that we reach out to people and communities that are not able to access the Bend and Redmond locations very easily. We know people have problems getting to the clinic; some people don&rsquo;t have good transportation, don&rsquo;t have resources to pay for gas, have childcare and work issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The van should be purchased and ready for use by July 1st.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR -- Deschutes County Commissioners on Wednesday approved adding a fourth floor to planned renovations at the County Courthouse. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Commissioner Phil Chang says the additional space is helpful, even if it isn&#39;t used by court staff initially. &ldquo;There are opportunities to use that space for activities, (and) organizations that are court-related. (That) makes it a much more attractive proposition,&rdquo; said Chang adding that an estimated $44.5 million &ldquo;is a very big price tag. That said, I definitely think that shelling out the fourth&nbsp;floor is a much more cost-effective option.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The commissioners were given an option to have three floors built. Commissioners Patti Adair and Tony DeBone also support the fourth&nbsp;floor option because of the space.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having another 10,000&nbsp;to 13,000&nbsp;(square feet of) flex space for future public safety, court proceeding needs is going to be very valuable,&rdquo; said Debone, while noting the County will be&nbsp;asking the legislature in their next session to help pay for the addition.</p>

<p>Next spring will see the completion of a schematic design along with an updated cost estimate. The Courthouse Expansion could be completed in two to three&nbsp;years.</p>

Even where it&rsquo;s been a little dryer, like southern Oregon and much of Central Oregon, those areas also received pretty significant snowpack."</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-5fa633e6-7fff-78ca-a9a7-1d45a62f441d">However, he says those November storms weren't&nbsp;all positive, "A lot of the early season storms, instead of precipitation as rain, that precipitation fell as snow at higher elevations. So, we didn&rsquo;t quite get the amount of rain early in the season that we usually get, and that&rsquo;s why some of the basins show below normal precipitation." He tells KBND News, "We would like to start to see more near-normal precip levels for more sites. Especially in Central Oregon, where they&rsquo;re still the highest levels of drought in the state."&nbsp;According to the <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?OR">U.S. Drought Monitor</a>, much of Crook County remains in &ldquo;exceptional drought&rdquo; - which is the highest level.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Warbritton says it's a good start to replenishing reservoirs that have dried out from several years of drought, but the trend needs to continue. "Those above normal conditions are needed because next summer they&rsquo;re going to be drawing directly from the water supply they get from this season&rsquo;s snowmelt and they can&rsquo;t really rely on any sort of carry-over."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-5fa633e6-7fff-78ca-a9a7-1d45a62f441d">The takeaway is, he says, this snowy trend needs to continue;&nbsp;we still need more moisture before next spring to recover from previous precipitation shortfalls.</span></p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

Tom Gauntt suggests caulking around doors and windows to seal off any leaks. For larger drafts,&nbsp;&quot;You know where the cold wind comes from and you say, &lsquo;Gee, I&rsquo;ve got a door that faces that cold wind.&rsquo; You can go to the store, and they have these nice little things for the bottoms of doors, or&nbsp;makeshift towels or an old rug or something to kind of keep that cold air from coming in.&quot;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-6878ccb3-7fff-6591-3f12-0d615d9f4261">Try not to heat rooms you aren&rsquo;t using.&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes it can be simply, &lsquo;You know what? We don&rsquo;t really use that spare room anymore.&rsquo; And you can turn down the heat vent that&rsquo;s in there,&quot; He tells KBND News not to turn heat off where pipes might freeze, &quot;You don&rsquo;t want to be foolish about it, if there&rsquo;s some water pipes in the room or something, don&rsquo;t cause a new problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-6878ccb3-7fff-6591-3f12-0d615d9f4261">Clean or replace furnace filters and make sure registers and intake vents are clear of furniture, so air can move freely.&nbsp;And, avoid the temptation to turn up the thermostat when it gets colder. Gauntt says it won&rsquo;t heat your house any faster, &quot;Try to set the thermostat at about 68. That might seem kind of cool to people but, if you can keep it there consistently and you have these other factors taken care of, it should keep you comfortable.&quot;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-6878ccb3-7fff-6591-3f12-0d615d9f4261">And, avoid relying too heavily on space heaters, &quot;If you have a 1500 watt portable heater running eight&nbsp;hours a day every day, you&rsquo;re looking at about $30 a month on the bill, right there, Those appliances have their place and we operate them safely and sparingly, it&rsquo;s fine. But just to say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to heat the garage all winter using that,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s going to be costly.&quot;</span></p>

							<p>REDMOND, OR -- Redmond&rsquo;s library will soon be on the move, in preparation for a major reconstruction project. Deschutes Public Library Director Todd Dunkelberg says they&rsquo;ll shift some books to the former Redmond Design Center on South Highway 97&nbsp;in mid-January. It's about a quarter of the size of the current facility, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely a temporary location. We&rsquo;ll have some popular materials there to checkout, and people can place holds and we&rsquo;ll have that service going. And then we&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of work out in the community," Dunkelberg tells KBND News, "So, a lot of the programs that you normally would&rsquo;ve gone to the library, we&rsquo;ll be holding at different venues around Redmond."<p>The current 20,000 square foot library will be torn down and a 40,000 square foot facility built in its place, slated to open in August of 2024. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a meeting room that can hold about 240 people, tutor space; one-on-one meeting space where people can meet to tutor people, you could have a Zoom meeting. We&rsquo;ll have a co-working area, some really neat creative and do-it-yourself areas," says Dunkelberg, "It&rsquo;ll have a drive-up window in Redmond, so on those cold days where you don&rsquo;t feel like getting out of your car you can pull up, we&rsquo;ll hand the books to you."</p><p>Redmond's Jessie Hill School was built in 1919 and has housed the library since 1996. Dunkelberg says it's just <span id="docs-internal-guid-06992b51-7fff-612a-3ad3-8bedd7e1d007">too small for the community now. "We needed a building of about 40,000 square feet&nbsp;to serve Redmond and how much it&rsquo;s grown. We started off looking at how could we remodel that building and make it work? And it just didn&rsquo;t work for us." He says he recognizes it's a loss for Redmond, "It was a really tough decision but we really wanted to be right in the heart of the city of Redmond. And talking with the city of Redmond, they were very interested in keeping us in the same location, as well."</span></p><p>Nearly every branch in the Deschutes Public Library system will be renovated in 2023, as part of the $195 million bond passed by voters in 2020. Dunkelberg says, "Really, the biggest piece of all this is the Children&rsquo;s Discovery Spaces, that we&rsquo;re doing in all of our libraries. But that was the number one thing that people said they wanted to see in their libraries, when we went out and talked to almost 7,000 people across the county.&rdquo;</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.deschuteslibrary.org/futurelibraries/redmond/">HERE</a> to learn more about the Redmond Library project, and get details on a Thursday open house.&nbsp;</p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

							<p>LA PINE, OR -- Firefighters responded to a report of a blaze in the Ponderosa Pines Neighborhood of La Pine, early Wednesday morning. Arriving crews found fire coming from the back of a two-car detached garage and&nbsp;extending to the attic, just after 3 a.m.</p>

<p>Amid temperatures in the mid-teens and snowy conditions, they knocked down the flames and extinguished the fire, preventing it from spreading to the nearby home and vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone inside got out safely, after seeing the glow of the fire. Investigators believe it started outside the garage and involved a pile of firewood, although the exact cause remains under investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Todd Montgomery is the Founder and Director of OSU&rsquo;s <a href="https://osucascades.edu/sustainable-tourism-lab">Sustainable Tourism Lab</a>, and says the money will further his team&rsquo;s work, "It first started with Visit Bend in January.

St. Charles reported&nbsp; St. Charles reported concerns to law entorcement after Pineda-Garcias&#39; explanation did not seem consistent with the injury. Because the child did not disclose any abuse at that time, he was allowed to return to the home.</p>

<div>Law enforcement executed a search warrant at the home Pineda-Garcia shared with her son Macias in July 2018, where they found a set of seven&nbsp;mason jar-type glasses. Sheriff Jason Pollock,&nbsp;a</div>

<div>detective at the time, moved the refrigerator in the home and located a glass fragment. A second glass fragment with a lip that appeared to match the mason jars was discovered under the stove. The individual who treated the child at st. Charles testified his injury was consistent with being struck with a mason jar.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Pineda-Garcia was convicted of&nbsp;Assault in the Second Degree, Unlawtul Use of a Weapon, Assault in the Third Degree (3 counts), Criminal Mistreatment in the First Degree (3 counts), Assault in the Fourth Degree, and Harassment.

							<p>BEND, OR -- The Bend Christmas Parade makes its way through downtown Saturday.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s theme is a High Desert Christmas. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for everybody to kind of just celebrate in the spirit of the high desert where we live and just kind of embracing that fabulous topography and everything that we have and incorporating that into their theme of their floats in some way, shape, or form,&rdquo; said the Parade Committee&rsquo;s Dina Barker who is grateful for the scores of volunteers, along with the Oregon National Guard Youth Challenge Program, who make the parade possible.</p>

<p>Parade Chairman Michael Sipe expects a record number of entrants. &ldquo;This is the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary of the volunteer committee doing it. So, this is going to be the biggest one ever. We have over a hundred entrants. Last year was the biggest turnout of the parade. Thousands of people out on the streets. From all of the people that have been doing it for 30 years they said &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve never seen any kind of turnout like this&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Sipe who is also excited about this year&rsquo;s special dignitary, a former St. Charles CEO, &ldquo;Jim Lussier is the Grand Marshall. He&rsquo;s obviously one of the finest gentleman and biggest community leaders that we have in Central Oregon. So tremendous opportunity for us to say thank you to him for his years and years in community leadership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parade starts at 12 pm beginning on Newport Avenue, travels down Wall Street, then by Drake Park, and finishes on the corner of Galveston and Harmon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drivers need to watch for street closures along the route.</p>

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-c07da64c-7fff-2dfb-1182-c4cca45e0b3b">Roadside assistance for electric vehicles is coming to Bend. AAA's Marie Dodds tells KBND News a pilot program is&nbsp;expanding&nbsp;to members in Central Oregon, offering mobile charging for EVs that run out of "juice." </span><p><span>She says, "We&rsquo;ve been doing it for drivers of gas and diesel-powered cars for decades, and now we can provide a similar service providing &lsquo;fuel,&rsquo; if you will, to drivers of electric vehicles. So, we can charge your depleted EV right there on the roadside and get you back on your way." Dodds estimates it takes about 30 minutes to charge enough to drive 10-14 miles, "What our service does is give you enough electric vehicle charge, if you will, so that you can drive safely to your home or to a close charging station." </span></p><p><span>She says having an emergency service like this could ease worries for car buyers interested in purchasing an EV,&nbsp;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-c07da64c-7fff-2dfb-1182-c4cca45e0b3b">"&lsquo;Range anxiety&rsquo; is a top concern for folks who are thinking about purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle. They worry about having enough range to be able to drive where they need to go."</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c07da64c-7fff-2dfb-1182-c4cca45e0b3b">Portland was one of just six cities in the pilot program when it launched in 2011. It&rsquo;s now in 14 cities nationwide.&nbsp;Dodds says it&rsquo;s a sign of how mainstream EVs have become, "To have Portland and Bend on the list, two of only 14 cities across the country, this is a big deal for our area. And, of course, for Oregon it makes sense because electric vehicles are very popular here. They continue to grow. Oregon is fourth per capita in the nation." Of the 14 cities where the mobile roadside charging service is now available, only three are on the west coast: Bend, Portland and San Francisco.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">

"What happens in those scenarios, or those incidents, when an officer goes in, they don&rsquo;t know exactly where a suspect may be, so they&rsquo;re listening for indicators as to where to go. And the video shows the officers going in one direction, they hear an indicator, they immediately change directions and approach and then confront, at that point, the shooter who had already committed suicide."&nbsp;Police reports also released Thursday reveal around 30 off-duty Bend officers arrived to the scene after the initial response by on-duty teams.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-daf3efe9-7fff-791b-9cb2-d794ad3c5b65">Chief Krantz says the video&rsquo;s release is in response to public records requests by the media, "This is material that we felt we were obligated to release, legally. However, we also feel that it&rsquo;s pretty horrific material; it&rsquo;s violence that doesn&rsquo;t need to be really released into the world, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be watched by people." <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/650283">KBND News will not name the shooter</a> nor provide&nbsp;the footage released Thursday.</span></p><p>Bend Police say they provided advance notice of the video's release to Safeway management and the District Attorney's Victims Assistance office, who made sure the victims' families were made aware.

							<p>Bend, OR -- Following her re-election last month, Deschutes County Commissioner Patti Adair is ready to move forward with her plan to create more affordable housing.</p>

<p>She says she has a pilot project headed to the legislature, &ldquo;Senator Knopp has picked it up. The single-wide manufactured home park north of bend with over 300 single wide homes for people who work in Deschutes County. So, if I can get that project through legislature, the long session, that will really be a coup for all of Deschutes County.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m really appreciative of Senator Knopp&rsquo;s team being behind that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adair acknowledges the cost of building affordable housing is a concern alongside other projects including expanding the county courthouse.</p>

<p>Adair says legislation to allow ADUs in rural parts of Deschutes County is held up in SB-762, the state&rsquo;s sweeping wildfire mitigation bill, but she&rsquo;s hopeful it will move forward eventually, &ldquo;I really felt like the Accessory Dwelling Units need to be started as soon as possible. We are short 5,000 homes in Deschutes County. We&rsquo;re short them now; it&rsquo;s going to be even worse next year if we don&rsquo;t get something done.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

							<p>REDMOND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-7dbc7e4d-7fff-b73e-030b-44e3165050bc">Redmond is moving its wastewater treatment plant out of the Dry Canyon. Wastewater Division Manager Ryan Kirchner says the current facility is near capacity and expanding the current site would cost around $104 million. Instead, he says the city plans to develop a new wetlands complex, at a cost of around&nbsp;$70 million.&nbsp;</span>"<span id="docs-internal-guid-7dbc7e4d-7fff-b73e-030b-44e3165050bc">The Redmond Wetlands Complex is going to be a brand new wastewater treatment system for the city of Redmond," Kirchner tells KBND News, "We&rsquo;re completely relocating our treatment plant from the Dry Canyon, and moving it out to the irrigation and biosolids disposal site." Orchard grass grows on that site now, where <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/663996">hundreds of goats are currently chomping away</a> to clear the land before winter.</span><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-7dbc7e4d-7fff-b73e-030b-44e3165050bc">Kirchner says this will be a natural site, similar to the <a href="https://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/250087">Crooked River Wetlands Complex in Prineville</a>, but larger. "We&rsquo;ve mirrored some other utilities throughout the region," he says, "And did a lot of knowledge sharing to try to find a treatment solution for Redmond because it&rsquo;s been growing drastically over the last 20 years and it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with that population growth. Our current plant is about at its capacity for what it can accept; we&rsquo;re within three to five years. And so, this new plant will add an additional 20 years." It will also be cheaper to operate, he says, because there are fewer mechanical parts. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>And, city officials hope it will become a community asset, "Instead of our current plant which is cyclone fence and we keep the public out, the new plant is actually going to have park amenities:&nbsp;ADA trails, park features, passive park features. We&rsquo;re building water conservation areas to show the community how they can change out their land and go to xeriscaping. We&rsquo;re also working with Redmond School District and a lot of the organizations throughout the region to build curriculums for public education."</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-7dbc7e4d-7fff-b73e-030b-44e3165050bc">Kirchner says they plan to develop the 607 acres of city-owned land currently growing orchard grass, and lease an adjacent parcel of&nbsp;625 acres from the BLM. He expects they'll break ground in August,&nbsp;</span>with completion slated for early 2026.&nbsp;</p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7dbc7e4d-7fff-b73e-030b-44e3165050bc">The BLM is now taking public comment on the city&rsquo;s lease request. A required 30-day public scoping period ends December 30. The Bureau will also conduct an environmental assessment.&nbsp;</span>Public comments must be submitted by mail (Deschutes Field Office; Deschutes Field Manager, 3050 NE 3rd Street 491, Prineville, OR 97754) or <a href="mailto:blm_or_pr_lands@blm.gov?subject=Redmond%20Wetlands%20Complex">email</a> by 4:30 p.m. on December 30.

							<p>BEND, OR --&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-2f6b716c-7fff-42aa-4644-353c1585b47a">St. Charles hospitals are seeing a steady rise in RSV and flu cases, and officials worry the peaks for both could still be several weeks away.&nbsp;</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-2f6b716c-7fff-42aa-4644-353c1585b47a">St. Charles Health System Pediatric Hospitalist&nbsp;Dr. Suzanne Mendez says pediatricians are treating more co-infections, "We&rsquo;re starting to see some RSV plus flu, together. When you have two viruses together, then it can be much more severe. Or, if you&rsquo;ve just gotten over RSV and then get flu within the next couple weeks, that can make a much more serious case of flu as well."</span><p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-2f6b716c-7fff-42aa-4644-353c1585b47a">Public Health reports 283 Central Oregon cases in, <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/COMMUNICABLEDISEASE/DISEASESURVEILLANCEDATA/Documents/RSV/RSV_Oregon.pdf">as of last week</a> - the last week for which numbers are available - that's up from 275 the week before. At one point Wednesday afternoon, St. Charles reports there were&nbsp;nine admitted patients with RSV, and another five in the Emergency Department.&nbsp;There were also 17 patients with influenza. In a typical year; officials say 12 would be a high number. Eight other patients have tested positive for COVID-19.</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-2f6b716c-7fff-42aa-4644-353c1585b47a">"All the hospitals in Oregon are really - especially pediatric hospitals are really overwhelmed at this point. So, we&rsquo;re hoping at least RSV will peak in the next few weeks. But then, we&rsquo;re starting to see more flu," Dr. Mendez tells KBND News, "So, just being cognizant that there are somewhat limited resources due to some many people being sick at the same time." She asks everyone take steps to stay healthy and says this year's flu shot formula is helping keep people out of the hospital, "A lot of the tests that we do, the swabs will show up positive for influenza 2009, which was our last really, really severe flu season, when we had H1N1. So, [we&rsquo;re] seeing some of that virus again and it does look like the flu vaccine is very effective." She also suggests families keep kids home and hydrated if they do get sick, and keep them away from younger siblings who may be more prone to severe RSV.</span></p><div class="ckeditor-html5-audio" style="text-align: center;">
