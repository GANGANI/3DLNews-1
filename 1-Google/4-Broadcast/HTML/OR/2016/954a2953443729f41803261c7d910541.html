	(Olympia, WA)&nbsp; --&nbsp; A group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers hope the Washington State Supreme Court will respond positively to a required progress report on the Legislature&#39;s efforts to fully fund public education.&nbsp; The Everett &quot;Herald&quot; reports the lawmakers approved the report yesterday and intend to file it on May 18th.&nbsp; The report says the Legislature fulfilled the high court&#39;s mandate during the 2016 session and passed a plan for ensuring that a constitutional means of funding public schools is in place by 2018.&nbsp; The lawmakers disagree on whether their actions during this year&#39;s session will be enough to convince the Supreme Court to lift a contempt order and end sanctions totaling nearly 28-million dollars in fines.</p>

	(Olympia, WA)&nbsp; --&nbsp; Governor Jay Inslee is asking for an explanation from Washington State Auditor Troy Kelley on why he fired some of his office&#39;s senior staff.&nbsp; Kelley made the moves last week, including asking for the resignation of his chief of staff and his spokesman, and putting a former spokesman on administrative leave.&nbsp; The actions were taken after Kelley&#39;s federal trial, in which a jury acquitted him on one of 15 counts against him and was unable to come to a decision on the remaining charges.&nbsp; Inslee says he&#39;s &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about Kelley&#39;s &quot;troubling actions&quot; regarding multiple members of his senior staff.</p>
