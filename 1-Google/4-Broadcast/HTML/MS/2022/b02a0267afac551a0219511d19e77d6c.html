That's what used to happen in Jackson, Mississippi in the mid 80s. Dave worked at WJTV and Karen worked across town at WAPT. \n\nBoth came to WLOX in 1985 and have been an anchor team ever since, even being inducted into the Mississippi Broadcast Hall of Fame together. \n\nYou can see them both on The 4 O'Clock Show and WLOX News at 5:00 p.m. But Karen's not just an anchor. She's also the WLOX health reporter.\n\n\"I love bringing people information that can really make a difference in their lives,\" Karen says.\n\nHer Healthwatch reports are very popular.\n\n\"Health news is a challenge to keep up with because there is so much research. And that research leads to new advances in medicine everyday.\"\n\nKaren also works throughout the year on special health projects like the St. Jude Dream Home Giveaway. Every year, Karen hosts the giveaway bringing us stories about South Mississippians who are treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. \n\nKaren also enjoys acting in local stage productions. She's had the lead role in several of them. Her love of the theater led to the creation of the WLOX Backstage report. Backstage allows Karen to give you a preview of local plays during WLOX News at 5:00 p.m. when they are ready to open.","org":"WLOX","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News Anchor","slug":"karen-abernathy","source":{"source_id":"64103"},"status":true,"twitter":"KarenWLOX","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2023-01-26T20:55:46.691Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wlox","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":4,"bio_page":"/authors/karen-abernathy/","website_url":"/authors/karen-abernathy/","headlines":{"basic":"Karen Abernathy"},"description":{"basic":"Karen Abernathy came to WLOX in 1985 as a news anchor.

One of his earliest memories was witnessing Hurricane Georges make landfall and experiencing firsthand the ferocious winds of a storm. He also enjoyed visiting the local Children’s Museum with his parents and couldn't get enough of sitting behind the anchor desk of the mock television studio there. Clearly, his fascination with broadcast meteorology was taking root early on.\n\nAfter graduating from Benjamin Franklin High, Wesley earned his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from the University of South Alabama. He started his TV career in Marquette, Michigan, where he tracked snowstorm after snowstorm at WLUC. He then made his way down to Monroe, Louisiana at KTVE, where he sharpened his skills at breaking severe weather coverage by tracking tornadoes.\n\nEventually, Wesley made yet another move, this time back down to the Gulf Coast at WLOX in Biloxi, Mississippi, where he has become a familiar face to wake up to on Good Morning Mississippi in recent years. Wesley is thrilled to help everyone start their day with a smile, whether it's sunshine or tracking the next storm system. He's certainly no stranger to hurricane season. Even though his passion for tropical weather developed early on in life, it was a dedicated college course that caused that passion to flourish.\n\nNowadays, Wesley and his high-school-sweetheart wife spend their spare time discovering local eateries, enjoying the beach, and exploring the charm of Coastal Mississippi.
