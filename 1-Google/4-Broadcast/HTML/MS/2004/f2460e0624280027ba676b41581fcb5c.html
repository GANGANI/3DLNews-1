She returns to South Mississippi after spending nearly four years as an Anchor/Reporter with WCBI-TV in Columbus, MS. During her time in the Golden Triangle, Stephanie reported on everything from breaking news to local feature stories in the community.  \n\nIn 2019, Stephanie met with families affected by a devastating EF-3 tornado that ripped through the southside of Columbus. The storm aftermath left citizens without a place to home for several months. She rolled up her sleeves to follow community clean-up and recovery efforts led by area organizations in the Friendly City. In 2022, Poole traveled to Macon, MS for a rescue mission after a severe storm left two women trapped under a collapsed building. \n\nPoole also kept an eye on what's happening in MS classrooms. She visited several school districts in the Golden Triangle regarding COVID-19 restrictions, teacher shortages, and technology.  \n\nPoole was awarded Mississippi Association of Broadcasters Third Place Reporter for Small Market TV. \n\nStephanie is a 2018 graduate of Mississippi State University #HAILSTATE. She began her broadcast career as a reporter on the student television show at MSU, Take30. Later, she worked for Cumulus Broadcasting Media as a radio talent and remote assistant from 2018-2019. \n\nPoole joins the WLOX News Now team with a humble heart. \n\nWhen Stephanie isn't on-air, she's dining on the Gulf Coast catch of the day--seafood. Whether it's char-grilled oysters, crabs, or shrimp, you can find her placing an order at her favorite restaurants.  \n\nShe also enjoys working out, painting, and playing a round of Uno with

She currently resides in Mobile, Alabama, and recently graduated from the University of South Alabama in December 2023 with her Bachelor's in Broadcast Journalism.\n\nDuring her time at the University of South Alabama, Destiny was a member of Kappa Delta Sorority where she was able to hold several different leadership positions, all while juggling different Journalism-based courses- but her passion for broadcast journalism actually began in high school.\n\nDestiny participated in Ocean Springs High School's student-produced newscasts for 2 years before college, even winning an award her senior year. The desire to create and share information has always been a big part of Destiny's life, and she is so thrilled to kick off 2024 and her post-graduation career by joining the team at WLOX as an MMJ. \n\nAside from this, Destiny is very creative and artistic. When she's not spending time with her parents and 5 siblings, she can be found painting, drawing, making social media content, or frantically reorganizing her entire house.

In January 2024, Bill became a Good Morning Mississippi Anchor.\n\nThe Biloxi native worked for two years at WAPT in Jackson before his first stint with WLOX, which included a two-year run as the station's capital reporter from 1994-96. From there, Bill moved back to the Coast and worked alongside A.J. Giardina as a weekend sports anchor. Bill was also part of the Edward R. Murrow Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina's arrival and aftermath along the Coast. \n\nIn late 2005, he left the world of television and worked as public relations coordinator and sports information director at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College for nine years. During that time, you may have seen Bill anchoring the college's award-winning football coaches show \"Bulldog Blitz,\" which aired on WLOX.\n\nIn recent years, you probably saw Bill working at Mississippi Power events when he worked for the utility company for a little more for three years. On Friday nights each fall, you likely heard him broadcast Biloxi Indian football games.\n\nBill is an MGCCC and Southern Miss alum and recently married fellow Golden Eagle Paula Delcambre. Paula and Bill's two children, Colin and Caroline, can all tell you his passion comes out during football season, when every four days in the fall his beloved MGCCC Bulldogs, Biloxi Indians, Golden Eagles and Saints take to the gridiron. \n\nFor now, he’s back home, working to bring you the news for South Mississippi.","org":"WLOX","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News Anchor","slug":"bill-snyder","source":{"source_id":"62410"},"status":true,"twitter":"BillSnyderWLOX","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2024-01-09T18:53:45.957Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wlox","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:19:29.705Z","description":{"basic":"Quality, not quantity.

She joined in October 2016.\n\nPatrice is a proud native of New Orleans, Louisiana, so she knows about good food and good times. As a child, she dreamed of being on television like her role model Oprah Winfrey.\nPatrice started out speaking at her church, Greater St. Stephen and different city events. Eager to get involved in the media as a child, Patrice worked at a radio station in New Orleans, AM 940, as a co-host of a local teen talk show.\nPatrice graduated from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana.  During college, she worked as a Reporter/Anchor for her college television station and KTIB local radio station. She also interned at FOX 8 News in New Orleans.\nAfter earning a degree in Journalism, Patrice moved back to her hometown and worked at WWL Television as an assistant assignment editor. She also helped produce the youth program \"Our Generation.\"\nPatrice then moved to South Mississippi to work as a tape-editor at WLOX, but she was determined to be in front the camera. In her off time, she worked on her writing and storytelling.  After a lot of hard work, her dream came true and she was offered the Jackson County bureau chief position.  She was also a weekend live reporter and fill-in anchor at WLOX.   In 2016, She made a move to Jackson, Mississippi, to continue telling people stories.\nShe has interviewed business leaders, former presidents, governors, and Hollywood celebrities. But what touches Patrice's heart the most is helping and informing people in the community, a goal she fights to accomplish with each story.\nWhile at WLBT, Patrice has won first place for Best Public Affairs reporting from the Louisiana-Mississippi Associated Press Broadcasters and Media Editors. She also won first place for best Short Light Feature.\nPatrice also reached an educational milestone in 2019. She graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mass Communication at Jackson State University. On top of that, she was the Salutatorian of her program.\nWhen Patrice is not chasing a breaking news, she loves traveling, reading good books, and spending time with her family, friends, and sorority sisters. Yes, she is proud member of Delta Sigma Theta. But shopping is Patrice's true love. She and her mom can spend all day going from store to store.\nPatrice is also very spiritual; she credits the Lord for all her blessings, including her journalism career.","org":"WLBT","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News

She graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Mississippi where she was also a Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College graduate.\n\nWhile at Ole Miss, Courtney Ann worked as anchor, reporter and producer for NewsWatch, the student-run live broadcast. She was selected as the station's only credentialed Spin Alley reporter at the 2008 Presidential Debate that was held on campus. She continued to sharpen her reporting skills while working as an intern for Talk Radio News Service in Washington, D.C. She reported daily on Senate and House hearings, press conferences and various events throughout the city.\nShe has worked as an on-air reporter in Jackson since 2010. She is currently on air for both WLBT and FOX 40 and is the 6:00 p.m. co-anchor and statewide reporter. As part of her statewide duties, she sends stories Monday-Friday to WCBI (Columbus), WTOK (Meridian), WDAM (Hattiesburg) and WLOX (Biloxi). \nJackson received the first place for TV Reporter in a Large Market during the 2021 Mississippi Association of Broadcasters Excellence in Broadcasting Awards. \n\nJackson covers the State Capitol during the legislative sessions each year, often times gaining exclusive interviews with policymakers and helping break down the most complex issues of the day for viewers across the state. Her statewide coverage isn’t limited to the Capitol. For example, she was sent to Los Angeles in 2016 to cover the American Idol finale and is often sent to other parts of the state for significant breaking news and weather events.\n\nShe’s covered a wide range of stories, including: presidential visits, prison riot protests, sit-down interviews with governors, votes and commission meetings to change and replace the state flag, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, statewide and congressional elections…just to name a few.\n\nCourtney Ann served as a panelist for the 2018 Mississippi U.S. Senate Debate hosted by WLBT and Mississippi Farm Bureau which was televised across the state. Her insight into that Senate special election also afforded her the opportunity to provide a Facebook live conversation for NBC News on how Mississippi’s election could impact the makeup of the Senate. \n\nJackson shoots and edits her own video, writes the stories and then appears on camera daily.\n\nHaving grown up in Mississippi, Courtney Ann knows there are extraordinary stories to be told in this state and she looks forward to uncovering more of them.\nCourtney Ann enjoys spending time with her husband, family and friends. When she’s not at work, she can be found cooking, entertaining, dancing, traveling, and exploring locally owned shops and restaurants.

As a native of Ocean Springs, Noah has spent most of his life on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. \n\nAfter graduating from St. Patrick High School in 2015, Noah moved to Hattiesburg to attend The University of South Mississippi. There, he pursued degrees in Media Production and Criminal Justice. In May 2019, he graduated as Top Media Production Student. That same month, he joined WDAM as the evening News Producer. \n\nA year and a half later, he moved back to the Gulf Coast and became a Multimedia Journalist with WLOX.

She returns to South Mississippi after spending nearly four years as an Anchor/Reporter with WCBI-TV in Columbus, MS. During her time in the Golden Triangle, Stephanie reported on everything from breaking news to local feature stories in the community.  \n\nIn 2019, Stephanie met with families affected by a devastating EF-3 tornado that ripped through the southside of Columbus. The storm aftermath left citizens without a place to home for several months. She rolled up her sleeves to follow community clean-up and recovery efforts led by area organizations in the Friendly City. In 2022, Poole traveled to Macon, MS for a rescue mission after a severe storm left two women trapped under a collapsed building. \n\nPoole also kept an eye on what's happening in MS classrooms. She visited several school districts in the Golden Triangle regarding COVID-19 restrictions, teacher shortages, and technology.  \n\nPoole was awarded Mississippi Association of Broadcasters Third Place Reporter for Small Market TV. \n\nStephanie is a 2018 graduate of Mississippi State University #HAILSTATE. She began her broadcast career as a reporter on the student television show at MSU, Take30. Later, she worked for Cumulus Broadcasting Media as a radio talent and remote assistant from 2018-2019. \n\nPoole joins the WLOX News Now team with a humble heart. \n\nWhen Stephanie isn't on-air, she's dining on the Gulf Coast catch of the day--seafood. Whether it's char-grilled oysters, crabs, or shrimp, you can find her placing an order at her favorite restaurants.  \n\nShe also enjoys working out, painting, and playing a round of Uno with friends!\n\nIf you have a story idea for Stephanie, follow her on Twitter @StephPNews or send her an email

She currently resides in Mobile, Alabama, and recently graduated from the University of South Alabama in December 2023 with her Bachelor's in Broadcast Journalism.\n\nDuring her time at the University of South Alabama, Destiny was a member of Kappa Delta Sorority where she was able to hold several different leadership positions, all while juggling different Journalism-based courses- but her passion for broadcast journalism actually began in high school.\n\nDestiny participated in Ocean Springs High School's student-produced newscasts for 2 years before college, even winning an award her senior year. The desire to create and share information has always been a big part of Destiny's life, and she is so thrilled to kick off 2024 and her post-graduation career by joining the team at WLOX as an MMJ. \n\nAside from this, Destiny is very creative and artistic. When she's not spending time with her parents and 5 siblings, she can be found painting, drawing, making social media content, or frantically reorganizing her entire house.

In January 2024, Bill became a Good Morning Mississippi Anchor.\n\nThe Biloxi native worked for two years at WAPT in Jackson before his first stint with WLOX, which included a two-year run as the station's capital reporter from 1994-96. From there, Bill moved back to the Coast and worked alongside A.J. Giardina as a weekend sports anchor. Bill was also part of the Edward R. Murrow Award-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina's arrival and aftermath along the Coast. \n\nIn late 2005, he left the world of television and worked as public relations coordinator and sports information director at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College for nine years. During that time, you may have seen Bill anchoring the college's award-winning football coaches show \"Bulldog Blitz,\" which aired on WLOX.\n\nIn recent years, you probably saw Bill working at Mississippi Power events when he worked for the utility company for a little more for three years. On Friday nights each fall, you likely heard him broadcast Biloxi Indian football games.\n\nBill is an MGCCC and Southern Miss alum and recently married fellow Golden Eagle Paula Delcambre. Paula and Bill's two children, Colin and Caroline, can all tell you his passion comes out during football season, when every four days in the fall his beloved MGCCC Bulldogs, Biloxi Indians, Golden Eagles and Saints take to the gridiron. \n\nFor now, he’s back home, working to bring you the news for South Mississippi.","org":"WLOX","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News

She currently resides in Mobile, Alabama, and recently graduated from the University of South Alabama in December 2023 with her Bachelor's in Broadcast Journalism.\n\nDuring her time at the University of South Alabama, Destiny was a member of Kappa Delta Sorority where she was able to hold several different leadership positions, all while juggling different Journalism-based courses- but her passion for broadcast journalism actually began in high school.\n\nDestiny participated in Ocean Springs High School's student-produced newscasts for 2 years before college, even winning an award her senior year. The desire to create and share information has always been a big part of Destiny's life, and she is so thrilled to kick off 2024 and her post-graduation career by joining the team at WLOX as an MMJ. \n\nAside from this, Destiny is very creative and artistic. When she's not spending time with her parents and 5 siblings, she can be found painting, drawing, making social media content, or frantically reorganizing her entire house.

The desire to create and share information has always been a big part of Destiny's life, and she is so thrilled to kick off 2024 and her post-graduation career by joining the team at WLOX as an MMJ. \n\nAside from this, Destiny is very creative and artistic. When she's not spending time with her parents and 5 siblings, she can be found painting, drawing, making social media content, or frantically reorganizing her entire house.

She graduated in May of 2022 with her degree in Broadcast Journalism and minor in creative arts.\n\nDuring her time at South, she was a member of the National Society for Leadership and Success and the Black Student Union. When she wasn’t juggling school and 2 off-campus jobs, she was the Operations Manager and Host of “Let’s Talk about It” on the school’s radio station 97.1 The Prowl.\n\nAfter graduating, she began working in News Sales in Mobile.
