It&#8217;s his way of showcasing the Polish composer&#8217;s development toward genius.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very interesting to hear his early works as stepping stones to the more mature works,&#8221; Ganz says. &#8220;You get to see him grow before your eyes and ears in the manner of time-lapse photography.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(That&#8217;s two metaphors, if you&#8217;re counting.)<\/p>\n<p>Ganz is on a mission to perform every one of Chopin&#8217;s piano compositions. Chopin was prolific in his short lifetime &#8212; he composed approximately 250 pieces for solo piano before he died at the age of 39. There&#8217;s no exact count of his works, as the origins of one or two compositions commonly attributed to him are still unconfirmed.<\/p>\n<p>Ganz expects the challenge to take him a total of 15 years. (His wife teases him for taking so long to play essentially 18 hours worth of music, &#8220;and she&#8217;s right, I am kind of slow,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I do love to savor the whole process, so I&#8217;m in no hurry.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Ganz will get one step closer to his goal this Saturday, when he performs his 10th annual &#8220;Extreme Chopin&#8221; concert at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strathmore.org\/events-and-tickets\/np-brian-ganz-chopin-genius\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bethesda&#8217;s Music Center at Strathmore<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Z-r-p4cVdFI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Ganz first fell for Chopin as a kid growing up in Columbia, Md. He went on to study and eventually teach at the Peabody Conservatory of Music at Baltimore&#8217;s Johns Hopkins University. Ganz&#8217;s love of the Romantic composer\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.culturespotmc.com\/news\/internationally-acclaimed-pianist-brian-ganzs-10th-anniversary-of-extreme-chopin-quest-with-chopin-the-growth-of-genius\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earned him the nickname<\/a>\u00a0&#8220;the Chopin guy&#8221; among students. He also sit on the faculty of St. Mary&#8217;s College of Maryland and has performed with orchestras including the St. Louis Symphony, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, and the Baltimore Symphony.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday&#8217;s concert will mark the first time Ganz employs his musical gardening technique for an entire performance. He will perform five episodes of gardening made up of 20 total works, including the famous\u00a0<em>Funeral March<\/em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Polonaise-Fantaisie <\/em>and\u00a0Waltzes, Op. 34 and Nocturnes, Op. 27. He plans to explain some of his the reasoning behind his &#8220;harvest&#8221; to the audience during the show, but will try to keep the talking to a minimum. &#8220;It&#8217;s already a long show,&#8221; he laughs.<\/p>\n<p>Learning every piece by a single composer might sound rather tedious, but Ganz seems to be filled with a bottomless supply of exuberance for Chopin. Even when pressed he couldn&#8217;t think of one composition he didn&#8217;t like practicing. Rattling off his favorites was much easier.<\/p>\n<p><em>Polonaise-Fantaisie<\/em>\u00a0appears on his list. He calls it one of Chopin&#8217;s most affecting works; to him, it feels more like a journey than a song, capped off with a &#8220;luminous&#8221; climax at the end.\u00a0Chopin wrote the polonaise at the height of his genius, just three years before his death.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Once he reached his maturity, everything he composed was a masterpiece,&#8221; Ganz says. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a baseball player with an .800 average.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another metaphor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Ganz will perform &#8220;Chopin: The Growth of Genius&#8221; at the Music Center at Strathmore on Feb. 1 at 8 p.m.<\/em><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Brian Ganz will perform his 10th annual &#8220;Extreme Chopin&#8221; concert at Bethesda&#8217;s Music Center at Strathmore on Saturday.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/01\/31\/a-chopin-obsessed-pianist-will-try-musical-gardening-for-his-next-performance\/","currentSlug":"a-chopin-obsessed-pianist-will-try-musical-gardening-for-his-next-performance","created":"2020-01-31T07:26:30","modified":"2020-01-31T09:41:16","time":"Jan 31, 2020","timestamp":1580455590,"timestampGMT":1580473590,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Pianist Brian Ganz is the creator of the \u201dMusical Gardening\u201d technique.

In preparation, he signed up for a five-week clown school in Florida.<\/p>\n<p>It was the late 60s, and more people were applying to clown college than you might expect. &#8220;Statistically, it was harder to get in that year than Yale Law School,&#8221; Horwitz jokes. But he was accepted and later &#8220;joined out,&#8221; as they say in circus slang, with Ringling.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5183286\" style=\"width: 466px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5183286 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/image002-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"466\" height=\"473\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Murray Horwitz was a clown for three years in the early 70s.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Murray Horwitz<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In the circus, he performed twice a day and three times on Saturdays. &#8220;I was terrible,&#8221; Horwitz said of his early days in the circus. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t getting any laughs.&#8221; But performing for an audience so often was great practice for his future in show business.<\/p>\n<p>After leaving the circus, Horwitz moved to New York with the hope of continuing his career in entertainment. He was featured on an episode of the detective show &#8220;Kojak&#8221; called &#8220;The Pride and the Princess,&#8221; in which he played &#8212; in his words &#8212; a &#8220;dumb cop.&#8221; He also directed episodes of soap operas like &#8220;Guiding Light,&#8221; &#8220;Search for Tomorrow,&#8221; and &#8220;As the World Turns.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Horwitz began working with Richard Maltby Jr. in 1976 on what would become the award-winning musical &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Misbehavin&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; about the jazz legend Fats Waller.<\/p>\n<p>He said they weren&#8217;t trying to make a hit. &#8220;All I saw was problems,&#8221; he said of the first performance. &#8220;It was awful.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Then, he saw his wife&#8217;s face and knew &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Misbehavin&#8217; &#8221; was a success.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;She had her hand to her mouth and she said, &#8216;Oh my God, this is the best thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life,&#8217; &#8221; Horwitz said.<\/p>\n<p>Horwitz also became something of a mentor to a young Lin-Manuel Miranda, his son&#8217;s roommate at Wesleyan University.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I went to the bookstore and I bought him a rhyming dictionary,&#8221; Horwitz said.\u00a0&#8220;We&#8217;ve known him for 20 years &#8230; and I have to say, all this mega-success could not happen to a nicer guy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 1987, Horwitz came to D.C. to take a job at the National Endowment for the Arts. Soon after, he was offered a position at NPR as the director of cultural programming, overseeing jazz, classical and entertainment. During his time there, he helped create one of the most popular shows in NPR history &#8212; &#8220;Wait, Wait&#8230; Don&#8217;t Tell Me!&#8221;&#8211; working with the legendary Doug Berman of &#8220;Car Talk&#8221; fame on the idea of a quiz show.<\/p>\n<p>The same year that &#8220;Wait, Wait&#8230; Don&#8217;t Tell Me!&#8221; premiered, Horwitz began work on what became the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Horwitz helped conceptualize the award in an effort to celebrate the comedian Richard Pryor in the final years of his life.<\/p>\n<p>When the cultural programming department at NPR was eliminated, Horwitz moved on and became the founding director at the AFI Silver Theater and Cultural Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.<\/p>\n<p>AFI not only refurbished the previously vacant Silver Theater, which was built in 1938 by the noted architect John Eberson, but also contributed to the revitalization of the downtown.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We managed to help revivify the Silver Spring community,&#8221; Horwitz said. &#8220;It really did mean a lot to the people there, and still does.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5183282\" style=\"width: 2536px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5183282\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2536\" height=\"1856\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-300x220.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-1024x749.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-1500x1098.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-900x659.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-600x439.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/190808_Horowitz_03-1-1600x1171.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2536px) 100vw, 2536px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Murray and Kojo have been friends for a long time.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>These days, Horwitz refers to himself as &#8220;semi-retired.&#8221; When he&#8217;s not hosting WAMU&#8217;s The Big Broadcast, he&#8217;s working as artist-in-residence at Washington Performing Arts.<\/p>\n<p>One of his proudest moments at Washington Performing Arts came in 2014, when he decided to put together a show to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the singer Marian Anderson&#8217;s recital on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We did a concert at DAR Constitution Hall, from which she had been banned,&#8221; Horwitz said. &#8220;We had everybody from MC Hammer, to Jessye Norman, to Wolf Blitzer on the stage paying tribute to Marian Anderson.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In his second part-time job as host of WAMU&#8217;s The Big Broadcast, Horwitz gets to bring the art of vintage radio to a whole new generation &#8212; including a surprising audience: kids.<\/p>\n<p>He says he&#8217;s thrilled when a 12-year-old writes in with a question about the program. &#8220;I remember &#8216;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&#8217; and &#8216;Gunsmoke&#8217; on the air,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be 70 years-old next month.

credits his staying power in the industry to his ability to understand new crafts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In everything that I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve really been lucky in that I knew the art form,&#8221;

Seen\u2019","content":"<p>Many of the images we see of refugees, migrants and immigrants portray them as burdens on society or victims of oppression.<\/p>\n<p>A new photo show, <em>Another Way Home,<\/em> offers a different narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Curated by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opensocietyfoundations.org\/\">Open Society Foundations<\/a>, a philanthropic organization founded by George Soros, the exhibit is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opensocietyfoundations.org\/voices\/announcing-moving-walls-25-another-way-home\">the latest installation<\/a> of its annual Moving Walls series. The series is dedicated to social justice, and this year, the topic is migration. The show opened on September 26 at the group&#8217;s office in New York City and runs until July 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The Foundation received more than 400 submissions and chose 13 photographers, artists and storytellers. Many of the winners are immigrants, migrants or refugees themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We aim to emphasize the individual acts of bravery and self-sacrifice as well as the resilience of familial and community ties that exist amidst stories of great risk and pain,&#8221; said co-curator Yukiko Yamagata in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>One activist photographed a Mexican immigrant among colorful handcrafted pi\u00f1atas, which she sells to support her family in Queens. A designer traveled to Italy to cast African migrants in a high-end fashion shoot. A photographer asked a refugee family in Lebanon to re-create a tough moment: serving the children grass, because there was nothing else to eat.<\/p>\n<p>Each artist will receive up to $60,000 from the Foundations to continue their work. Here&#8217;s a sampling of the art and photography.<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;You are beautiful&#8217; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Wal\u00e9 Oy\u00e9jid\u00e9 is the designer behind Ikir\u00e9 Jones, an African-inspired fashion label, and helped work on the wardrobe of <em>Black Panther<\/em>. He immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria in his teens. In a photo series called <em>After Migration<\/em>, he turned to an unlikely source for his models: African migrants.<\/p>\n<p>He says he told them, &#8220;You are beautiful. How can I show you as you&#8217;d rather be seen?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He worked with local nonprofit groups in New York City, Rome and Florence to cast migrants from countries like Gambia, Guinea and Nigeria. He says he paid them the same rate as professional models: a couple of hundred dollars a day.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Many had the same reaction that you and I would have&#8221; to being cast, he says. &#8221; &#8216;Oh, you think I&#8217;m good-looking?&#8217; It puts a smile on your face.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;I want a rainbow bridge&#8217; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Layqa Nuna Yawar is a muralist based in New Jersey. He moved to the U.S. from Ecuador at age 14. He now travels the world painting murals in collaboration with migrant and immigrant communities and low-income populations.<\/p>\n<p>This year, he teamed up with an organization called the Esperanza Neighborhood Project in New Brunswick, N.J., to create a mural representing mothers from Oaxaca, Mexico, in the community.<\/p>\n<p>For inspiration, he asked members to share their ideas. One told him, &#8220;I want a rainbow bridge to show we can keep families together.&#8221; Others shared their dreams: &#8220;I want to make my mom happy,&#8221; and &#8220;My son is my dream.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yawar wove all their ideas together into the final piece: An indigenous woman embroidering a traditional Oaxacan fabric. &#8220;Threads,&#8221; he says, &#8220;keeping families together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;We deserve to have an opinion&#8217; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Sol Aramendi, from Argentina, has been working with Latina immigrants in New York City since 2003. Her organization, Project Luz, organizes art and photography workshops to encourage women to tell their stories \u2014 and gain the confidence to call America their home.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I want them to start thinking of themselves as artists, with their dance, arts and crafts,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I want them to think, &#8216;We have rights, we work here. The streets are ours. We deserve to have an opinion.&#8217; &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>Valeria Reyes, one of the women she photographed, is from Mexico and lives in Queens with her family. After her boyfriend abandoned her and left her without money, she started making and selling pi\u00f1atas.<\/p>\n<p>Creating these handicrafts made Reyes feel something deep. &#8220;I&#8217;m practicing my culture and traditions, even though I&#8217;m in this country,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;Authors of their own stories&#8217; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Thana Faroq is a Yemeni refugee living in the Netherlands. Her project, <em>The Passport<\/em>, documents &#8220;the people who would cross oceans and land masses to obtain a passport that will guarantee them a higher value in life,&#8221; she said in an audio statement. She could not attend the opening event in New York because her visa was denied, according to the Foundations.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to capturing everyday moments of a refugee&#8217;s life \u2014 the window of her room at the camp, chalkboard drawings made by refugee children on the asphalt \u2014 she asked some of her subjects to write letters.<\/p>\n<p>She wanted refugees to &#8220;be the authors of their own stories, to be willing to express their own feelings,&#8221; she said in the statement.<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;They feel a part of America&#8217; <\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Jessica \u00c1valos, Koral Carballo and Anita Pouchard Serra want to show what migration looks like from the perspective of the home country. So they documented life in Intipuc\u00e1, El Salvador, where residents have been emigrating to the U.S. for decades.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The people are very proud [of the migrants],&#8221; says Carballo. There&#8217;s even a statue in the town square which, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2015-05-04\/salvadoran-town-where-migrants-are-hotly-debated-folk-heroes\">town folklore<\/a>, commemorates the country&#8217;s first migrant to America, who left Intipuc\u00e1 in the 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Signs of the town&#8217;s ties to America are everywhere \u2014 ads for Salvarodan businesses in Maryland in the stadium, a mural of the New York City skyline in one home, a replica of the Statue of Liberty on a front porch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They feel a part of America because their family lives there,&#8221; says \u00c1valos. &#8220;It&#8217;s an example of how one culture can affect another.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><h3><strong>&#8216;The inspiring, surviving attitude&#8217;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>Omar Imam is a Syrian artist based in Amsterdam. In his project, <em>Live, Love, Refugee,<\/em> he collaborated with Syrian refugees across Lebanon to re-create their dreams of escape, love and terror in a series of staged images. Props include balloons, a magician costume and dragon wings.<\/p>\n<p>Like Faroq, he could not attend the event in New York because his visa was denied. So he sent a voice memo, saying: &#8220;Google Syria or Syrians, you will find billions of results &#8230; It&#8217;s always the destruction, blood, rubble, boats and dead kids.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he wanted to focus on &#8220;the inspiring, surviving attitude.&#8221; In his artist statement, Imam said he hoped that the project would give his subjects a sense &#8220;of catharsis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In one photo, a woman named Amenah is seated at a table set with silverware and a white tablecloth. A man is serving her a bundle of grass. The reenactment plays on a hellish memory at Yarmouk, a camp in southern Damascus: &#8220;We had to eat grass,&#8221; she told Imam. &#8220;I forced myself to swallow in front of the children so they would accept it as food.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2018 NPR.

NPR\u2019s Interview With China\u2019s Ambassador To The U.S.","content":"<p><em>In a wide-ranging interview with <\/em>Morning Edition<em>&#8216;s Steve Inskeep, Cui Tiankai, China&#8217;s ambassador to the U.S., discusses trade and openness between the two countries, better understanding President Trump, China&#8217;s social credit system.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Steve Inskeep:<\/strong> <strong>What is preventing an end to the trade war with the United States, if anything?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Cui Tiankai: Well, first, we certainly don&#8217;t want to have a trade war with the United States or with any other country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have one. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, this is very unfortunate but we want to solve it through negotiation and consultation between the two sides. But in order for the negotiation, the consultation to succeed, we do need goodwill and good faith from both sides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you seeing goodwill or good faith from the United States? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, to tell you the truth, not sufficiently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the evidence of that? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, for instance, the U.S. position keeps changing all the time so we don&#8217;t know exactly what the U.S. would want as priorities. And number two, I think there&#8217;s been some attempt on the U.S. side to force something like, the U.S. will get 100 percent and China will get zero. I don&#8217;t think this is fair. I don&#8217;t think this is possible. We are ready to make a deal. We are ready to make some compromise, but it needs the goodwill from both sides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ambassador, you used the word priorities. I&#8217;m reminded that a few months ago the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin went to China for some negotiations and it was said that the United States made a very wide range of demands that were rejected out of hand by China. Is that what you mean by priorities, that you want the United States to pick a few items rather than demanding every complaint be fixed at once? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, actually in the last few months there have been contacts between the two governments and from the U.S. side, not only the treasury secretary but the secretary of commerce, USTR and others also went to China and we also have very senior people come here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sure. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion in many areas. And we offered to reduce the trade deficit of the United States, for instance. And we also presented a very good proposal to the U.S. side about the further reform and opening up in China, some of the so-called structural issues. We are ready to work on the issues. Then I think more than once we had some tentative agreement between the two working teams. Then just overnight the tentative agreement was rejected and the demand from U.S. changed. So this is very confusing, and this is making things very difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You must try to calculate what happened there. Do you believe that U.S. negotiators went back to the president and he was not satisfied? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we would like to have somebody to tell us the real story.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That perhaps leads to another question. What is your method, and I assume you must have one, for trying to determine what the president of the United States thinks or is thinking at any given moment? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we&#8217;ll have to look at the policy statements, we have to look at the way what the U.S. team would tell us on the negotiating table. But I think that we still need more good faith. If people tell you one story one day and another story, a very different story, another day, then you are confused.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you follow the president&#8217;s Twitter feed?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think that many people are following &#8230; Twitter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Millions, sure. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So we are just doing the same.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But do you find meaningful information there? Some of his political allies will, say, disregard that, his actual policies are something else. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, I think if it&#8217;s written by the president, it has to be meaningful. People have to take them seriously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There was a news story here suggesting that foreign embassies and consulates were buying large numbers of copies of a Bob Woodward book about the inner workings of the White House. Is the Chinese embassy filled with copies of Bob Woodward&#8217;s book? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You see there has been such a heated discussion about this book in the American media. Naturally people would like to get a copy and see what happens, what is written in the book. Maybe this is very good for the publisher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is that a yes? You have lots of copies of <\/strong><strong><em>Fear<\/em><\/strong><strong> around the Chinese embassy? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How about you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really up to the individuals whether they want to buy it or not. I certainly have a copy. Anything that is discussed here in the American media we have to follow, we have to have some understanding of it, what happens. Because maybe people in the United are not fully aware of this, but American policies do have a larger impact on the rest of the world. So I have talked to many other ambassadors here, ambassadors from other countries, large or small. We all share the same concern. We also, we \u2014 all of us want to have a better understanding of what is happening here and what it would mean for us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel you understand the president at this point?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I hope that we could have a better understanding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That&#8217;s a no I guess, you don&#8217;t quite understand him. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think between any two countries or even between any two individuals, understanding is a process, because the world is changing, countries are changing, people are changing. Today you have a good understanding and tomorrow things have changed. You have to have a good, a better understanding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Matt Pottinger, a National Security Council aide in the White House came, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, to an event for China&#8217;s national day, and gave a little talk in which he said that the keyword between the United States and other nations such as China shouldn&#8217;t really be cooperation it should be competition. He wants to compete. He didn&#8217;t say make an enemy of China but he said competition. Is he right? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think between any two countries, maybe especially between China and the United States, there is a certain degree of competition. This is only natural. But there&#8217;s also a much larger need for cooperation. This is also the reality in today&#8217;s world. Our two countries together with other countries are faced with so many common challenges, the so-called global challenges or global issues, and no country can really handle all these things all by itself. We have to cooperate whether we like it or not. This is a growing mutual need and a common interest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But we may be at a point where the United States and China are not inclined to cooperate on some very high-profile issues. You disagree about the U.S. role in Asia to give an example. You disagree about what to do about Iran and the nuclear deal. You disagree about what to do about trade. Perhaps we&#8217;re entering a period of competition. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, as far as China is concerned that we are always ready to cooperate with the United States even if we have differences and maybe just because we have differences the need for cooperation is even bigger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What have you thought about as there have been news reports that the administration has considered proposals to ban Chinese students from studying in American universities? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think if this is true, I think that this is a very dangerous situation because so many Chinese students are studying here and a growing number of American students are studying in China. Such people-to-people contact would be the real foundation of friendship and the cooperation between the two great countries. And I could give you a very specific example. You see in the state of Indiana&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Indiana, Indianapolis, where I&#8217;m from. OK. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s a children&#8217;s museum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sure, it&#8217;s a great one. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great one. And a few years ago the museum hosted a big, big event on Chinese culture. It was a very, it was a great success. And I was invited to address the opening ceremony and I had a meeting with then-Gov. Mike Pence. Gov. Pence was a great supporter to such people-to-people intercultural exchanges. It&#8217;s certainly a benefit to both, people of both countries. And the local people, they were so enthusiastic about such cultural events. So why should we cut off all these ties, all these natural ties between the two peoples?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would you encourage greater openness going the other way? If American scholars who may have controversial opinions want to visit China, if American journalists want to go to sensitive areas like Tibet. Would you encourage greater openness on China&#8217;s part? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You see, we are open to American students, professors, journalists or scholars. Of course, for some other places like Tibet because it&#8217;s very high altitude and the climate could be very tough there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Very high altitude? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think American journalists and scholars can handle the altitude. I mean, we have high altitudes in the United States. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, not everybody could quickly get used to such climate and natural conditions. Even for Chinese. Many of them would not feel very well once they are there. And also the local, we have to protect the local environment. We should have some limit on the number of people outside visitors every year. Otherwise the burden on the environment will be too heavy. So we have to take care of all these things. If we can take good care of all these things we certainly welcome American visitors to go there. I understand for the last few American ambassadors, all of them visited Tibet. We are now working for the visit by Ambassador Branstad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Terry Branstad, President Trump&#8217;s ambassador. You want him to go to Tibet. What about Uighur<\/strong><em><strong> <\/strong><\/em><strong>areas?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He wanted to go to Tibet, and we would welcome him.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What about Uighur areas in far northwest China? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, this is part of China. So the whole country is open to the rest of the world, certainly this part is also open. But honestly, in this part of China we have a particular problem or challenge that that is terrorism. There are violent extremist groups. I&#8217;m sure some people are there, some attempt to create a situation like the ISIS in that part of China. This is very dangerous. This is a main challenge, the main threat to stability to the well-being of the people there and the government has to do something about that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There seemed to be very widespread actions against the populace with the concern about terrorism given as the reason. What have you thought about as the United Nations has said that hundreds of thousands of people in Uighur areas have been put into camps?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You see very often widespread stories may not be the true stories. They will be very far away from the truth. I think whatever we are doing in that part of China is for the well-being and safety and security of the people there, is to protect large interests of the people there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you putting people in camps to do that? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not, you see, first of all, we have to take a measure to make sure that groups like ISIS &#8230; will not be spreading in that part of China. Secondly, we have to make sure that people have means to build a better life. First, they have to learn more skills. They have to learn techniques to develop themselves. And also we have to maintain local stability. So what is happening is that we are doing whatever we can to make sure that these terrorist threats will be removed. Secondly, the whole society will be stable, people will feel safe and secure. And last but not least, people have the skills to catch up with the technological advance today and they would be able to build a better life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>People will be listening carefully to your words because you can speak so well and you&#8217;re so diplomatic. They may hear you saying that, yes, there are camps, and it&#8217;s a place where people are educated. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, I&#8217;m not saying there are camps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you saying there are not?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying there are camps. I think of their efforts to help people to learn skills, techniques to build up their economic capability and so on. And of course we have to take measures to prevent terrorism from spreading all over the place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let me ask about another measure that could be seen as a security measure across the country. Americans have read something in some cases about what&#8217;s called the social credit system. What is it? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think we now have maybe unfortunately growing crimes in terms of finance and there&#8217;s been cases of cheating and fraud, all these things. So if you look at Chinese media, there are reports of senior citizens being cheated. They&#8217;ve been ripped off of their lifelong savings. So we have to do something to protect such a vulnerable people. And that&#8217;s why I think that is part of the reason why people want to have a better social credit system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think that you&#8217;re referring to the fact that the social credit system seems to have begun as a kind of blacklist for people who have conducted inappropriate financial activities. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And it&#8217;s become something that follows you around, right? The government knows who you are and you might be banned from travel. You might be banned from getting on a train or a plane. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think if people here in the United States, if you don&#8217;t pay your debt to the bank, if you don&#8217;t pay for a credit card, then the banks will have a record.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sure. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That makes it very difficult for any individual with such a record to have loans from banks. We are just doing the same lesson. Maybe we&#8217;re just learning it from you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But you might also ban someone from travel. I don&#8217;t think a bank would do that here in the United States. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think there have been cases of very few individuals who made secret threats to other passengers on trains on airplanes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If they&#8217;re seen as a threat. OK. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think I have read media reports here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oh, there are no-fly lists in the United States of people who are suspected of some terrorist connection. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not suspected, I have seen media reports here about people making secrets threats to other passengers on the airplane and they are taken away by the police.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If people speak in the wrong way on the airplane, sure. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If they shout for instance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If they make a threat to other, they get taken away by the police here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, but I&#8217;m asking about something else where someone is on a black list because of a financial issue. And so they can&#8217;t travel. That happens right. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, if people do have a bad record whether in terms of finance or making secret threat to other people, they have to be punished. But there&#8217;s a time limit, maybe for six months or maybe longer. It&#8217;s not lifelong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Could this system be extended to cover also speech? Someone&#8217;s social media postings are monitored and they might find any number of consequences in every part of their lives if they say the wrong thing. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think people can do all these at random. They have to follow, they have to do everything in accordance with China&#8217;s constitution and Chinese laws. If there is a clear provision in the laws, then they have to enforce it. If it&#8217;s prohibited by the laws, nobody can do it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There is a lot of speech that would be off limits in China more so than in the United States. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, if you get on the Chinese social media you could see how what kind of freedom we have. All kinds of talks on social media.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There is a robust debate without a doubt. But there&#8217;s also certain terms that get banned on social media that disappear from social media. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You see, I think we&#8217;re both our countries \u2014 maybe also other countries \u2014 are faced with a problem of like child pornography and spread of terrorist ideas, all these things, very bad things. Criminal things on social media. And this is challenging for all the governments to make sure that it will not hurt the well-being of the people, of our ordinary citizens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One more question along these lines and then I want to move on. Some analysts will presume that China&#8217;s government, strong and organized though it is, is somewhat afraid of its people and what it will do. Is the government afraid of the people in China? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the first thing for our government, the most important thing for the government is accountability to its people. We always believe that our first, our most important task is to make sure that our people will be able to have a better life. So &#8230; the government got its authority from the people and it is accountable to the people. So the people is the most important thing for us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You said a better life. In the United States we could argue about this but one might argue that the fundamental value in the United States is equality and that another fundamental value is freedom or liberty. You&#8217;re saying that providing a better life, the government providing a better life for its people, is a more fundamental value in China. Is that correct? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, the task of the government to be more exact is to enable the people to pursue a better life. It&#8217;s not given by the government to the people, the people have the right to pursue a better life. And the government&#8217;s responsibility is to make sure people will have the capability, will be able to enjoy such a right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let me ask also ambassador, about the United States direct relations with China beyond trade. What in your view is an appropriate role and appropriate position for the United States in East Asia, in your region in the waters around there and in nations around in that area? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You see, both China and United States, we are Pacific countries. We&#8217;re on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sure. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And we believe that the Pacific Ocean is not something that will separate us but something rather that will link us, will connect us. And we certainly recognize the interest of the United States and the role the U.S. has played historically in our region. We welcome that. We look at the United States as a major partner in our region, but at the same time we hope that the United States would also recognize that the regional countries including China have our own legitimate interests. Maybe the U.S. should learn to have a better understanding of our history, our culture, our needs and would pay more respect to that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the South China Sea, which I will remind people is an area where China claims bits of land and China fundamentally claims the waters, and an area where the United States has been sending naval vessels, is the South China Sea China&#8217;s? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have sovereignty over many of the islands in the South China Sea. And this has been a longstanding position of China despite a change of government. You see, in 1949 and actually at the end of the Second World War, the then-Chinese government took back these islands from occupation of Japan with the help of American naval ships. It was American naval ships that sent Chinese troops to take back these islands from Japan. So we have a longstanding sovereignty over these islands, but we are also aware there are some territorial disputes. And now we&#8217;re ready to work with other countries to have negotiations to have a final solution to such disputes. We understand this will take a long time, but in the meantime it is our intention to maintain stability there. That&#8217;s why we are working on a code of conduct with the ASEAN countries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The other Southeast Asian nations, right. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, we&#8217;re making good progress in this regard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A code of conduct meaning means of living a means of operating in and around the South China? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It means before we are able to solve the territorial disputes, we should work together to maintain stability, to try to engage in some joint development of resources there, to keep a good order in the region. So I just hope that the United States will join our efforts, will be helpful, not try to disrupt the process towards peaceful negotiations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the negotiation you describe something like this: China claims the waters, China claims the natural resources under the waters and might undertake joint development with the Philippines if the Philippines recognizes China&#8217;s claim. Is that where you&#8217;re going with this? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that we cannot make comments of a very general nature like this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OK. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to look at the specific islands, specific reefs and decide which country has the sovereignty in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, what territorial water you could have, what kind of exclusive economic zone you could have. It&#8217;s very specific.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Of course you cannot predict the future any better than I can, but you must make assumptions I presume and your government must make assumptions about the next few years and in that light I want to ask about North Korea. Do you believe that North Korea will ever give up its nuclear arsenal? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have been working very hard towards that goal. We want to have a clear denuclearization of the whole Korean peninsula. We want to maintain peace and stability there. This has been China&#8217;s goal all along. And fortunately for the last few months there&#8217;s been some progress between us and the DPRK toward that goal and we would support and encourage further progress towards that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You just said denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula, North and South Korea. What does that mean for the United States? We&#8217;ve heard that term many times but what is it that the United States is supposed to do or give up on the southern side? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, my recommendation would be the United States should continue its talks with the North Koreans and try to take steps to encourage the DPRK to take further steps towards denuclearization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I just mean I don&#8217;t understand what on a basic level, as a layman, what that term means for the United States. The United States has a nuclear arsenal and is allied with South Korea and isn&#8217;t likely to give up its thousands of nuclear weapons. So what does denuclearization mean? Just no American nuclear weapons in South Korea which there aren&#8217;t at the moment anyway? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not only no American nuclear weapons but the DPRK should not have nuclear weapons either. That&#8217;s very clear. But as for the definition of the idea denuclearization, I hope for the United States and the North Koreans could reach some agreement on this. And you see Secretary Pompeo is going to North Korea again. I hope he has some clear idea to present to the North Koreans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you presume that the North Koreans are sincere about being willing to give up their nuclear weapons as part of some larger agreement? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think they are serious in the change of policy. They are telling everybody that they want to focus on their economic development. I think the need is clearly there. They have to do a better job with regard to the economy and the North Korean people certainly want a better life and it&#8217;s in the interest of all the countries concerned that we should have peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You said serious. You think they&#8217;re serious. Meaning you don&#8217;t agree with those who think that Kim Jong Un is simply playing the Trump administration, trying to get some benefits out of this and string them along. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that they are serious about this policy change. Besides, it seems to me that President Trump believes that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One final thing ambassador and I&#8217;ll let you go. You&#8217;ve been very, very generous with your time and I&#8217;m very grateful that you&#8217;ve put up with all the questions. Thank you. We as a network have been reporting on China&#8217;s involvement around the world, economic and otherwise, in Africa. There was a story on [Wednesday] about an effort to build a city with Chinese money and Morocco. What is China&#8217;s goal beyond its own borders \u2014 10 years from now, 20 or 30 years from now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, for China, maybe for a long, long time to come, our priority, our most important task is still to run our own country well, make sure people continue to live in peace, they will enjoy social stability, they will have a better life, and they have a better future to look forward to. This is the most important task for China, for the government and for the people. But we also understand China cannot develop and modernize in isolation. We have to build strong ties with the rest of the world. We have to further integrate into the global economy and the global governance, and we are ready to take up more responsibilities and make greater contribution in this regard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about the form that that would take and I&#8217;m thinking about history. There was a time when Britain spread its influence around the world and the way that it commonly did that was by taking over countries, establishing colonies, dominating places. There has been a time when the United States has spread its interest around the world and the United States consciously concluded that for the most part the United States would not try to take over territory but would try to get other parts of the world to play by the same rules in an international system. That is one way to summarize the U.S. approach. What is the Chinese approach? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you look at the Chinese culture, Chinese history, I think you would understand it has never been the intention of China to acquire other peoples&#8217; territory. You see, 2,000 years ago we build the Great War just to protect ourselves, not to invade, although such walls may not work but now it&#8217;s a tourist spot anyway.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Very attractive, yes. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And a few hundred years ago in the Ming dynasty we did have the largest and the strongest fleet in the world at the time. The fleet visited many countries on more than one occasion but they never set up colonies, they were just promoting trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Meaning that you do not see any historic parallel for China taking over territory but how much influence would Chinese planners or national security officials aspire to have in Africa? How much influence would you aspire to have in Europe as you build trade ties with Europe for example. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think as countries develop trade and other ties between them naturally there will be a mutual influence. For instance, American influence in China has been growing for the last few decades. That&#8217;s why so many Chinese students are coming here because they know that you have some of the best universities in the world. They want to study there. And their parents are paying for their tuition and living costs. So I think such people-to-people ties will naturally have hopefully a very positive influence on all everybody involved. This is a very good thing. Such a broad understanding and the strong ties between people will be the real foundation, not only for relations between China and United States but also for world peace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has President Trump&#8217;s unsettling of relations with traditional U.S. allies created an opportunity for China to make new friends or to build influence? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whatever Washington D.C. is doing we will continue to develop friendly relations with the rest of the world. Maybe you see European countries, other Asian countries, countries in Africa, Latin America \u2014 but hopefully we&#8217;ll make more mutual friends. It&#8217;s not a zero-sum game. Chinese friends could be American friends and I think our two countries have to make sure that we have more and more mutual friends. We don&#8217;t ask other people to take sides. Why should we do that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ambassador, thank you for coming by. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thank you, thank you for your time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I really enjoyed this conversation. <\/strong>  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2018 NPR.

Wants To End Trade War But \u2018U.S. Position Keeps Changing,\u2019 Ambassador Says","content":"<p>China&#8217;s ambassador to the United States says his country is &#8220;ready to make a deal&#8221; to end a trade war with the United States \u2014 if they could find a trustworthy partner in Washington.<\/p>\n<p>Cui Tiankai accused the United States of shifting positions and passing up opportunities for agreement. The United States has been escalating tariffs on imports from China, and China he responded with taxes on U.S. goods.<\/p>\n<p>Amid rising tension, the veteran Chinese diplomat sat for a wide-ranging interview at NPR headquarters Wednesday. He offered a window into some of the frustrations of the world&#8217;s most important international relationship, as a dominant power spars against an increasingly powerful one. The fight pits China&#8217;s deeply entrenched leader Xi Jinping against the unpredictable President Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Cui, elegantly dressed and silver-haired, asserted that the trade war could be resolved through &#8220;good faith.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are ready to make some compromise,&#8221; he said, but in recent negotiations &#8220;the U.S. position keeps changing all the time, so we don&#8217;t know exactly what the U.S. would want as priorities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese government, he said, is willing to take steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, which is a central complaint of President Trump. He asserted that China is also willing to commit to &#8220;reforms&#8221; to China&#8217;s economy, where state-supported firms often compete for business with built-in advantages against foreign competitors. The U.S., he said, must clarify what it wants. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;More than once&#8221; in recent months, the ambassador said, &#8220;we had some tentative agreement between the two working teams, then just overnight, the tentative agreement was rejected, and the demand from the U.S. changed. So this is very confusing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>White House officials have not described China as so accommodating. In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/09\/18\/649089105\/white-house-adviser-navarro-on-why-hit-china-with-more-tariffs\">interview last month on NPR<\/a>, presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro insisted that ending the trade war &#8220;is all up to China,&#8221; and that &#8220;if China stops their unfair trade practices, it&#8217;s over.&#8221; Navarro said China &#8220;basically cheat[s] us,&#8221; and he repeated demands that have been made, with little success, by administrations from both parties, such as better protection of intellectual property rights in China. The U.S. especially wants China to allow American firms to do business there without being forced to share technology.<\/p>\n<p>Ambassador Cui said he, like other diplomats, has tried every means to better understand Trump. Deeming U.S. policy statements inconsistent (&#8220;If people tell you one story one day and a different story a different day, then you&#8217;re confused&#8221;), he has turned to the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\">president&#8217;s Twitter feed<\/a>. &#8220;If it&#8217;s written by the president, it has to be meaningful,&#8221; Cui said.<\/p>\n<p>China&#8217;s chief diplomat also obtained the Bob Woodward book <em>Fear, <\/em>which chronicled chaos and dysfunction in the White House. &#8220;I certainly have a copy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have talked to many other ambassadors here. We all share the same concern. All of us want to have a better understanding of what is happening here, and what it would mean for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cui urged the White House not to follow up on a reported idea to bar Chinese students from American universities, which he called &#8220;very dangerous,&#8221; saying that &#8220;people-to-people contacts&#8221; offer a &#8220;foundation of friendship.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But he demurred when asked if China would allow more openness: welcoming more journalists or scholars to sensitive areas of his country, such as the Xinjiang region, home to majority-Muslim Uighurs, and traditionally Buddhist Tibet.<\/p>\n<p>Xinjiang, he insisted, faces a threat of &#8220;terrorism,&#8221; while journalists must stay away from Tibet because of its &#8220;very high altitude.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2018 NPR.

Joseph Weidknecht showed up with pro-Trump signs and a Make America Great Again hat.<\/p>\n<p>At StoryCorps, they remember the moment that brought them together.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I noticed you, with the hat, and I noticed that you were surrounded by some people, and I noticed that they were being kind of threatening,&#8221; says Amdeen, now 21.<\/p>\n<p>The people surrounding him were wearing masks, she says.<\/p>\n<p>Weidknecht, now 26, who went to the rally by himself, was one of the few Trump supporters in attendance. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I heard a click of a lighter right behind my ear, and there were about three people trying to light my shirt on fire with lighters,&#8221; Weidknecht says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And then somebody snatched your hat off your head,&#8221; Amdeen says. &#8220;And that&#8217;s the point where &#8230; something kind of snapped inside of me because I wear a Muslim hijab, and I&#8217;ve been in situations where people have tried to snatch it off my head. And I rushed towards you and I just started screaming &#8216;Leave him alone! Give me that back!&#8217; &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>Though Amdeen was unsuccessful in retrieving the hat, Weidknecht says he was grateful that she stepped in to defend him.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we could be any further apart as people, and yet, it was just kinda like this common &#8216;that&#8217;s not OK&#8217; moment,&#8221; Weidknecht says. <\/p>\n<p>Police arrested one person involved in the altercation with Weidknecht. Others were also arrested at the rally for other offenses, though for the most part, the protest were peaceful.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You are genuinely the only Muslim person I know. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve actively avoided, it&#8217;s just, I&#8217;ve just never been in the position where I can interact for an extended period of time,&#8221; Weidknecht says.<\/p>\n<p>Up until meeting Amdeen, Weidknecht says his view of the Muslim community was influenced by news articles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like a lot of times in the media you don&#8217;t see the normal Muslims, the ones who listen to classic rock, like I do. You don&#8217;t meet that Muslim,&#8221; Amdeen says.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/storycorps.org\/discover\/one-small-step\/\">One Small Step interviews<\/a>, StoryCorps encourages people with differing political views to learn about the person behind the political label, and so Weidknecht asks her to tell him about herself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was born in Baghdad, Iraq. I moved to the U.S. when I was 10 years old,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Being a Muslim girl, I stood out in almost every single way that you can, in middle school, the worst time to stand out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Weidknecht says that having been home-schooled, he can relate. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a vastly different experience [than most people]. Socially, I didn&#8217;t have I guess as many friends as most people would,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>He says he has lost friends since the election because of some of his political views. &#8220;So I hope that I can be the reason that someone decides to talk to someone as opposed to just cutting them out of their life, or blocking them on Twitter,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like for this to encourage other people to engage in more conversations with people that you don&#8217;t agree with,&#8221; Amdeen says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is all about,&#8221; Weidknecht says. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I wasn&#8217;t the only one who felt like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Audio produced for <\/em>Morning Edition<em> by Kelly Moffitt.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>StoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.

Storm is an anchor at ESPN&#8217;s <em>SportsCenter <\/em>and Kremer, an award recipient of the Pro Football Hall of Fame for broadcasting, is a correspondent at the NFL Network.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition&#8217;s <\/em>Rachel Martin, Storm responded.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s extremely myopic to think that &#8230; the NFL or really any sport is only for men,&#8221; she says. <\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><h3><strong>Interview Highlights<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>On the significance of the moment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two women have never called an NFL game, much less an entire season. So we&#8217;re actually calling 11 games on Thursday night football, and I think it&#8217;s something whose time has come, but something that feels forward thinking as well. <\/p>\n<p><strong>On criticism that women don&#8217;t make good sports commentators<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny, for some reason sports has been considered like this bastion of male superiority or some kind of secret language that women couldn&#8217;t understand. And the NFL in particular, you know, the broadcasts are extremely technical and to some men and women it kind of sounds like they&#8217;re speaking a different language. I think that the rap if you will against women &#8230; is &#8220;Oh, well, they didn&#8217;t play football,&#8221; which is absolutely ridiculous. If you are smart, if you&#8217;re a good communicator, if you&#8217;re very, very hard working and you do your homework, you can learn anything. <\/p>\n<p><strong>On bringing her own perspective to sportscasting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Amazon wanted to hire us; not two women as a gimmick. They specifically wanted to hire me and Andrea because of our years of experience; the breadth of what we do. I cover all sports. Andrea&#8217;s in the Hall of Fame for football. It&#8217;s a perspective of what we think is interesting. So it&#8217;s not maybe the traditional play-by-play, x&#8217;s and o&#8217;s, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go down to the sideline.&#8217; This is that but it&#8217;s a lot of storytelling mixed in.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really what fascinates me; that&#8217;s the reason I got into sports. What makes these people tick, you know? What makes them achieve at such a high level? What do they overcome?<\/p>\n<p>So we don&#8217;t feel that we necessarily have to describe every single thing that you&#8217;re seeing on TV as we&#8217;re talking. We might be having a discussion, and you know, we&#8217;ll also catch you up on the action but you&#8217;re also watching it so you can see it with your eyes. <\/p>\n<p><strong>On what to expect Thursday night when the Los Angeles Rams play the Minnesota Vikings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So the Rams are a total juggernaut. They&#8217;ve got so much talent on both sides of the ball \u2014 top five offense and defense. And Minnesota is coming off this really embarrassing, huge upset at home to the Buffalo Bills. So now they&#8217;re going to roll into L.A. Coliseum with this team that&#8217;s on an absolute high \u2013 that some people are saying is the best team in football. So two incredible coaches, so many storylines and its going to be a blast.<\/p>\n<p><em>Reena Advani and Jacob Pinter edited and produced this story for broadcast. <\/em>  <\/p>\n<div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2018 NPR.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes, I wrote and led the effort to continue and fund the current pilot program through the end of FY25 until we can consider a more permanent or expanded program in FY26. The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We made a significant investment in both the operating and capital budgets for ACPS in the FY25 budget allocating over $8 million in new revenue to ACPS out of $11.75 million in new revenue. In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes. These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the long run, property taxes are a terrible way to fund education. If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes. Along with public safety, our schools are our biggest budget priority and they will be a major focus for me on the City Council<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Lewis\"><\/a>James Lewis<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049092\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049092\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-900x675.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1600x1200.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>James Lewis.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy James Lewis campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>James Lewis is a lobbyist for a professional organization for pharmacists working with elderly patients.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding. We need to leverage the unique opportunities available to AHRA and our industrial development authority because we cannot keep waiting for Richmond to fund these needed projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I believe Zoning for Housing was a step in the right direction but much more must be done. Nothing in Z4H ensures that developers build the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d workforce housing or affordable housing. It\u2019s imperative that members of Council use their votes on each and every project to ensure that each project benefits Alexandria and meets the needs of our community members.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

When I look at the City budget, I am constantly reminded the local government is responsible for three major areas: public safety, infrastructure and education. We must do these things well because no other level of government can address them or provide the needed investments. Our schools must be fully funded.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#McPike\"><\/a>Kirk McPike<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049097\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049097\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Kirk McPike.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Kirk McPike campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kirk McPike is a current member of the City Council.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of the roughly $11 million the city would gain from a 2.5 cent increase in property taxes, the council will send $8.7 million to ACPS \u2014 $4.7 million for capital contributions and $4 million for the operating budget. This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
