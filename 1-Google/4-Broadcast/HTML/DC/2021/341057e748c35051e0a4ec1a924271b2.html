Margaret Barthel breaks down the issues in the gubernatorial race, and the races to watch in Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince William counties.<\/p>\n<p>The polls are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., but as long as you are in line by 7 p.m., you will be able to vote. Look up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elections.virginia.gov\/casting-a-ballot\/polling-place-lookup\/\">your polling place here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what else you should know about today\u2019s election.<\/p>\n<h4>The governor\u2019s race is extremely tight, and it\u2019s being closely watched<\/h4>\n<p>One of only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/10\/31\/1050563878\/heres-why-the-other-48-states-care-whos-governor-of-virginia-and-new-jersey\">two states<\/a> to hold statewide elections the year after a presidential election, Virginia is seen as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/10\/11\/politics\/virginia-governor-race-joe-biden-terry-mcauliffe-glenn-youngkin\/index.html\">a litmus test for a president\u2019s administration<\/a> \u2014 particularly in their first year in office. Many analysts believe this year\u2019s election will be an indicator of whether Democrats will be able to maintain control of Congress in next year\u2019s midterms.<\/p>\n<p>The gubernatorial race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin will mark the first high-profile electoral battle since the 2020 presidential election. McAuliffe, who won a tight election in 2013 following President Barack Obama\u2019s second-term victory, is facing razor-thin margins against Youngkin.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2021\/10\/29\/virginia-polls-democrats\/\">Most of the latest polls<\/a> show them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2021\/governor\/va\/virginia_governor_youngkin_vs_mcauliffe-7373.html\">neck and neck<\/a>, though Fox News has Youngkin up by 8 points. That poll remains an outlier, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2021\/10\/29\/virginia-polls-democrats\/\">according to the Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats swept control of the General Assembly in 2019, marking an historic blue wave in the commonwealth and giving the party power in the legislature and governor\u2019s mansion. Now, they are fighting to hang on to both the governorship and the House of Delegates. High-profile party leadership \u2014 think Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris, and President Joe Biden \u2014 have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2021\/oct\/23\/barack-obama-terry-mcauliffe-campaign-virginia-governor\">made their pitch to Virginians<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Republicans have been testing messaging and approaches to winning in a post-Donald Trump world. While Youngkin \u2014 an extremely wealthy venture capitalist \u2014 seemed cut from the same Brooks Brothers cloth as Mitt Romney, he\u2019s taken a hard tack on cultural issues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo his Republican supporters, whether or not it\u2019s an act isn\u2019t really the point,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/10\/29\/us\/politics\/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governors-race.html\">the New York Times recently explained<\/a> in a story outlining Youngkin\u2019s upward trajectory in the race. \u201cAs long as Mr. Youngkin is saying what they want to hear and signaling what they understand he cannot say out loud \u2014 running on the issue of \u2018election integrity,\u2019 for instance, rather than wholeheartedly accepting Mr. Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud in 2020 \u2014 many conservatives see his campaign as providing a template for how to delicately embrace Trumpism in blue states.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>No matter how it ends, the lieutenant governor race will be historic<\/h4>\n<p>Either Del. Hala Ayala (D-Prince William County) or Winsome Sears (R) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pilotonline.com\/government\/elections\/dp-nw-elex-lg-20211025-oyjdtcczhbdcpddl7g5jpda7bq-story.html\">will make history<\/a> as the first woman and first woman of color to hold the commonwealth\u2019s second-highest office.<\/p>\n<p>The lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, can break tie votes on most bills, though they cannot do so in state budgets, and the position does not have the power to introduce legislation. Current Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) has cast 52 tie-breaking votes in his role, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/campaign\/579172-virginia-set-to-elect-first-woman-of-color-for-lieutenant-governor\">The Hill<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ayala won election to Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates in 2017, where she rose through the ranks to serve <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/21\/10\/08\/the-politics-hour-october-8-2021\/\">as deputy whip<\/a>, helping to push through a raft of Democratic-led legislation. Sears served as a one-term delegate in the General Assembly representing Hampton Roads two decades ago. Most recently, she served as national chairperson for Black Americans to Re-Elect President Trump, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/ayala-or-sears-both-would-make-history-in-virginia-election\/2021\/10\/23\/7c05f724-33f5-11ec-8036-7db255bff176_story.html\">The Washington Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Loudoun County has become a flashpoint<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andrewdepietro\/2021\/03\/08\/the-richest-counties-in-the-us-by-state\/?sh=58ac371a6a2a\">One of the wealthiest counties<\/a> in the nation, Loudoun County has found itself <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/10\/29\/loudoun-county-early-voting-site-local-national-politics-collide\/\">in the national spotlight<\/a> amid a series of battles centered around its public school system.<\/p>\n<p>School board meetings, typically held for budget discussions and recognizing high-achieving students, became <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/21\/07\/15\/loudoun-county-schools-are-grappling-with-racism-and-garnering-national-attention\/\">viral political flashpoints<\/a> marked by anger, chaos, and <a href=\"https:\/\/loudounnow.com\/2021\/08\/05\/public-will-have-restricted-access-to-loudoun-school-board-meetings\/\">new restrictions on who can attend<\/a>. Most recently, LCPS\u2019s handling of two alleged sexual assaults in its schools sparked another media frenzy and renewed parental criticism around the system\u2019s equity initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, coronavirus closures, curriculums on equity and racism, protections for transgender students, and other education issues in the Northerm Virginia county <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/10\/25\/loudoun-county-in-virginia-governors-race-culture-wars\/\">have been weaponized<\/a> in the election, Colleen Grablick writes.<\/p>\n<p>Conservatives particularly have focused on \u201ccritical race theory\u201d \u2014\u00a0which the school system repeatedly has said is not part of the curriculum \u2014\u00a0and equity issues beyond the classroom, including protections for transgender students. Youngkin has seized on the controversies, rallying crowds with the phrase \u201cparents matter.\u201d Meanwhile, students, the local NAACP, and even Virginia\u2019s attorney general have called for Loudoun County Public Schools to correct systemic racial discrimination within their facilities.<\/p>\n<h4>Poll watchers say the election is secure<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s a process that officials say largely has remained the same for many, many years. But this year, elections officials say there\u2019s been a renewed interest in observing elections processes at work \u2014 particularly when it comes to poll watching.<\/p>\n<p>Scott Konopasek, head of elections in Virginia\u2019s Fairfax County, tells Martin Austermuhle that he has seen a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/10\/28\/virginia-election-officials-say-voting-is-secure-despite-fraud-claims\/\">marked increase in the number of election observers<\/a> and poll watchers this year. He fears that part of that rise can be attributed to distrust born out of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2021\/10\/27\/virginia-poll-watchers-election\/\">unsubstantiated and ongoing claims of election fraud<\/a> during last year\u2019s election and repeated demands from many Republicans for \u201celection integrity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Youngkin has particularly campaigned on the issue, saying things like \u201cI think we need to make sure that people trust these voting machines\u201d at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2021\/10\/06\/youngkin-election-audit-virginia-governor\/\">recent forum<\/a> and calling for an audit of voting machines (nevermind that the Department of Elections already does so).<\/p>\n<p>For their part, Virginia elections officials have tried to reassure voters that <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/10\/27\/after-historic-voting-reforms-virginians-have-unprecedented-access-to-the-polls\/\">their ballots<\/a> will be safe and secure.

Under Curfew, Public Emergency","content":"<p>The U.S. Capitol was thrown into violent disarray Wednesday afternoon as insurrectionists in support of President Donald Trump breached the building and sowed chaos inside.<\/p>\n<p>Four people died on the Capitol grounds, including a woman fatally shot by U.S. Capitol Police and three others who died of apparent medical emergencies, according to Robert Contee, the acting chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. residents had been warned by elected officials to stay away from the rallies scheduled during the week to protest Congress certifying Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. The Proud Boys, an extremist group of self-described \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d with ties to white supremacy, threatened <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2021\/01\/05\/parler-telegram-violence-dc-protests\/\">violence and destruction in the city ahead of <\/a>the events. Two previous MAGA rallies held in D.C. in the wake of the 2020 election saw stabbings and other altercations.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous local officials have raised concerns about a response by Capitol Police they deemed underprepared and inadequate.<\/p>\n<p>Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen, who chairs the committee that oversees D.C.\u2019s police department, called the Capitol Police response a \u201ccomplete failure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMPD has gone in to help support. But what we\u2019re watching is nothing short of domestic terrorists, an attempt at a coup, and sedition,\u201d said Allen. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how there wasn\u2019t a better preparation for what we\u2019re seeing take place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After lawmakers went into lockdown or were evacuated, D.C. police took the lead in clearing the Capitol building of insurrectionists, with the help of a series of local law enforcement agencies on the scene to assist. In response to the scenes of violent chaos, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayorbowser\/status\/1346902298044325893?s=21\">ordered<\/a> a 6 p.m. curfew. (Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GovernorVA\/status\/1346947694921723904\">declared a 6 p.m. curfew<\/a> in Arlington County and the City of Alexandria and issued a state of emergency in Virginia.)<\/p>\n<p>By late Wednesday evening, D.C. police had arrested 52 people \u2014 47 of those arrests were related to curfew violations and unlawful entry, and half of the total arrests occurred on U.S. Capitol grounds, according to Contee. He said that police began enforcing the curfew order at the Capitol and then fanned out to other parts of the city, and would continue to enforce it until it ended at 6 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Officials are releasing images of people who breached the Capitol to make sure they are \u201cheld accountable for the carnage,\u201d Bowser said.<\/p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers have also recovered weapons including two pipe bombs in downtown D.C. near the Republican National Committee headquarters and Democratic National Committee headquarters, as well as a cooler with Molotov cocktails discovered in a vehicle on the Capitol grounds.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"slideshow-caption\">Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington.

The session was halted in the middle of debate over the results in Arizona, and Capitol Police proceeded to try to lock down the building.<\/p>\n<p>Police were unable to secure the building: After successfully breaking through a barricade, one group clashed with Capitol Police on the Capitol steps. Police deployed chemical irritants in an attempt to control the crowd. Inside the building, pro-Trump extremists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates\/2021\/01\/06\/954028436\/u-s-capitol-locked-down-amid-escalating-far-right-protests\">were seen<\/a> wandering in the House and Senate floors, smashing windows, and occupying offices.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of the building, protesters chanted to push forward, while individuals climbed walls around the Capitol campus. Others paraded large American flags through the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>A haze of smoke obscured the building as Capitol Police used what appeared to be chemical irritants and flash bangs to clear extremists from the steps and nearby scaffolding. The crowd yelled back at police, shouting, \u201cTraitors! Traitors!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Officers with D.C. police arrived at the scene in riot gear shortly thereafter, and law enforcement succeeded in clearing protesters entirely off the Capitol lawn shortly before 6 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The D.C. National Guard was deployed after an initial delay. The governors of Virginia and Maryland both sent in National Guard troops and state troops. Police officers from Fairfax County and Prince George\u2019s County were also in the District to assist with the response, according to DCist\/WAMU reporters on the scene. Police officers from Baltimore County were also deployed on Wednesday afternoon to help, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BaltCoExec\/status\/1346933849024917507\">County Executive Johnny Olszewski<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back, you fucking traitors,\u201d one insurrectionist yelled toward authorities as they cleared the area around the Capitol.<\/p>\n<p>At 7:30 p.m., nearly an hour and a half into the District-wide curfew, a crowd dozens strong remained on Pennsylvania Ave. Hundreds of law enforcement officers, some of whom appeared to be members of the National Guard and FBI, began encircling the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>As law enforcement officers let people exit the kettle, one man shouted: \u201cFucking pig cocksuckers, we\u2019re coming back with rifles next time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Multiple local officials have criticized the Capitol Police for what they saw as an initially tepid response to the riots.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a complete disgrace,\u201d Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George wrote on Twitter. \u201cOver the summer we saw federal law enforcement use tear gas, flash bangs, and rubber bullets on Black Lives Matter protesters without provocation. Where are the riot squads now? Are they standing down as white supremacists attempt a coup?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ward 8 Councilmember Trayon White also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/trayonwhite\/status\/1346825160339431425\/photo\/1\">wrote a letter to Bowser<\/a> questioning whether D.C. police were being as diligent about surveilling for potential illegal guns among right-wing protesters as they are about surveilling D.C. residents.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine also criticized federal law enforcement\u2019s lack of preparedness for the day\u2019s violence.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe social media made it clear as far as to what was going to occur,\u201d Racine said in an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewsHour\/status\/1346955097025241089\">interview with PBS NewsHour<\/a>, in an apparent reference to the violent threats <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2021\/01\/05\/parler-telegram-violence-dc-protests\/\">documented on pro-Trump and far-right forums<\/a> in rtecent days. Racine said the police reaction was a stark contrast to the response to protests against police killings of Black people over the summer, when federal law enforcement from multiple agencies mobilized to protect the U.S. Capitol \u201cfor no reason when there was a peaceful protest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At-large Councilmember Christina Henderson, who worked on the Hill for four years before her current role, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chenderson\/status\/1346905065416753152\">wrote on Twitter<\/a> that she had seen the U.S. Capitol Police \u201cuse more force with protesters in wheelchairs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bowser said she observed some differences between federal agencies\u2019 treatment of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square, who were tear gassed, and the insurrectionists at the Capitol. \u201cWe saw a different type of vehicles used,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw a different posture used in some cases. We did not see, for example, deployment of those military personnel on the Capitol grounds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Late in the evening, the mayor extended the public emergency she declared in the District for an additional 15 days, a timespan that includes the presidential inauguration. That allows her to more easily corral resources for public safety.<\/p>\n<p>She, like many local officials, has insisted that Trump be held accountable for the day\u2019s events.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomsherwood\/status\/1346982463378255872\">Racine<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlesallen\/status\/1346985775448154112\">Allen<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchi.mp\/dccouncil\/councilmember-kenyan-mcduffie-condemns-insurrection-by-trump-supporters-at-us-capitol?e=416b608650\">Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie<\/a> have joined a <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/532988-democratic-lawmakers-call-for-pence-to-invoke-25th-amendment-remove\">chorus of Democratic members of Congress<\/a> in calling for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office.

It was the most relaxed Afridi said he has felt in D.C. since Trump became president.<\/p>\n<p>Afridi, who is Muslim, said he and his family have lived in fear because the Trump administration has sown hostility toward people of color and certain ethnic groups. The Trump administration has banned nearly all travelers or immigrants from five majority-Muslim countries, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, in addition to North Korea and Venezuela. Critics of the ban have pointed to Trump\u2019s many negative remarks about Islam as proof of bias.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are here to tell Biden, \u2018sir, we are so happy that you are here,\u2019\u201d Afridi said of the former vice president. \u201cFor the last four years, we\u2019ve felt very unsafe in this country because of Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Afridi spoke, his 7-year-old son, Abdullah interjected.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are looking for peace, not terror,\u201d the boy said.<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to

p.m. Tuesday night to make it to the Supreme Court by 6 a.m. Wednesday morning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI own my own business and I owe everything to her,\u201d Miles says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a strong, independent, female role model growing up so I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s who she was for me. Now that she\u2019s gone, I just feel profound sadness for what we\u2019ve lost, what I\u2019ve lost, what our country has lost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The crowd featured a mix of children \u2014 including Ashley-Lauren Schreiber\u2019s six-month-old daughter, Wells, who donned a dissent collar in honor of the justice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe just thought it was really important to bring her out here to say that she was here,\u201d says Schreiber, who lives in Richmond. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that she knew that we cared enough to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Attorney Joelle Gotwals brought her 8-year-old daughter Neva to pay respects on Wednesday, taking a break from Neva\u2019s virtual school day to share the historic moment together and to honor Ginsburg\u2019s \u201cstrength and dignity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg has always been both a personal and a professional hero of mine,\u201d Gotwals says, holding back tears. \u201c[My daughter] is a fan, not only of the late Justice Ginsburg, but also Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and it\u2019s something that she and I share together. It was important for us to be here today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Others visiting the Supreme Court expressed that Ginsburg\u2019s death was almost too momentous to fully understand. Kat Kelly-Chung, a Baltimore-area resident, has never attended the viewing of a prominent leader, and says that paying respect to the justice on Wednesday felt too deep to put into words.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems so surreal,\u201d says Kelly-Chung. \u201cI think I need to be here because I just don\u2019t believe that she\u2019s really gone.This one has been a hard one for me to even put any of my thoughts or emotions into words, into expression.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Kelly-Chung says she\u2019s scared for the country with the \u201cheart wrenching\u201d passing of Ginsburg, she also says she hopes that the loss inspires a new generation of leaders to carry out the justice\u2019s legacy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do have a lot of hope in our young adults right now, and I think they\u2019re going to have the potential to shift things, not just here but in the world,\u201d Kelly-Chung says. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been living on the wrong side of the coin and they\u2019re ready to flip it. And I\u2019m looking forward to all of that \u2014 even the struggles that come with that.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-1500x999.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-23-1600x1066.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg's casket was carried into the high court around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-1500x999.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-251-1600x1066.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg's casket was carried into the high court around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-1500x999.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-232-1600x1066.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg's casket was carried into the high court around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-1500x999.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/PHOTO-2020-09-23-09-50-231-2-1600x1066.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg's casket was carried into the high court around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday morning. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Around 9:30 a.m., the justice was carried into the court\u2019s Great Hall where close family and justices held a special memorial ceremony. Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt and Chief Justice John Roberts spoke of Ginsburg\u2019s contributions to the country, her family, and the court.<\/p>\n<p>Crowds, meanwhile, continued to grow outside, weaving through the maze of gates leading up to the building as members of the public prepared for the viewing. D.C. native Rick Roy, a longtime employee tasked with cleaning the Supreme Court building (he says the justice<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DaniellaCheslow\/status\/1308814487726759942\"> was always tidy<\/a>) sold \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d shirts to those gathering for a place in line. Melissa Byrne, a representative with a court justice advocacy organization, handed out free face masks to the crowd, printed with the words \u201chonor her wish.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted to do something that fit the occasion, and everybody needs to wear masks because we protect each other,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cAnd all of this court work is a form of protecting each other as well. [Giving out masks is] a simple way to honor her wish.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Southern Virginia resident Brianna Martinez was among one of the hundreds waiting to pay their respects by mid-morning. Martinez drove more than three hours (plus a 45-minute Metro train ride) to make it to the court on Wednesday. She says being surrounded by hundreds of others honoring Ginsburg made the trip worthwhile \u2014 no matter how long it took.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt means a lot being with a bunch of people who also recognize her legacy, and the monumental person \u2014 not just in jurisprudence, but in social justice, feminism, women\u2019s rights, human rights. It feels important to be here, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t care how far the drive or how long I had to wait in line. I just wanted to show up for her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The justice\u2019s casket will lie in repose under the Portico at the top of the building\u2019s front steps for members of the public to view outside from about 11 a.m. to until 10 p.m. Wednesday, and from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>After that, Ginsburg will be the first woman and first Jewish person to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Ginsburg will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery next week.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a

The second person escaped.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. police shared an image of a gun and said it belonged to Kay.<\/p>\n<p>Police said they arrested two other people: Marcyelle Smith, 19, was charged with carrying a firearm without a license and Deonte Brown, 19, was charged with \u201cno permit,\u201d which <a href=\"https:\/\/code.dccouncil.us\/dc\/council\/code\/sections\/16-801.html#\">appears to refer to operating a vehicle without a license<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement the officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard under the department\u2019s policy.<\/p>\n<p>D.C.

Marks Juneteenth With Protests, Music, Memory","content":"<p>Locals across the D.C. region marked the Juneteenth holiday with protests, joy, art, and service.<\/p>\n<p>Neighbors checked in on neighbors. People danced to go-go music and made art at Black Lives Matter Plaza. Educators marched for better schools for Black and Brown children. Parents and children reflected on family and family traditions. Drum lines beat out rhythms in front of the White House. And hundreds of protesters \u2014 with protests now entering a fourth consecutive week \u2014 vowed to keep showing up to demand an end to police violence and racism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are truths that we have, like \u2018white people have benefited from white supremacy.\u2019 To be able to say those truths \u2014 and then the next step is to take action \u2014 is really important,\u201d said Alisha Jaffe, a peace-building organizer.<\/p>\n<p>Rain showers and thunder didn\u2019t dampen the mood or decrease the crowds as the evening progressed. Around 11 p.m., a group of protesters on 3rd Street NW pulled down a statue of Albert Pike, the only statue of a Confederate general on public land in D.C.<\/p>\n<p>The day took on a range of emotional tones: grief, anger, determination, and joy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a barbecue,\u201d said one organizer in a speech at the Lincoln Memorial, urging protesters to persist and organize. And yet, there were barbecues just blocks away at Black Lives Matter Plaza, where people who prepared the food said they wanted to contribute to the movement by keeping protesters fed.<\/p>\n<p>Demonstrations coalesced in various parts of the city, each with its own focus. Several were under the banner of the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), which is demanding that cities divest from policing and redirect funds toward community-based programs. Others, like Don\u2019t Mute DC\u2019s go-go celebration, coalesced around demands related to criminal justice reform and the needs of the formerly incarcerated \u2014 but were also about celebrating the city\u2019s homegrown Black art, go-go, and claiming space for Black people born and raised in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when the Union army arrived in Galveston, Texas with news of the emancipation of enslaved people, which had taken effect in 1863. The holiday is recognized by 46 states and the District. For many, it\u2019s a day for family, food, and truth-telling about the history and resilience of Black people in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>That was the case for Tamara Davis Brown and her 20-year-old daughter Jessica, who visited Black Lives Matter Plaza early in the afternoon. Brown, of Clinton, Maryland, grew up in Texas and remembers celebrating Juneteenth with a big family reunion and a history lesson from her elders. She was excited that the Black Lives Matter protests meant more people marking the day outside of Texas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat better day and what better way to celebrate Juneteenth?\u201d Brown said. She and her daughter planned to hang their handmade signs \u2014 Brown\u2019s carried the name of her late father \u2014 on a fence nearby, a recognition that their family was part of what felt like a historic moment.<\/p>\n<p>In the morning, one group of activists in Southeast D.C. marked the day with a \u201cWalk of Love\u201d to check in on their neighbors. The volunteer group went door to door, armed with purple gift bags stuffed with hand sanitizer, lip balm, crossword puzzle books, printouts with mindfulness exercises, a 40-question community needs assessment, and information about the coronavirus and the 2020 census.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people are living in their own silos, especially in this pandemic,\u201d said Beverly Smith-Brown, the founder of Momma\u2019s Safe Haven in Ward 8. Her community support organization co-led the event along with the Alliance of Concerned Men and Serve Your City. \u201cI think spreading love is one of the most important things we can do at this time,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of educators gathered at Freedom Plaza and marched to the U.S. Department of Education building in Southwest D.C., shouting \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d and \u201cBlack kids deserve more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Educators for Equity, the grassroots organization that organized the rally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsforequity.com\/causes\">made five demands<\/a> to D.C. Public Schools, including redirecting money from school resource officers to mental health resources and revising the curriculum to accurately reflect Black history and the histories of other people of color.<\/p>\n<p>Nandi Taylor, a fifth-grade teacher at Anita J. Turner Elementary School in Southeast said the group started two weeks ago to address the needs of Black students. Taylor said the presence of police officers in school is harmful to students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to do more, to be proactive to help our students deal with problems, instead of reacting with violence,\u201d she said. \u201cReacting with violence incites violence and we need to break the cycle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Late in the afternoon, protesters gathered at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture and marched to the Lincoln Memorial, in what organizers said they hoped would be the first annual <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/freedom-day-march-on-juneteenth-tickets-109206732276\">Freedom Day March<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2.jpeg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-1500x999.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-900x600.jpeg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.56-PM-2-1600x1066.jpeg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Washingtonian Dominique Jackson stands with an \u201cAM I NEXT?\u201d poster.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-1500x999.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-900x600.jpeg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-06-19-at-8.18.57-PM-1-1600x1066.jpeg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Li (goes by one name), an artist from Gaithersburg, Md., draws chalk figures on the ground around people on H Street near the White House.

and K Street.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Some marchers were thoughtful about contextualizing the celebratory notes of Juneteenth with the ongoing struggle for justice and equality for Black people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a block party,\u201d said organizer Morgan Barnhart. \u201cThis is a protest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Morgan Sills, a Howard University law student, saw the protests as a way to deliver on Juneteenth\u2019s promise of emancipation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in that fight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in that struggle for full citizenship, for full protections of the law.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, in Silver Spring, hundreds marched to demand the defunding of police, investments in Black communities, and the resignation of President Donald Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Art, music, food, and fellowship flowed at Black Lives Matter Plaza in the afternoon and into the evening. The Silver Starlet Dance Team from Temple Hills, Md., took over the plaza for a dance performance. Another woman danced with lit sparklers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CBdFSawhTOh\/?igshid=1vfw504koug40\">Don\u2019t Mute DC<\/a>, an organization that grew out of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/04\/09\/this-is-the-sound-of-florida-and-georgia-avenue-go-go-fans-are-trying-to-bring-the-music-back-to-metro-pcs\/\">last spring\u2019s debate<\/a> over whether a MetroPCS store in Shaw could play go-go music over its sidewalk loudspeakers, set up an afternoon of go-go music. Don\u2019t Mute DC organizers put together a march starting at the MetroPCS store and ending at Black Lives Matter Plaza. They also organized other events, including a rally with D.C.\u2019s legendary Backyard Band, a virtual town hall on mass incarceration, and a virtual afterparty and DJ battle. Later in the evening, hundreds reconvened at 14th and U for Moechella, a protest-turned-block party and fireworks.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere at Black Lives Matter Plaza, people created visual art to celebrate the day and tell their stories. Nearby, at 16th and K, people threw clouds of red and green powdered paint into the air. On H Street, near Lafayette Square, an artist drew chalk outlines around people lying prone on the pavement. Further up the block, at one tent, some wrote down thoughts about their experiences of race on cards.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhite supremacy is your privilege not to know us,\u201d one card read. \u201cTo know us is a Bonus. For Us to know You is Survival.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Under a tent, a drum line played while people colored and drew on big sheets of paper. Nadine Chadrien looked on while her daughter Lila colored.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSlavery didn\u2019t go away, it just changed forms,\u201d Lila said. \u201cPolice brutality is a form a slavery.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At 8 p.m., Black Lives Matter D.C. organized a march on the White House. Demonstrators chanted \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d and \u201cIf we don\u2019t get it, shut it down!\u201d and vowed to keep protesting until they won meaningful policy change.<\/p>\n<p>More than three weeks ago, protests against police brutality began along the south side of Lafayette Square, facing the White House, but were pushed back \u2014 at times by tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades \u2014 to the north side of the square and then 16th Street. The<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/09\/park-service-plans-to-remove-some-of-the-fencing-around-the-white-house-on-wednesday\/\"> temporary fences blocking off Lafayette Park came down last week<\/a>, and there is now additional black fencing surrounding the White House.<\/p>\n<p>At around 11:30 p.m., a group of protesters marched past the Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters and on to the corner of 3rd and D St NW, where they tore down the statue of Confederate general, Albert Pike, and set a fire on it.<\/p>\n<p>The statue is the only one of a Confederate general in D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, more than half the D.C. Council, and the D.C. attorney general have <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/08\/15\/confederate-statue-councilmember\/\">previously called for the statue to be removed<\/a> from the federal land it sits on.<\/p>\n<p>Police did not intervene as the crowd pulled down the statue. That provoked <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1274182502421315584\">an angry tweet from President Trump<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Across the city, it was a day of considering \u2014 and reconsidering \u2014 history. Chris Guandique, who attended the protest at the Lincoln Memorial, hadn\u2019t known what Juneteenth was two weeks ago. But the holiday\u2019s social justice significance resonated with him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing that [Juneteenth] did represent the last remaining slaves being freed, I feel like that represents a majority of America a lot more than just July 4th.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a

to find themselves swept up by another moving in a different direction. The masses were able to orient and organize themselves in part because <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/05\/d-c-s-street-plan-is-a-monument-to-democracy\/\">the city\u2019s street grid was built<\/a> to create clear vistas to the city\u2019s monuments and government buildings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were wondering what a decentralized protest looks like, and, well, this is what it looks like,\u201d a protester named Lauren told DCist at around 3 in the afternoon.

for the day's demonstrations.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<p>By 8:00 p.m, the various marches that started around the city converged at the plaza. The crowd of several thousand people was tightly packed, and while most people wore masks, it was impossible to maintain any semblance of social distance. D.C. is still in the throes of a pandemic\u2014on Saturday, the District, Maryland, and Virginia <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/01\/coronavirus-latest-d-c-maryland-virginia-week-of-june-1\/\">reported 1,645 total new cases<\/a> of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of St. John\u2019s Church, Reggie Guy continued giving out free food at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Curious_Kurz\/status\/1269408482551369736\">Earl\u2019s First Amendment Grill<\/a>, a pop-up hot dog stand that started as a two-person operation three days ago. Now, Earl\u2019s is a two-tent setup with over $1,000 in food and equipment, and chairs for protesters to rest and eat.<\/p>\n<p>Guy said he started the pop-up earlier this week as a way to keep protesters motivated, and to keep them coming back out again and again.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI came out here, they were hungry, I was hungry. And that was a reason for me to go home,\u201d Guys said. \u201cSo I was like, if this is making me want to go home, I know I can do something to help right there\u2014food and chairs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brittany Bellany, 28, told DCist that the atmosphere outside the White House felt joyful and cathartic. \u201cIt\u2019s really celebratory. There\u2019s so many people out here helping each other, I don\u2019t really see any negative protests, any officers looking aggressive, not yet,\u201d Bellany said. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen a lot of love, a lot of support, a lot of volunteers passing out food and drinks and supplies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>MPD confirmed to DCist that it hadn\u2019t made any protester arrests as of 11 p.m. While there didn\u2019t appear to be any protester clashes with law enforcement on Saturday, uniformed law enforcement and national guardsmen could still be seen all over the city, as could the occasional humvee. The chain-link fence blocking access to public areas served as a reminder of the crackdown on protesters earlier in the week.<\/p>\n<p>But on Saturday, that fence \u2014 which has extended farther and farther over the course of this week \u2014 was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Curious_Kurz\/status\/1269399860341551106\">decorated<\/a> with calls for police reform and shrines to victims of police brutality. Phrases \u201cban stop and frisk\u201d and \u201cdefund MPD\u201d were strung throughout the chain-link barrier. The faces of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, and several other black people who have been killed by police<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rebtanhs\/status\/1269380939618148352\/photo\/1\"> were taped to a piece of cardboard<\/a> and fastened to the fence, with the words \u201cthey matter\u201d written above them.<\/p>\n<p>As night settled on the crowd, an activist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Curious_Kurz\/status\/1269443981378834433\">yelled into a bullhorn<\/a> to give those gathered a reminder of how the scene had changed: \u201cIf you were here last weekend, they had tear gas \u2026 they fucked us up. But we took these streets back.\u201d He then led the crowd in a chant of \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the giant crowd of protesters continued to chant and sing at Black Lives Matter Plaza, another group marched to the Lincoln Memorial, where they held a silent protest in honor of George Floyd.<\/p>\n<p>Dozens of people at the memorial lay on their stomachs for eight minutes and 46 seconds, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/abdallah_fayyad\/status\/1269445685813874689\">independent journalist Abdallah Fayyad reported<\/a>. That\u2019s the amount of time that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck as Floyd struggled to breathe.<\/p>\n<p>A third group split off from the White House and began a march back toward the Capitol, as has happened on several nights this week.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to continue <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/vicious-dogs-versus-a-scared-man-trump-feud-with-bowser-escalates-amid-police-brutality-protests\/2020\/06\/06\/f65d51c2-a812-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html\">his feud with the mayor<\/a> and the city of D.C.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMuch smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated,\u201d he tweeted about Saturday\u2019s massive crowds with at least <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/05\/d-c-is-preparing-for-saturdays-protests-with-street-closures-metro-adjustments\/\">10 separate protests across the city<\/a>. \u201cNational Guard, Secret Service, and D.C. Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trump went on to tweet on Saturday that CNN and MSNBC were<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1269452057737641984\"> attempting to \u201cinflame\u201d<\/a> the crowds, which at that point were continuing their calm, sometimes joyful, sometimes sorrowful demonstration on the plaza.<\/p>\n<p>As the night wore on, a crowd of protesters was determined to stay and send a message they hope will last beyond the protests that have rocked the city over the last week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat could have been me. That could have been my father. That could have been my brother,\u201d a protester named Daniel told DCist about Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to stand out here all night long.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This post has been

National Guard Saturday evening.<\/p>\n<p>At least one car was set on fire. Some demonstrators smashed windows on the facade of the Ronald Reagan Foundation and Institute. Fireworks went off on multiple occasions. Police and Secret Service pushed protesters back as the crowd moved again and again toward Lafayette Park, repeatedly using chemical sprays. As the night turned into the early morning, stores in several neighborhoods were looted.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Fire and EMS said they transported seven people to the hospital, though a spokesperson could not immediately say how many were protesters or law enforcement.\u00a0The D.C. Police Union said that at least one of its members <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DCPoliceUnion\/status\/1266956553950646273\">was hospitalized<\/a> after getting hit by a rock.<\/p>\n<p>Volunteers wearing red or white crosses on their clothes <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gbullard\/status\/1266909496800149507\">offered medical help<\/a>, checking for concussions and washing people\u2019s

Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/05\/30\/trump-assails-bowser-over-white-house-protests\/\">falsely accused Mayor Muriel Bowser of refusing to allow<\/a> D.C. police to help manage the previous night\u2019s protests, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1266711223657205763\">warned protesters<\/a> of \u201cominous weapons\u201d and \u201cvicious dogs\u201d on the other side of the White House fence.<\/p>\n<p>The demonstrations began peacefully with a car caravan that traveled from 16th Street Heights to downtown in the early afternoon.\u00a0Separately, hundreds of protesters marched from the U.S. Navy Memorial Plaza to the Capitol Building.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not violence, this is disruption of a prejudiced system,\u201d a speaker shouted to the crowd gathered in front of the Capitol.

As the multi-generational caravan drove down Benning Road through the H Street corridor, Capitol Hill, and Southwest D.C., people on the streets raised their fists, clapped their hands and waved in

class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile<strong>, <\/strong>clashes began near the White House, where law enforcement barricaded the entirety of Lafayette Square with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dbonessi\/status\/1266819618896781312\">black fences and yellow caution tape<\/a>. As the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aletweetsnews\/status\/1266844117654478851\">demonstration intensified<\/a>, Secret Service officers announced a final warning for protesters to disperse around 5:30 p.m. before releasing pepper spray.<\/p>\n<p>The demonstration continued to the corner in front of the Renwick Gallery, as protesters shouted, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot,\u201d and began <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dbonessi\/status\/1266823319791243265\/photo\/1\">climbing<\/a> on police cars.<\/p>\n<p>Confrontations continued later in the evening between police and protesters at 16th and H streets NW, where police pushed demonstrators back from behind barricades. The D.C. National Guard were deployed to the area as the sun began to set, joining Secret Service, D.C. police and U.S. Park Police in the area surrounding the White House.<\/p>\n<h4>\u2018It\u2019s Our Turn To Get Out\u2019<\/h4>\n<p>Early in the day, many protesters said they wanted the demonstrations to stay peaceful, but some also acknowledged the situation could get violent.<\/p>\n<p>Nicole, a resident of Northwest D.C. who declined to provide a last name, said that \u201cIf [riot police] get violent with us, it\u2019s okay for us to get violent with them. They already act like they\u2019re a gang, banging on their shields like they\u2019re getting ready to attack.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>District resident Rudi Easler participated in the protest from the fringes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid for these people, but at the same time, I\u2019m more afraid of the level of power police have in order to hurt and to silence all these people out here who are just trying to protect themselves and protect their community,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Getting close to the action is \u201cnot her personality,\u201d but Easler said she fully supported those who chose to engage more directly at the front of the barricades.<\/p>\n<p>One protester named Alexis said, \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to make our point peacefully with sit-ins. We\u2019ve been home quarantined for months as other people put their lives on the line. It\u2019s our turn to get out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her father, Joe, added, \u201cI don\u2019t support the violence. I think we have a few bad apples in the group trying to incite violence to make their point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Attorney General William Barr on Saturday blamed the sometimes-violent protests across the country on \u201canarchic and far-left extremist groups\u201d who travel at some distance \u201cto promote the violence.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But there was no evidence that the crowds in D.C. appeared to be from outside the region. Virtually all of the protesters who spoke with DCist and WAMU reporters identified themselves as locals.<\/p>\n<p>And while demonstrators had gathered as part of a national <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/05\/29\/866022166\/protests-spread-nationwide-on-fourth-night-after-minneapolis-death-of-george-flo\">wave of protests<\/a> over the police-involved deaths of black people around the country\u2014 George Floyd, in Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, Tony McDade in Florida and others \u2014 D.C. protesters also shared concerns about their region.<\/p>\n<p>Josiah, an 18-year-old from District Heights, said he remembers the first time he got pulled over by police while riding in a car with friends. He says he was 14 years old at the time and on his way to a dance at Sidwell Friends School. He recounted how officers \u201cpulled [them] out the car,\u201d though they were doing nothing wrong or illegal.<\/p>\n<p>He said he came out to protest because \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be the one that sits by and does nothing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A few blocks over from the White House, at Vermont Avenue and K Street NW, a group of demonstrators had heated conversations with members of the Metropolitan Police Department, both drawing heavily from personal experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been profiled many times in my life,\u201d said one young black demonstrator.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cD.C. is not as bad as you think it is,\u201d one officer responded. Another officer told the crowd that he was upset by police officers elsewhere who were ruining the reputation of the profession.<\/p>\n<h4>Time To \u2018Step Up\u2019<\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zuriberry\/status\/1266829503852089345\">caravan protest of a few hundred cars, organized by Black Lives Matter D.C.,<\/a> started in the afternoon from the Minnesota Ave. Safeway parking lot in Northeast. The group was seen making its way toward downtown D.C. around 5:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAny opportunity I get to actually be in the streets is really important,\u201d said Ronald Young Jr., 36, of Alexandria, who participated in the caravan.<\/p>\n<p>Remarking on the racial diversity of the crowd, Young said he thinks \u201cit\u2019s time for white folks to step up and be a part of the fight, as long as they know this is an extended fight.\u201d The crowds of protesters in D.C. were largely diverse, with the majority appearing to be in their 20s and 30s.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like, you show up to the protest and you\u2019ve done what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2026 You have to speak to the hearts and minds of people that are around you in your bubble. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to see change,\u201d Young continued.<\/p>\n<p>Alie Karambash, 22, of Montgomery County, said he joined the Black Lives Matter caravan to show solidarity with people of color who are protesting injustices across the country.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think, for me personally, that we\u2019re on the verge of something really transformational as a country,\u201d Karambash said. \u201cHopefully we can make our voices heard to kind of tip the balance on whether that transformation is really good or really bad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brenda Wilson, a resident of Southeast, said she wanted to come out regardless of fears of COVID-19 and the stay-at-home lite orders imposed by Mayor Muriel Bowser, saying: \u201cThis is important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the region, protesters <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PWCPolice\/status\/1266906221187129344\">blocked off traffic<\/a> in Prince William County, where police <a href=\"https:\/\/manager.everbridge.net\/pub\/481590387978458\">declared an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d<\/a> at Bull Run Plaza. Authorities there are asking residents to shelter in place indoors.<\/p>\n<p>In D.C., as the sun went down and the night wore on, the protest became less organized, and the crowd at Lafayette Park thinned out slightly.<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/EZT7pXyWoAEkBHw.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/EZT7pXyWoAEkBHw-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/EZT7pXyWoAEkBHw-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/EZT7pXyWoAEkBHw-900x675.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/EZT7pXyWoAEkBHw-600x450.jpg 600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\"><span class=\"credits\">Gabe Bullard \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/AP_20152142031696-3000x2000-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Police in riot gear watch as demonstrators gather to protest the death of George Floyd, Saturday, May 30, 2020, near the White House in Washington.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes, I wrote and led the effort to continue and fund the current pilot program through the end of FY25 until we can consider a more permanent or expanded program in FY26. The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We made a significant investment in both the operating and capital budgets for ACPS in the FY25 budget allocating over $8 million in new revenue to ACPS out of $11.75 million in new revenue. In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes. These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the long run, property taxes are a terrible way to fund education. If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes. Along with public safety, our schools are our biggest budget priority and they will be a major focus for me on the City Council<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Lewis\"><\/a>James Lewis<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049092\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049092\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-900x675.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1600x1200.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>James Lewis.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy James Lewis campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>James Lewis is a lobbyist for a professional organization for pharmacists working with elderly patients.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding. We need to leverage the unique opportunities available to AHRA and our industrial development authority because we cannot keep waiting for Richmond to fund these needed projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I believe Zoning for Housing was a step in the right direction but much more must be done. Nothing in Z4H ensures that developers build the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d workforce housing or affordable housing. It\u2019s imperative that members of Council use their votes on each and every project to ensure that each project benefits Alexandria and meets the needs of our community members.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

When I look at the City budget, I am constantly reminded the local government is responsible for three major areas: public safety, infrastructure and education. We must do these things well because no other level of government can address them or provide the needed investments. Our schools must be fully funded.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#McPike\"><\/a>Kirk McPike<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049097\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049097\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Kirk McPike.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Kirk McPike campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kirk McPike is a current member of the City Council.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of the roughly $11 million the city would gain from a 2.5 cent increase in property taxes, the council will send $8.7 million to ACPS \u2014 $4.7 million for capital contributions and $4 million for the operating budget. This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
