The U.S. Capitol Police estimated there were between 400 and 450 non-law enforcement people inside the protest area.<\/p>\n<p>Capitol Police said they <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CapitolPolice\/status\/1439301604893728771\">arrested four people;<\/a> one person who was carrying a knife, another who was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/capitolpolice\/status\/1439300407826726916?s=21\">carrying a handgun<\/a> and two people in a car with outstanding arrest warrants from Texas. The department also reported that it had separated groups of protesters and counter-protesters \u201cwithout incident.\u201d The day has otherwise remained peaceful \u2014 a stark contrast to the events on Jan. 6 itself, when swarms of people overwhelmed security forces and breached the seat of the U.S. government.<\/p>\n<p>Speeches lasted about an hour and a half, after which some of the crowd, and law enforcement officials, lingered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is kind of sad, the small amount of people,\u201d said Casey Crawford, a 29 year-old who came from Alaska to attend the rally. \u201cI\u2019m glad that there was a turnout but I think that a lot of people were scared away, saying it was gonna be a false flag.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere around the city, life has carried on as normal with a series of large events: the annual H Street Festival is underway just a few blocks away, the Nationals play a home game this afternoon, a section of downtown D.C. was been turned into a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/09\/16\/downtown-dc-roller-skate-movies-skating\/\">temporary roller-skating rink<\/a>, and Harry Styles is performing tonight at Capital One Arena.<\/p>\n<p>Matt Braynard, the event\u2019s organizer and a former Trump campaign staffer, asked participants to be kind and respectful toward law enforcement officers and the media in his opening speech.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe condemn all violence, political violence,\u201d Braynard told those gathered. \u201cThis is about justice and disparate treatment and equal treatment under the law.\u201d He argues that some of the defendants are being mistreated in solitary confinement and ought to have their charges dropped. Former president Donald Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/trump-expresses-solidarity-with-rioters-arrested-for-jan-6-attack-ahead-of-planned-rally\/2021\/09\/16\/8e14579c-1719-11ec-a5e5-ceecb895922f_story.html\">lent his words<\/a> of support to those \u201cpersecuted so unfairly\u201d earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p>A number of federal judges, meanwhile, have posited that defendants are actually being treated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/legal-issues\/capitol-riot-defendants-lenience\/2021\/08\/25\/6331785e-01be-11ec-ba7e-2cf966e88e93_story.html\">too leniently<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 not paying hefty enough fines and serving minimal jail time.

She didn\u2019t; I mean maybe she\u2019s busy,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cBut it is sad to think that there\u2019s people that say they care about it that didn\u2019t show up for it. We haven\u2019t had a big rally for Jan. 6 because of what happened Jan. 6, so this was kind of a chance to show, in numbers, the people that care about the cause.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Isabella Rizzo and Hannah Pilgrim, George Washington University freshmen students, told DCist\/WAMU they came to the Capitol on Saturday to show that there are people who are opposed to the rally.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJanuary 6 was really scary and I definitely want to show that there\u2019s a counter force against some of these people,\u201d Pilgrim said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad it\u2019s not scary here right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rizzo, wearing a t-shirt with the word \u2018vote\u2019 on it, added that many of those participating in the rally were being led astray by politicians.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the importance of voting for candidates who believe in truth, in science, and in facts,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cIn my opinion, a lot of the leaders right now who represent these people don\u2019t have their interests in mind, or anyone\u2019s interest in mind, but power.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A counterprotest in Freedom Plaza was held about a mile from the Capitol, intentionally far apart in the hopes of preventing the two groups from coming together, according to Chris Geldart, D.C.\u2019s deputy mayor for public safety and justice.<\/p>\n<p>Local mutual aid groups and other activist groups gathered about 75-100 people with snacks and beverages to express opposition to the Justice for J6 gathering and far-right groups. Speakers highlighted local groups that work to provide direct support to unhoused residents.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wamu-slideshow\">\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally1-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Eric Lamar, a counterprotester who came out to show support for police, stands in front of a line of officers on duty. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\"><span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/j6rally3-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">A small crowd of protesters gathered near the U.S. Capitol in support of those arrested in connection with the January 6 insurrection. <span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In the run-up to the rally, experts who monitor extremism online told DCist\/WAMU that they did not expect a crowd anywhere near the likes of the Jan. 6 insurrection.

The couple stopped and crouched around an iPhone, streaming the scene from Minneapolis. Williams anxiously clutched his masked face.<\/p>\n<p>Around him, a few dozen people (and an even larger number of reporters) were gathered on the stretch of 16th Street NW. Shortly after 5 p.m., they learned the verdict: former police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts he faced in the murder of George Floyd.<\/p>\n<p>Williams burst into tears. He and Toledo clutched each other in a long embrace as they absorbed the news.<\/p>\n<p>Across the city, D.C. residents cheered and honked car horns.<\/p>\n<p>City officials had braced for the possibility of large-scale protests after the verdict, with <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/04\/20\/dc-national-guard-activated-chauvin-verdict-protests\/\">250 National Guard troops<\/a> deployed at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. Instead, a happy, but subdued crowd of people milled around BLM Plaza, reflecting on the moment in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/08\/27\/what-does-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-plaza-mean-to-locals\/\">symbolic space<\/a> that came into existence in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing.<\/p>\n<p>The area quickly became a nexus of ongoing protests against racial injustice (as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/08\/27\/what-does-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-plaza-mean-to-locals\/\">backdrop<\/a> for other <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/06\/joe-biden-presidential-election-dc-blm-plaza-march-protest\/\">historic moments<\/a>).

He urged people to keep showing up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt got quieter, but the murders, the hate crimes didn\u2019t cease,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who think that it\u2019s over, they\u2019re wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, the moment has offered a modicum of relief.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like justice was served,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI felt like we finally can walk the streets and feel safe and protected \u2014 somewhat protected \u2014 from police.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Floyd\u2019s family remained in his thoughts: \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of time that they can get back with George.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/04\/20\/dc-black-lives-matter-plaza-reaction-chauvin-guilty-verdict\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DCist<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning reporting and programs upon which you\u2019ve come to expect and rely, including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, 1A, The Politics Hour with Kojo Nnamdi, shows from the WAMU Podcast Team, and many more!<\/p>\n\t\t<p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a href=\"\/donate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button-donate\"><svg class=\"wamu-icon\"><use xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#wamu-heart\"><\/use><\/svg>Donate<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>A few dozen people gathered at the symbolic space on 16th Street to learn that former police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts in the murder of George Floyd. <\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/21\/04\/20\/dc-black-lives-matter-plaza-reaction-chauvin-guilty-verdict\/","currentSlug":"dc-black-lives-matter-plaza-reaction-chauvin-guilty-verdict","created":"2021-04-20T20:18:44","modified":"2021-04-21T11:39:18","time":"Apr 20, 2021","timestamp":1618949924,"timestampGMT":1618964324,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>London Williams and Stephanie Toledo watch the verdict reading on a phone.

Under Curfew, Public Emergency","content":"<p>The U.S. Capitol was thrown into violent disarray Wednesday afternoon as insurrectionists in support of President Donald Trump breached the building and sowed chaos inside.<\/p>\n<p>Four people died on the Capitol grounds, including a woman fatally shot by U.S. Capitol Police and three others who died of apparent medical emergencies, according to Robert Contee, the acting chief of the Metropolitan Police Department.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. residents had been warned by elected officials to stay away from the rallies scheduled during the week to protest Congress certifying Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. The Proud Boys, an extremist group of self-described \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d with ties to white supremacy, threatened <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2021\/01\/05\/parler-telegram-violence-dc-protests\/\">violence and destruction in the city ahead of <\/a>the events. Two previous MAGA rallies held in D.C. in the wake of the 2020 election saw stabbings and other altercations.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous local officials have raised concerns about a response by Capitol Police they deemed underprepared and inadequate.<\/p>\n<p>Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen, who chairs the committee that oversees D.C.\u2019s police department, called the Capitol Police response a \u201ccomplete failure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMPD has gone in to help support. But what we\u2019re watching is nothing short of domestic terrorists, an attempt at a coup, and sedition,\u201d said Allen. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how there wasn\u2019t a better preparation for what we\u2019re seeing take place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After lawmakers went into lockdown or were evacuated, D.C. police took the lead in clearing the Capitol building of insurrectionists, with the help of a series of local law enforcement agencies on the scene to assist. In response to the scenes of violent chaos, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayorbowser\/status\/1346902298044325893?s=21\">ordered<\/a> a 6 p.m. curfew. (Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GovernorVA\/status\/1346947694921723904\">declared a 6 p.m. curfew<\/a> in Arlington County and the City of Alexandria and issued a state of emergency in Virginia.)<\/p>\n<p>By late Wednesday evening, D.C. police had arrested 52 people \u2014 47 of those arrests were related to curfew violations and unlawful entry, and half of the total arrests occurred on U.S. Capitol grounds, according to Contee. He said that police began enforcing the curfew order at the Capitol and then fanned out to other parts of the city, and would continue to enforce it until it ended at 6 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>Officials are releasing images of people who breached the Capitol to make sure they are \u201cheld accountable for the carnage,\u201d Bowser said.<\/p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers have also recovered weapons including two pipe bombs in downtown D.C. near the Republican National Committee headquarters and Democratic National Committee headquarters, as well as a cooler with Molotov cocktails discovered in a vehicle on the Capitol grounds.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"slideshow-caption\">Trump supporters try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington.

The session was halted in the middle of debate over the results in Arizona, and Capitol Police proceeded to try to lock down the building.<\/p>\n<p>Police were unable to secure the building: After successfully breaking through a barricade, one group clashed with Capitol Police on the Capitol steps. Police deployed chemical irritants in an attempt to control the crowd. Inside the building, pro-Trump extremists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates\/2021\/01\/06\/954028436\/u-s-capitol-locked-down-amid-escalating-far-right-protests\">were seen<\/a> wandering in the House and Senate floors, smashing windows, and occupying offices.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of the building, protesters chanted to push forward, while individuals climbed walls around the Capitol campus. Others paraded large American flags through the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>A haze of smoke obscured the building as Capitol Police used what appeared to be chemical irritants and flash bangs to clear extremists from the steps and nearby scaffolding. The crowd yelled back at police, shouting, \u201cTraitors! Traitors!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Officers with D.C. police arrived at the scene in riot gear shortly thereafter, and law enforcement succeeded in clearing protesters entirely off the Capitol lawn shortly before 6 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The D.C. National Guard was deployed after an initial delay. The governors of Virginia and Maryland both sent in National Guard troops and state troops. Police officers from Fairfax County and Prince George\u2019s County were also in the District to assist with the response, according to DCist\/WAMU reporters on the scene. Police officers from Baltimore County were also deployed on Wednesday afternoon to help, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BaltCoExec\/status\/1346933849024917507\">County Executive Johnny Olszewski<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back, you fucking traitors,\u201d one insurrectionist yelled toward authorities as they cleared the area around the Capitol.<\/p>\n<p>At 7:30 p.m., nearly an hour and a half into the District-wide curfew, a crowd dozens strong remained on Pennsylvania Ave. Hundreds of law enforcement officers, some of whom appeared to be members of the National Guard and FBI, began encircling the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>As law enforcement officers let people exit the kettle, one man shouted: \u201cFucking pig cocksuckers, we\u2019re coming back with rifles next time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Multiple local officials have criticized the Capitol Police for what they saw as an initially tepid response to the riots.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a complete disgrace,\u201d Ward 4 Councilmember Janeese Lewis George wrote on Twitter. \u201cOver the summer we saw federal law enforcement use tear gas, flash bangs, and rubber bullets on Black Lives Matter protesters without provocation. Where are the riot squads now? Are they standing down as white supremacists attempt a coup?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ward 8 Councilmember Trayon White also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/trayonwhite\/status\/1346825160339431425\/photo\/1\">wrote a letter to Bowser<\/a> questioning whether D.C. police were being as diligent about surveilling for potential illegal guns among right-wing protesters as they are about surveilling D.C. residents.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine also criticized federal law enforcement\u2019s lack of preparedness for the day\u2019s violence.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe social media made it clear as far as to what was going to occur,\u201d Racine said in an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewsHour\/status\/1346955097025241089\">interview with PBS NewsHour<\/a>, in an apparent reference to the violent threats <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2021\/01\/05\/parler-telegram-violence-dc-protests\/\">documented on pro-Trump and far-right forums<\/a> in rtecent days. Racine said the police reaction was a stark contrast to the response to protests against police killings of Black people over the summer, when federal law enforcement from multiple agencies mobilized to protect the U.S. Capitol \u201cfor no reason when there was a peaceful protest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At-large Councilmember Christina Henderson, who worked on the Hill for four years before her current role, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chenderson\/status\/1346905065416753152\">wrote on Twitter<\/a> that she had seen the U.S. Capitol Police \u201cuse more force with protesters in wheelchairs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bowser said she observed some differences between federal agencies\u2019 treatment of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square, who were tear gassed, and the insurrectionists at the Capitol. \u201cWe saw a different type of vehicles used,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw a different posture used in some cases. We did not see, for example, deployment of those military personnel on the Capitol grounds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Late in the evening, the mayor extended the public emergency she declared in the District for an additional 15 days, a timespan that includes the presidential inauguration. That allows her to more easily corral resources for public safety.<\/p>\n<p>She, like many local officials, has insisted that Trump be held accountable for the day\u2019s events.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomsherwood\/status\/1346982463378255872\">Racine<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlesallen\/status\/1346985775448154112\">Allen<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchi.mp\/dccouncil\/councilmember-kenyan-mcduffie-condemns-insurrection-by-trump-supporters-at-us-capitol?e=416b608650\">Ward 5 Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie<\/a> have joined a <a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/administration\/532988-democratic-lawmakers-call-for-pence-to-invoke-25th-amendment-remove\">chorus of Democratic members of Congress<\/a> in calling for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office.

Police Chief Peter Newsham Is Stepping Down To Head Prince William County\u2019s Police Department","content":"<p>D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham is stepping down to head the Prince William County Police Department in Northern Virginia after more than three decades on the force.<\/p>\n<p>Newsham will start the new position on February 1, 2021, according to Sherrie Johnson, a spokesperson for the county. He will be replacing former Chief Barry Barnard, who retired this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Ann Wheeler, chair of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and a Democrat, said Newsham stood out among candidates for his long tenure at MPD.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis level of experience and his breadth of leadership qualities I think are exemplary,\u201d she told DCist\/WAMU.<\/p>\n<p>Wheeler said Newsham will move to Prince William, which is located about 30 miles southwest of D.C. and has a population just shy of half a million.<\/p>\n<p>While it is the second-most populous county in the commonwealth and growing, many areas remain rural \u2014 a far cry from the urban police department where Newsham has spent his entire policing career.<\/p>\n<p>Newsham was <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/02\/23\/newsham-is-police-chief\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nominated for the top job at the Metropolitan Police Department in 2017<\/a> and was easily confirmed by the D.C. Council (At-large Councilmember David Grosso was the lone holdout). But he has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/public-safety\/tensions-rise-between-dc-police-group-that-gathers-in-northeast-neighborhood\/2018\/06\/28\/399ad184-796d-11e8-93cc-6d3beccdd7a3_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">faced escalating scrutiny<\/a> in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Amid a surge of protests in the city following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/25\/d-c-lawmakers-take-steps-to-limit-police-budget-review-police-chief-next-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawmakers voted <\/a>this summer to require the current police chief to undergo a review every four years to stay on the job. That means Newsham would have been up for review next year.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about Newsham\u2019s handling of recent incidents in which officers were involved in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/06\/13\/mpd-shoots-and-kills-man-in-ward-8\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deaths <\/a>of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/05\/10\/dquan-young-was-shot-by-an-off-duty-police-officer-a-year-later-his-family-is-mourning-and-seeking-answers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/03\/04\/family-of-man-killed-in-crash-with-d-c-police-sues-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black men<\/a>, Wheeler said, \u201cI trust that he handled those in D.C. as appropriate and will do the same in Prince William County.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The county said that Newsham emerged as the top candidate after a national recruitment process that fielded 50 applicants from 16 states and D.C.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement, which came late on a Tuesday evening, caught many by surprise, including within the Metropolitan Police Department. A spokesman in MPD\u2019s press office told DCist\/WAMU the department couldn\u2019t immediately confirm the news.<\/p>\n<p>More than an hour after the announcement was made, Bowser issued a brief emailed statement thanking Newsham for his service.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring his time as Chief, he led the department through a time of great change and challenge for our city and our nation,\u201d the mayor said, adding that an interim chief will be announced soon.<\/p>\n<p>Council Chairman Phil Mendelson followed with his own statement. \u201cI am as surprised as everyone else at the news of Police Chief Newsham\u2019s decision to leave MPD,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry to see him leave after roughly three decades \u2013 a lot of service to the citizens of the District.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>Grosso, who has been among Newsham\u2019s fiercest critics, told DCist\/WAMU he hadn\u2019t been made aware of the news in advance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no indication for me that he was going to leave D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can imagine he doesn\u2019t feel too welcome here right now. He\u2019s constantly being berated here by people calling for his resignation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Newsham joined D.C.\u2019s police force in 1989 and became an assistant police chief in 2002. He had been serving as the head of the Investigative Services Bureau when he was <a href=\"http:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/16\/08\/23\/mayor-bowser-names-peter-newsham-in\/\">tapped to serve as interim chief<\/a> in the wake of Cathy Lanier\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/16\/09\/16\/lanier-is-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">departure in 2016<\/a>. Six months later, Bowser <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/02\/23\/newsham-is-police-chief\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">named him to the role permanently<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the years since, D.C. <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/03\/dc-homicides-reach-a-grim-milestone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has largely seen an uptick in homicides<\/a>, while a number of other violent crimes have stayed flat or declined.<\/p>\n<p>And while the nation\u2019s capital has always been accustomed to demonstrations, Newsham\u2019s tenure also saw sustained protests in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. The mayor and many other supporters have praised the city\u2019s police force as the best trained in the country in terms of handling First Amendment activities. Most big demonstrations in the city end with few, or no, police clashes.<\/p>\n<p>But MPD\u2019s response to large-scale protests has also been a recurring criticism throughout Newsham\u2019s time on the force.<\/p>\n<p>As an assistant police chief in 2002, he oversaw the arrests of hundreds of anti-globalization demonstrators at Pershing Park. The ensuing lawsuits cost the city millions of dollars in settlements, and led the department to reconsider its policies. (His handling of that incident, along with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox5dc.com\/news\/local-news\/221018540-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allegations of domestic violence<\/a> in the early 2000s, were among the catalysts of a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/05\/02\/its-official-council-approves-newsham\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">failed \u201cNever Newsham\u201d campaign<\/a> against his nomination for police chief.)<\/p>\n<p>Fifteen years later, when Newsham was serving as the interim chief of the department, MPD officers <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/01\/20\/police-arrest-90\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kettled and arrested hundreds of protesters<\/a> during Trump\u2019s inauguration. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of D.C. charged 230 people with felony rioting after those arrests, but <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/07\/06\/prosecutors-dismiss-rioting-charges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was unable to secure any guilty verdicts<\/a>.An investigation by the<a href=\"http:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/02\/28\/office-of-police-complaints-wants-i\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Office of Police Complaints<\/a> found that officers indiscriminately used nonlethal weapons like pepper spray against protesters who didn\u2019t pose an immediate threat, and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/09\/27\/lawsuit-over-unconstitutional-arrests-on-inauguration-day-can-go-forward-judge-rules\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protesters filed a lawsuit <\/a>accusing police of violating their constitutional rights.<\/p>\n<p>This summer, criticism of police protest tactics has ratcheted up amid a historic several months of demonstrations against police brutality. Officers have <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/31\/dc-protesters-mpd-police-clash-again-sunday-near-black-lives-matter-plaza\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used nonlethal weapons<\/a> against protesters, including chemical irritants and rubber bullets. In June, MPD kettled dozens of people on a residential street, appearing to launch pepper spray and flash bangs at the group and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/02\/dupont-dc-home-protest-rahul-dubey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sending them running for shelter into nearby homes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The ACLU <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/08\/mpd-lafayette-square-tear-gas-june-1-trump-lawsuit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has also sued MPD <\/a>for alleged involvement in an incident where protesters were cleared from Lafayette Square, presumably to allow President Trump to appear in photos in front of St. John\u2019s Church; MPD has denied involvement.<\/p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/dc-police-protesters-clash-again-near-black-lives-matter-plaza\/2020\/08\/31\/e918c9c6-eb31-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0a night in August<\/a> that <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/31\/dc-protesters-mpd-police-clash-again-sunday-near-black-lives-matter-plaza\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saw particularly intense clashes<\/a>, Newsham defended his officers and claimed that much of the violence was caused by people looking to sow chaos. \u201cWhen you throw bricks and rocks and bottles and urine, and you set fires, there is going to be a police reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo folks who want to suggest or paint the picture that this was somehow peaceful, and the police indiscriminately used munitions against them, they\u2019re not being honest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Two people were also killed this year in encounters with D.C. police officers, stoking further criticism of Newsham and his leadership of the force. In September, an officer <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/03\/d-c-police-release-body-camera-footage-showing-fatal-shooting-of-18-year-old-deon-kay-in-southeast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shot and killed 18-year-old Deon Kay <\/a>in Congress Heights, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/18\/deon-kay-dc-police-educators-mentors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sparking protests <\/a>for several nights.

Hylton-Brown had been riding a Revel moped, looking for his lost keys, friends said. MPD officers <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/10\/28\/dc-family-friends-of-karon-hylton-demand-police-accountability-in-protest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are not allowed to chase vehicles over traffic violations<\/a>, and the department is currently looking into whether the pursuing officers violated policy.<\/p>\n<p>While he has some vocal detractors, Newsham has retained steadfast support from Bowser, who remains broadly popular in D.C.<\/p>\n<p>The D.C. Police Union wished Newsham well following the announcement, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DCPoliceUnion\/status\/1331427418847006726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing on Twitter<\/a> that \u201chis contributions to the MPD will not be soon forgotten.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other policing experts <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/17\/d-c-council-and-police-chief-square-off-amid-police-reform-debate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have told DCist\/WAMU<\/a> that MPD instituted sweeping reforms to improve training and discipline during Newsham\u2019s time on the force. He also oversaw the full deployment of body-worn cameras for more than 3,200 officers, and <a href=\"https:\/\/mayor.dc.gov\/release\/mayor-bowser-highlights-partnership-between-mpd-and-udc-cc-national-museum-african-american\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched an anti-bias training program<\/a> for officers in conjunction with the National Museum of African American History and Culture.<\/p>\n<p>Over in Prince William County, Newsham will oversee about 700 officers, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/potomaclocal.com\/2020\/11\/24\/d-c-chief-tapped-to-lead-prince-william-police\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Potomac Local<\/a>, which notes that a new Racial and Social Justice Commission will spend the next year examining the police department\u2019s hiring and use-of-force policies.<\/p>\n<p>Wheeler said she looked forward to Newsham bringing his experience working in a fast-paced environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrince William County is a diversely rich community and it\u2019s cutting edge in many ways and so we\u2019re excited to have a police chief bring that level of expertise.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There has also been upheaval at a number of other regional police departments, with the top cops in <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/18\/prince-georges-pd-chief-hank-stawinski-resigns-racism-report-md\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prince George\u2019s<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/05\/fairfax-county-police-chief-edwin-c-roessler-jr-announces-his-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fairfax<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/30\/anne-arundel-interim-police-chief-william-lowry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anne Arundel<\/a> counties all stepping down in recent months.<\/p>\n<p>With Newsham\u2019s departure, Bowser will be charged with finding a new police chief. But what has in the past been a predictable and relatively non-controversial process of elevating someone from the department\u2019s ranks \u2014 Newsham followed after Lanier, herself an MPD veteran \u2014 is likely to be challenged by a council that has become more assertive on policing.<\/p>\n<p>While lawmakers <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/10\/protesters-called-on-the-d-c-council-to-defund-the-police-did-that-actually-happen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">did not take a significant step towards defunding MPD<\/a> during this year\u2019s budget cycle, they <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/09\/d-c-council-passes-emergency-police-reform-bill-but-delays-shrinking-size-of-mpd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">did pass legislation<\/a> that enhances accountability in the department, tightens discipline and training, and prohibits officers from using chokeholds during arrests or chemical irritants during peaceful protests. It also created a Police Reform Commission, which is expected to recommend changes to MPD by early next year.<\/p>\n<p>The council will also welcome two new members in January \u2014 Christina Henderson in an At-Large seat and Janeese Lewis George in the Ward 4 seat. George, a self-described democratic socialist who has echoed the calls for police funding to be redirected to social services, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/19\/meet-the-women-who-will-turn-the-d-c-council-majority-female-for-the-first-time-in-decades\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently told DCist\/WAMU<\/a> that public safety issues would be a \u201cDay One\u201d priority for her when she takes office.<\/p>\n<p>Grosso, who often stood alone in his criticism of Newsham, said that the new dynamics on the council could well shape who Bowser picks \u2014 and how lawmakers respond.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIs the mayor willing to put someone up who will embrace more of what the council has pushed for in terms of harm reduction? If the mayor doesn\u2019t\u2026 is the council willing to stand up to her?\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more members now that are willing to stand up to her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In his statement, Mendelson seemed to agree with at least part of Grosso\u2019s sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis presents an opportunity to try new approaches to law enforcement and new strategies to fight violent crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a good cop, but sometimes a fresh face can be a good, too.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Newsham will start in February 2021.

The White House In Celebration","content":"<p>Thousands of people poured into downtown D.C. after news broke that Joseph Biden had won the presidency, marking a jubilant end to five consecutive days of anxious demonstrations near the White House.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am relieved that there is a sense of normalcy, humility and just humanitarian compassion back in the White House,\u201d said Malcolm Sherod, a 26-year-old lobbyist, after taking a celebratory swill of champagne straight from the bottle in Black Lives Matter Plaza. \u201cI feel like every day I\u2018ve been holding my breath in the worst nightmare of my life. I am so happy that day is over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The ever-growing crowd danced to the iconic riffs of Kool &amp; The Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebration,\u201d making good on the lyrics: \u201cThere\u2019s a party goin\u2019 on right here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Across the rest of the city, drivers honked their horns, residents clanged all manner of pots and pans, and people cheered out of their windows on a bright, unseasonably warm November afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>On a sidewalk in Columbia Heights, a group of 20-somethings drank champagne out of paper cups, while a couple danced salsa in the walkway to their home. Going up 15th Street in Northwest, women sang \u201cF*ck Donald Trump\u201d repeatedly out their car windows as they rode in their vehicles. Down by Farragut Square, a convertible headed across K street with a cardboard cutout of Joe Biden standing up in the backseat. A number of Metrobus drivers changed one of their digital signs on the front of the bus to read \u201cJoe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Biden surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed with an AP call for his win in Pennsylvania at 11:25 a.m. That puts the electoral vote total, per the AP, at 284 for President-elect Biden and 214 for President Trump. (Alaska, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina remain to be called by the wire service.)<\/p>\n<p>Minutes later, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton spoke to the crowd gathered near McPherson Square.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe American people are ready to see Donald Trump going, going, gone,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>A small, but excited crowd also gathered on the grounds of Howard University, where student groups danced around the quad and alumni of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in support of member and now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a historic day. A day of joy and relief for us all, and I couldn\u2019t think of any better place to come,\u201d said Tralonne Shorter, who came over from Arlington with her young son to celebrate at her alma mater. \u201cAt a time in our country when there have been so many challenges and barriers to equal justice and for people of color and our reckoning, for someone to be in the White House at this time, coming from historically black colleges, really sort of underscores the value of Black Lives Matter. And so Howard is significant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Howard student Ashley Gray came to the campus on Saturday \u2014 three days after completing her dissertation on Black women in leadership \u2014 to celebrate Harris\u2019 achievement. A history-making win three times over, Harris will be the first female, the first South Asian-American, and the first Black vice president.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s symbolic history in us being here, and her having gotten her foundation here, so this is a great place to be today,\u201d Gray said.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the nucleus of the city\u2019s jubilation is in the jam-packed blocks around the White House, where cars are stuck in the most exuberant kind of gridlock and thousands of people are dancing in the streets. A mainstay of protests this summer, the Long Live Go-Go truck blasted the \u201cY.M.C.A,\u201d reclaiming it after a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-features\/ymca-village-people-song-trump-1087151\/\">year of the song playing at Donald Trump rallies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. resident Rob Sassor was at home when he heard honking and the clatter of pots and pans, and knew he wanted to head to BLM Plaza.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe knew that this was coming, it was just a matter of time,\u201d Sassor said. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to finally have it culminate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the celebration of Biden\u2019s win in BLM Plaza was marked with dancing, singing, and an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NatashaBertrand\/status\/1325135662543220736\">inflatable Trump-as-rat float<\/a>, some noted that the work doesn\u2019t end when Trump leaves office. Among those gathered downtown, several highlighted issues they\u2019d want Biden to prioritize as president. D.C. resident Hope Puiton said that Democrats now need to work to hold Biden accountable on his campaign promises, like addressing racial injustice and climate change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tall order,\u201d Puiton said of Biden\u2019s now-expected deliverables. \u201cDems need to keep pushing, keep organizing. This is clearly just the beginning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Others seemed less enthusiastic about the Biden victory, but relieved nonetheless about the soon-to-be end of Trump\u2019s stay in the White House. Beyond BLM Plaza, cars drove down Columbia Pike in Arlington, honking their horns as people milled about a popular taco truck.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Biden is the answer nor is Harris,\u201d said resident Nicole Green who gathered with the group. \u201cBut I\u2019m just happy that we don\u2019t have a complete narcissist in the White House anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Biden issued a statement on Saturday after the race was called, saying he was \u201chonored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,\u201d Biden said in the brief statement.<\/p>\n<p>In a city where Trump got a mere 5% of the vote, residents and elected officials alike responded with glee.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, DC has a special interest in who becomes our most famous neighbor, and we could not be prouder to have President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris join our city,\u201d Bowser said in a statement. \u201cThey will not only bring dignity back to the White House, but a real commitment to the shared values we uphold and fight for every day in our city \u2014 the values embodied by Black Lives Matter Plaza leading right up to their front door.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The mayor followed up with a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MurielBowser\/status\/1325139958324060162\">tweet<\/a>: \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting to exhale for four years.\u201d Other local leaders also shared their excitement on social media. Ward 5 D.C. Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CM_McDuffie\/status\/1325147699033812992\"> tweeted his congratulations<\/a>, as did <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlesallen\/status\/1325115431707938819\">Ward 6\u2019s Charles Allen<\/a> (he also made a pitch to<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlesallen\/status\/1325153209795678209\"> mobilize support <\/a>in a Georgia Senate race run-off with D.C. statehood in mind). Two of the council\u2019s newest members, Christina Henderson and Janeese Lewis George, are Harris\u2019 Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters.<\/p>\n<p>The Trump campaign is still contesting the process in several states, including Pennsylvania. The president and his team have made a number of false accusations, baselessly claiming that the election is being stolen from him as legitimate ballots continue to be counted. In Pennsylvania and other places, mail-in ballots that are taking longer to count have broken heavily toward Biden and eaten into significant leads by the president in votes cast on Election Day. States will certify results in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>About 200 Trump supporters are gathered around the base of the Washington Monument, at one point chanting \u201cNo more years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But at a stoplight on 16th Street on Saturday afternoon, a woman stood up through the sunroof, beaming and waving a Biden-Harris banner. It was pointed straight at the White House.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>On a bright, unseasonably warm November afternoon, Washington came out in droves as Joe Biden was declared the

Thousands Demand Racial Equality At March On Washington","content":"<p><strong>This story was last updated at 12:39 a.m. on Aug. 29<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 1963, Murray Flemming was a 14-year-old in Chicago, wishing he could attend the March on Washington. Jenene Miller was just a one-month old baby. Breyanna Collier was still three decades from being born.<\/p>\n<p>They were among the multi-generational crowd on the National Mall on a hot summer\u2019s day, energized by the movement and deeply dismayed by the historic parallels that remain more than a half century later.<\/p>\n<p>The National Action Network began planning the march in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing in June, which sparked uprisings around the country. The new March on Washington was scheduled for 57 years to the day that Martin Luther King Jr. made his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.<\/p>\n<p>Flemming\u2019s family of seven couldn\u2019t afford the trip to the original event. This time he was able to come with his wife, daughter, and granddaughter.<\/p>\n<p>The 71-year-old has told them stories of what it was like to grow up as a black man in a largely segregated Chicago. Flemming recalls being chased away from a hamburger and hotdog stand in a white part of town, as people threw bottles and bricks at him and his friends in 1966.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTell you the truth, I never thought I would see this day where black, white, across the board Americans come together for a cause that\u2019s righteous \u2014 and that\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cTo not just care about the population, but one population within the people that\u2019s been treated unfairly for a very, very long time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller drove 10 hours with her husband and waited on line for an hour and a half to enter the Mall grounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here from Atlanta, home of John Lewis. We went to Selma for his farewell when he came across the Peace Bridge for the last time and we wanted to be here for this,\u201d Miller said, her voice slightly muffled by a black mask with white lettering that read \u201cVOTE\u201d and a face shield that declared \u201cGOOD TROUBLE.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want the virus, but we have to be here for the cause. It\u2019s worth it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She was an infant during the first march, and reflects on how much remains the same.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere I am 57 years later and it doesn\u2019t seem like much changed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m here, as an adult, for this march, for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Collier attended a protest in June back home in Charleston, South Carolina. The 25-year-old joined an activist book club, which spurred her to become a poll worker and to reflect more deeply on both her own experiences and the country\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think for a minute people felt like we were living in a post-racialized society, but it has not gone away,\u201d she said, as she headed for the Mall early this morning. \u201cWhen you\u2019re learning, you do the history, you understand we\u2019re not that far. We haven\u2019t come that far. We\u2019ve made headway, but there\u2019s still a lot more work to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Protesters gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Masked protesters stand in front of the Lincoln Memorial as the Rev.

As Trump spoke on Thursday night, he\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2020\/08\/27\/us\/rnc-convention-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made little mention<\/a>\u00a0of the national grief following recent police killings of Black Americans.<\/p>\n<p>But on Friday, before a crowd that was largely made up of Black and Brown attendees, speakers invoked the names of those killed by police, often growing overcome by emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Kentucky Rep. Charles Booker spoke about Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBreonna, I\u2019m representing you right now,\u201d Booker told the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Families of people killed by police frequently paused during their respective remarks, overcome with emotion. The crowd filled the silences with cries of \u201cSay his name \u2026 George Floyd,\u201d and \u201cSay her name \u2026 Breonna Taylor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed right now, with everybody here right now,\u201d said Philonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd. \u201cI wish George were here to see this right now. That\u2019s who I\u2019m marching for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Martin Luther King III introduced his 12-year-old daughter Yolanda Renee King, who spoke to her generation from the same monument where her grandfather Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 57 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGreat challenges produce great leaders. We have mastered the selfie and Tik Tok, now we must master ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cLess than a year before he was assassinated, my grandfather predicted this very moment. He said we were moving into a new phase of the struggle. The first phase was the civil rights. And the new phase is genuine equality. \u2026 We are going to be the generation that ends systemic racism once and for all, now and forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After telling the crowd that he was a \u201cproud dad,\u201d Martin Luther King III noted that the March on Washington is also assembled on the day that 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi in 1955.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c65 years later, we still struggle for justice,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Rev. Al Sharpton, head of NAN, called for political change, advocating for two pieces of legislation:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/7120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act<\/a>, a sweeping federal police reform bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020, a reinstatement of the Voting Rights Act.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDemonstration without legislation will not lead to change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out here and stand in this heat because we didn\u2019t have anything to do.

Matter Protesters Converged In D.C.","content":"<p><em>This story was last updated on July 5 at 4:12 a.m.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>D.C. marinated in broiler-like temperatures and soupy humidity. Firecrackers sparkled over the National Mall and boomed over residential neighborhoods. And, well, pretty much everything else was different on July 4, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The usual parades and concerts were nowhere to be found, replaced by demonstrations against racism and police brutality. At the front of one march, protesters carried a sign that asked: \u201cWhat does freedom really look like?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking on 15th Street NW near the White House, Aliyah Graves-Brown said this year, in particular, has involved a reckoning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn this July 4, in particular, we\u2019re realizing that the Fourth of July, in fact, has nothing to do with freedom and everything to do with celebrating white supremacy and the independence of a certain group of people,\u201d the 25-year-old D.C. resident said. \u201cThis day is a reminder of, for people who look like us at least, our lack of freedom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while the fireworks went on per usual, far fewer people headed to the National Mall or other popular spots than a typical year, as many appeared to heed the advice of local officials to stay home amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was surprised at how dead the streets were. There\u2019s hardly anyone out and about other than the Fourth of July,\u201d said Jenny Cudd, a 36-year-old who flew in from Midland-Odessa, Texas, to enthusiastically celebrate the holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Bedecked in a Trump shirt, Trump 2020 earrings, and a Make America Great Again hat, Cudd was among the biggest crowd of the president\u2019s supporters that this city has seen in months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad the president decided to overrule the local mayor who wanted to shut down the Independence Day celebration because we the people own the federal parks,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly before the fireworks began, the confluence of Trump backers and demonstrators against police brutality made for a brief but cinematic confrontation at the Washington Monument.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals on both sides got into heated, pointed confrontations \u2014 some of them physical \u2014 with one another as a chorus of competing chants of \u201cU.S.A., U.S.A.\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d broke out.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. Park Police arrived within minutes, and dozens of officers fanned out to separate the groups. As they moved Trump supporters to one side and Black Lives Matter protesters to another, fireworks exploded overhead, and quick flashes of red, white, and blue glinted off riot shields.<\/p>\n<p>It was as fitting an image of July 4, 2020 as they come.<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"

divided Fourth<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<p>In a different world, the one that we inhabited as recently as two years ago, the National Mall would be filled with a crush of people jockeying for a decent patch of grass to lay a picnic blanket on.<\/p>\n<p>But if last year\u2019s Salute for America \u2014 which cost <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/27\/president-trump-salute-to-america-dc-double-july-fourth\/\">roughly double the usual festivities<\/a> \u2014 made for surreal scenes of tanks rolling through town and an inflatable Trump baby balloon floating above protesters on the National Mall, the circumstances of this year\u2019s Independence Day made for something almost as unusual: room to stretch out on the Mall on the Fourth of July.<\/p>\n<p>Large swaths of green space lay unclaimed for most of the day. As the show time for fireworks grew closer, more spectators showed up and people sprawled on the ground or sat in camping chairs in small groups, with plenty of room in between.<\/p>\n<p>A number of federal lawmakers had <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/05\/27\/trump-dc-salute-to-america-covid-19-should-cancel\/\">urged the president to forgo <\/a>the traditional celebrations, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other local officials <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/01\/dc-govt-says-stay-home-july-4\/\">expressed concern<\/a> that large-scale gatherings on the National Mall would violate both local and federal guidelines on crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser implored residents to stay home in a series of press conferences and social media posts. (The mayor also didn\u2019t waste the opportunity to get in a few jabs on Twitter, too, writing things like \u201cJust because someone invites you to a party doesn\u2019t mean you have to go.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>While many people appeared to have listened, thousands of people still came out, both for Trump\u2019s modified \u201cSalute to America,\u201d which took place at the White House rather than the Lincoln Memorial, and to participate in a number of demonstrations against racism and police brutality throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>And despite the pandemic, people traveled from afar to attend both.<\/p>\n<p>John Turano and his daughter Bianca came from Los Angeles to catch the fireworks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis day, at least I can stand for what I believe in,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cAnd we can be out here and enjoy the celebration, even though there\u2019s not a lot of people out here. It\u2019s nice to be out here and able to be who I am and not be judged for it\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ralph Clayton, 58, drove nine hours from Athens, Georgia, to support protesters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been done wrong a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis new generation of kids is coming up \u2026 I stand behind them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beads of sweat sticking to his face, Clayton said he had waited his entire life for racial justice and planned to spend the next two days waving his \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d flags in the D.C. streets.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4856294\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1610px;\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4856294\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-04-at-5.35.14-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Derrick Walker and his son DJ protest on bike on Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street NW on July 4, 2020<span class=\"credits\">Daniella Cheslow \/ WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h4>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to celebrate\u201d<\/h4>\n<p>Among the protesters who came out to Black Lives Matter Plaza and a series of other rallies, many reflected on the holiday\u2019s themes of independence and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur ancestors weren\u2019t necessarily free,\u201d said Lacresha Millner, who brought her four nieces to the plaza.\u00a0Millner, who lives in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, added that her family celebrated\u00a0Juneteenth, the day enslaved Black people in Texas were told they were free, with a family barbecue and firecrackers.\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. is celebrating our independence but yet there were still people who had no independence.<\/p>\n<p>A protester who had spent the night at Black Lives Matter Plaza and only identified himself as \u201cSleez\u201d put it plainly:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was independence for white, land-owning men,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t free. Black people damn sure weren\u2019t free. Native Americans weren\u2019t free. It\u2019s nothing to celebrate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Austin Riddick, a 22-year-old D.C. resident, said his family never participates in July Fourth festivities. \u201cThis year, like every year, freedom is an idea and something to strive for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reality and it never has been.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Derrick Walker participated in one roving protest with his 12-year-old son at 15th and Pennsylvania, he reflected on how his perception of the holiday has changed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Fourth of July used to mean independence and freedom. However, given the circumstances of society at this point, it\u2019s really just another day,\u201d said Walker, a 47-year-old from Stafford, Virginia. \u201cIf it was independence, we wouldn\u2019t really be marching. If it spelled freedom, where people weren\u2019t being killed, no matter what the cause, we wouldn\u2019t be out here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said he fears for his kids, including a 17-year-old son who is getting ready to go to college and his tween boy, who likes to ride his bike around town.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow I\u2019m actually afraid to let him,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to grow with fear. But he already has it. We were riding through one of the neighborhoods here in D.C., and he said to me, \u2018Dad, we could be shot for being here.\u2019 My 12-year-old said that. And that broke my heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"

supporters clash near the Washington Monument as fireworks erupt overhead on July 4, 2020.<span class=\"credits\">Daniella Cheslow \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<h4>Skirmishes around the National Mall<\/h4>\n<p>The day of protest and reckoning got its start with a number of disparate <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/02\/dc-blm-protests-independence-day-weekend\/\">demonstrations<\/a> throughout the city, including a sit-in at the Supreme Court, a march of veterans, and the unveiling of a \u201chuman Pan-African flag\u201d on the Mall. (Protesters were given red, black, and green banners to create the flag, which was designed to represent people of the African Diaspora.)<\/p>\n<p>But in addition to rallies against racism, a group of a few dozen Trump supporters marched past the National Museum of African American History and Culture in the early afternoon, some flashing a hand sign known to symbolize white power, flanked by a group of Metropolitan Police Department officers on bicycles.<\/p>\n<p>Some members of the group carried an insignia associated with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/extremist-files\/group\/proud-boys\">Proud Boys<\/a>, a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group affiliated with white nationalist and alt-right extremist views.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the day, there were occasional clashes between supporters of the president and protesters with the Black Lives Matter movement, though perhaps none quite so dramatic as the scene near the Washington Monument around 9 p.m. In addition to a battle of chants and heated arguments, there were also some physical confrontations.<\/p>\n<p>In Garret Dufresne\u2019s telling, Trump supporters were \u201ctaking video and harassing peaceful protesters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The 25-year-old former grocery store worker said he drove 36 hours from Seattle to be in the nation\u2019s capital, his voice hoarse from \u201cyelling all day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI came here to protest police injustice. I drove all the way across America to protest,\u201d Dufresne said. \u201cI felt like Independence Day, it\u2019s the best opportunity to try to take back our rights as Americans. We were founded on freedom, but it was actually freedom supported by slaves. So we need to make reparations for all the harm that we have done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Diane Atkins, a municipal worker from Brooklyn, New York, said she came to celebrate the holiday with \u201cfellow patriots\u201d and to support the president. She dismissed the demonstrators as \u201cMarxists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not about racial equality, this is not about justice. This is about people that want anarchy. We can\u2019t allow it. We\u2019re a country of law and order,\u201d said Atkins, shortly after pepper spraying several protesters. She alleged they tried to rip her phone out of her hands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Fourth of July is a beautiful celebration to remember that we are all born free and we are all Americans and I wish that everybody would come together under the American flag,\u201d Atkins added.<\/p>\n<p>After the U.S. Park Police broke up the groups and the fireworks drowned out the chanting, the conflagration fizzled relatively quickly.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4856250\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1034px;\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4856250\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2020\/07\/WhatsApp-Image-2020-07-04-at-6.15.53-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jamel Mims, a New York artists, speaks to the crowd ahead of a flag burning on July 4, 2020.<br \/>\n<span class=\"credits\">Daniella Cheslow \/ WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h4>At BLM Plaza, both unity and debate over tactics<\/h4>\n<p>Meanwhile, over at Black Lives Matter Plaza as the fireworks began, some people offered a counter narrative in the form of Lift Every Voice and Sing, the Black national anthem. Others opted instead to chant \u201cfuck your fireworks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The plaza largely hosted tension-free protests, but a series of small confrontations played out throughout the day, a microcosm of ongoing debate about the right tactics to confront white supremacy.<\/p>\n<p>Just before the official Fourth of July military flyovers began, a small group of protesters gathered for a \u201cFlag-Burning Challenge,\u201d where they set small U.S. flags alight before eventually <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ABC7Kevin\/status\/1279569876651311105\">torching a larger flag<\/a> that was laying on the ground. The event <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FordFischer\/status\/1279555986458423296\">sparked a brief scuffle<\/a>, as other protesters tried to stop the flag-burning from happening.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is what they want, don\u2019t give it to them,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aletweetsnews\/status\/1279568555839819783\">said one person<\/a>, alluding to how the act could generate negative coverage of the movement. (Stories about the flag-burning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/far-left-activists-dance-on-american-flag-f-the-4th-of-july-f-the-american-flag?%3Futm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dwtwitter\">quickly started circulating in right-wing media<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>But for Jamel Mims of the New York City Revolution Club, burning the U.S. flag was justifiable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[Trump has] fucking called us terrorists, and called those people, that lynch mob that he\u2019s enabled, \u2018fine people.\u2019 And so those fireworks represent a fucking disgrace, and that flag represents the ugly history of that country and its ugly present,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only one way to properly display it: fucking on fire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(A group, which included the man whose Supreme Court case enshrined the right to burn the flag, also lit the star spangled banner on fire <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/07\/04\/what-were-watching-for-as-july-fourth-unfolds\/\">last year on July 4<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>A while later, protesters <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jennygathright\/status\/1279579357510590464\">confronted a group of what appeared to be Black Israelites<\/a>, accusing them of homophobia and transphobia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf all Black lives matter, that includes gay people, that includes trans people. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are,\u201d said Carleen Donawa. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit here and spread hate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And around 10:40 p.m., a group of Trump supporters walked through Black Lives Matter Plaza, only for protesters to escort them out. When another person walked through, a protester threw his red hat over a fence.<\/p>\n<p>Some wanted to get more physical with the president\u2019s supporters, while others just wanted to help facilitate their exit. (Police eventually formed a line to prevent the Trump supporters from reentering the plaza on Vermont Avenue.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a group of demonstrators ended the night united in one tactic: jointly occupying 16th Street, which has been aggressively cleared by police in recent days. They set up around 20 tents the area around St. John\u2019s Church, with plans to remain there indefinitely.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne giant protest is awesome, but after that day everyone goes back to their regular shit and they feel like they have the power to do exactly what they did all over again,\u201d said Eugene Kinlow, who pledged to stick with the encampment. \u201cConsistency is what\u2019s going to make them \u2014 the government, the police, the mayor \u2014 understand that we are unhappy with the system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a

But they left the words.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser did not respond to a request for comment about the decision, or how she planned to proceed with the unsanctioned addition.<\/p>\n<p>During an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday morning, she was evasive when asked if she would remove the message.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not a part of the mural and we certainly encourage expression, but we are using the city streets for city art,\u201d Bowser said. When pressed further, the mayor said she hasn\u2019t \u201ceven had the chance to review it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The original mural has received international attention, and no less than civil rights icon John Lewis visited the street, which has been newly rechristened \u201cBlack Lives Matter Plaza,\u201d where he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MurielBowser\/status\/1269618105245937665\">took a photo with Bowser<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The mayor called the original mural an \u201caffirmative piece of art,\u201d and said people from around the globe had called to thank the city \u201cfor acknowledging black humanity and black lives in the most important city in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But local activists were quick to criticize the effort. The D.C. chapter of Black Lives Matter called it \u201cperformative\u201d and a distraction from the mayor\u2019s failure to make substantive changes to the city\u2019s criminal justice system.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBlack people are allowed to be joyful or feel seen with DC renaming a street after Black Lives Matter,\u201d Kiki Green, a core organizer with Black Lives Matter DC said in an emailed statement to the group\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s also our responsibility to let you know what we are fighting for, who has the power to change things and that power concedes nothing without demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5941924\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5941924\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-1500x1125.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-900x675.jpeg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-600x450.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/defund-the-policec-mural-1-1-1600x1200.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Demonstrators paint \u201cDefund the Police\u201d on 16th Street on June 7.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Rachel Kurzius \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtoncitypaper.com\/news\/city-desk\/article\/21136115\/the-movement-to-defund-dc-police\">group has called for<\/a> a ban on stop and frisk, no new jails in the District, defunding D.C. police, and other changes.<\/p>\n<p>In that same statement, Black Lives Matter DC named black men who have been killed by D.C. police, writing: \u201cWe hold that we have a duty to the loved ones named above to ensure that they are not forgotten and their deaths are not exploited for publicity, performance, or distraction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One the artists who painted the words \u201cDefund the Police\u201d says they considered different ways to transform Bowser\u2019s original mural. Turning the flag into an equal sign seemed like the best way to \u201ctake the message that was there and turn it into our message,\u201d says the artist, who didn\u2019t want to be identified to avoid taking credit for the work of a group.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the city repainted the stars, he\u2019s glad the words are still there to communicate the message.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you defund the police, you\u2019re able to invest in black communities and black futures,\u201d he says. \u201cI think [Bowser] realizes that\u2019s it\u2019s a message that\u2019s resonating around the country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A number of protesters also shared conflicting reactions, many wrestling with both the public symbolism and the practical reality.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m torn,\u201d Marcia Santos, from Gaithersburg, said Sunday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful thing that has happened. But \u2026 I\u2019m trying to see change happen, and this doesn\u2019t happen by putting up a sign for \u2026 Black Lives Matter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Johnnie Williams echoed that sentiment as he provided water and snacks at the plaza on Sunday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we appreciate the small gestures of the Black Lives Matter Plaza, painting the streets, that doesn\u2019t mean anything for substantive change and accountability,\u201d he said, citing Bowser\u2019s proposed increases in the police department\u2019s budget.<\/p>\n<p>He believes the activists\u2019 addition of \u201cdefund the police\u201d should be allowed to stay. \u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all have the freedom of rights and speech, we should be able to say what we need to say,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBecause if we were really having an honest conversation, we would be talking about the militarization of police, which has been happening across this country for the past 10, 15 years since the Department Of Homeland Security was created.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Trey Williamson, who biked in from Northern Virginia with his friend Holston Camp, said he greatly appreciated the original work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the fact that it\u2019s there really sends the message that black lives really do matter, and then seeing the diversity that\u2019s been out here for 12 days, and everybody supporting that,\u201d Williamson said, adding that it has been particularly heartening as he nears 50. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this all my life. My three kids, who I thought would never have to deal with racism, have all gone through it. So, for me to see this mass amount of people out here and that message, I think it really puts a statement on that it really does matter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The friends generally disagreed with the sentiment of defunding the police, saying that it should instead go to better training.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe don\u2019t speak for everybody. You know, everybody\u2019s got their own opinion. But I agree with my boy, you know, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily necessarily say defund,\u201d Camp said. \u201cI\u00a0would just say move the funding in the right direction\u2014eliminate that chokehold, teach him how to interact better with everyone.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But since Friday, other demonstrators have also scrawled messages on the massive yellow letters of the Black Lives Matter mural, with messages like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mcbyrne\/status\/1269102901756035074\">\u201cnot good enough\u201d<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PerryStein\/status\/1269420482232754179\">\u201cf**k the \u2018mural,\u2019 change the system.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p>While the additions to the mural on 16th Street received the most attention, they weren\u2019t the only messages that activists left for D.C.\u2019s politicians on the city\u2019s streets. Protesters painted a second \u201cDefund the Police\u201d mural outside the Wilson Building, where the D.C. Council meets. At one point, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/geoliv\/49979864598\/in\/pool-dcist\/\">protesters laid around the words<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The legislative body is <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/04\/dc-council-chokehold-ban-police-reform-bill\/\">set to take up a bill this week<\/a> that would ban the use of chokeholds, speed up the public release of footage from body-cameras, require that police officers involved in shooting deaths or other serious uses of force be named, and other steps.<\/p>\n<p><em>Julie Strupp contributed reporting.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated with a reaction from one of the artists behind the addition to the mural.\u00a0<\/em><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">It originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/07\/activists-added-defund-the-police-to-the-new-black-lives-matter-mural-so-far-d-c-officials-have-let-it-stay\/\">DCist<\/a>.<\/i><\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning reporting and programs upon which you\u2019ve come to expect and rely, including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, 1A, The Politics Hour with Kojo Nnamdi, shows from the WAMU Podcast Team, and many more!<\/p>\n\t\t<p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a href=\"\/donate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button-donate\"><svg class=\"wamu-icon\"><use xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#wamu-heart\"><\/use><\/svg>Donate<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Activists also removed the stars from the D.C. flag, which city workers repainted on Sunday morning. <\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/06\/08\/activists-painted-defund-the-police-next-to-the-new-black-lives-matter-mural\/","currentSlug":"activists-painted-defund-the-police-next-to-the-new-black-lives-matter-mural","created":"2020-06-08T11:00:45","modified":"2020-06-18T18:01:30","time":"Jun 08, 2020","timestamp":1591614045,"timestampGMT":1591628445,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>A woman stands on the freshly repainted stars in the &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; mural on 16th Street on June 7.

Today, Diane continues to seek out insightful, well-informed guests who can help her, and her listeners, sift through the noise of the news media to get the answers they need and deserve.<\/p>\r\nFor 37 years, The Diane Rehm Show offered listeners thoughtful and lively conversations on an array of topics with many of the most distinguished people of our times.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
