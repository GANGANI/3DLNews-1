Abortion rights supporters banged on drums and led chants, including \u201cNever again, we won\u2019t go back!\u201d and \u201cWhat do we want? Choice! When do we want it? Always!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the crowd was peaceful, there was outrage in the air as people confronted a future without a right that has been guaranteed for the past five decades. Where earlier in the day pro- and anti-abortion protesters demonstrated at the court in roughly equal numbers, by about 7 p.m. the crowd was almost entirely in favor of abortion rights.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday I\u2019m fucking angry. We have been betrayed yet again by the government that we have put in power,\u201d said Afeni, a core organizer with Freedom Fighters DC, one of the groups rallying protesters to the court.<\/p>\n<p>Speakers with the abolitionist group Harriet\u2019s Wildest Dreams linked the fight for abortion rights with the fight for Black liberation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBlack bodies are under attack,\u201d said one of the group\u2019s co-conductors, Nee Nee Taylor, speaking to the crowd. \u201cThe most attacked person behind this decision is the Black woman.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not going to turn back. Abortion by any means necessary!\u201d Taylor said, to cheers.<\/p>\n<p>As Taylor spoke, officers with the U.S. Capitol Police stood behind the stage in yellow vests. Officers had been present at the Supreme Court all day Friday, some in riot gear. As night fell officers on bicycles fell into formation in front of the Capitol and followed <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/esilverman11\/status\/1540499148402827265?s=21&amp;t=Rdiaprp2kfY5NMOTkW6ANQ\">protesters who marched through downtown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many demonstrators still seemed to be in disbelief over the ruling, despite the fact that it had been all but guaranteed ever since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/05\/02\/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473\">a draft decision was leaked<\/a> in early May.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of eloquent words today, I\u2019m just unbelievably pissed,\u201d said Amy Callner. Callner, a resident of Prince George\u2019s County, carried a sign with the names of the five conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, reading, \u201cA bunch of assholes. Fuck you, seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about babies,\u201d Callner said. \u201cIf it were about babies, we\u2019d have things like parental leave, we\u2019d have universal health care, we\u2019d have fucking baby formula.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fifty-years ago, Rosie Sauser was at another Roe-related protest: she said her mother dragged her to an anti-abortion march after the Supreme Court affirmed a woman\u2019s right to abortion in 1973.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, the Kalorama resident stood on the opposite side of history, joining abortion rights protestors outside the Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere we are with the same issue,\u201d Sauser said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unlike some parts of the country, the D.C. region will not see any immediate changes in abortion access following the ruling \u2013 13 states have \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2022\/06\/24\/abortion-state-laws-criminalization-roe\/\">trigger laws<\/a>\u201d on the books that immediately clamp down on abortions following any ruling that strikes down Roe.<\/p>\n<p>But the future for abortion access in the D.C. area is far from certain.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2022\/06\/24\/virginia-youngkin-abortion-15-week-ruling\/\">reportedly asked lawmakers<\/a> to draft legislation banning abortion after 15 weeks, mirroring the Mississippi law that the Supreme Court upheld Friday in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health ruling.<\/p>\n<p>In D.C., while local officials are staunchly pro-abortion rights, they could be overruled by Congress if Republicans take control of both chambers in 2024. Congressional Republicans have a long history of working to curtail abortion rights in the District, including by banning the city from using Medicaid dollars to fund abortions. Because it\u2019s not a state, the District has limited power to protect its local laws, though several local elected officials on Friday expressed their commitment to try.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWashington, DC is a proud pro-choice city and access to abortion is still legal here,\u201d Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis is about health care. This is about women\u2019s rights. This is about bodily autonomy. A majority of Americans believe in a woman\u2019s right to choose. This fight is urgent but not over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Maryland, abortion access is protected by a 1992 constitutional referendum that enshrined the right in state law. In a statement on Friday, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he planned to hold to that referendum and stay away from legislating abortion policy.<\/p>\n<p>A number of people in the crowd wore red dresses and white bonnets, a nod to the Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian novel that depicts an ultra-religious society where women lose autonomy over their bodies.<\/p>\n<p>One person in Handmaid\u2019s garb stood before the fence blocking access to the court, holding a sign reading, \u201cThis is <em>not<\/em> fiction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book that I read as a teenager,\u201d said Ongisa Ichile-Mckenzie, also dressed in Handmaid red and white. Her sign, hastily written in blue ink letters, said \u201cFuck Gilead,\u201d refering to the fictional name the U.S. is given after it is overtaken by Christian fundamentalists in Atwood\u2019s book.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI see that our country is turning into that, and how easily a work of fiction could be manifest in our daily lives,\u201d Ichile-Mckenzie said.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a handful of anti-abortion demonstrators remained outside the court, dwindling from the crowd of 100 or so who were celebrating earlier in the day when the decision has handed down.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAbortion is now going back into the hands of the people,\u201d said Cassie Pfitzenmeier, a D.C. resident and member of the anti-abortion group Bound4Life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur organization has been out here for 18 years,\u201d Pfitzenmeier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying for this day. It\u2019s overwhelming, that\u2019s the only word I can come up with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the evening wore on, opposing protesters occasionally got into confrontations, yelling at one another and eventually being separated by police. The protest remained peaceful through the evening.<\/p>\n<p>Small marches began to form as the sun set and protesters set off around downtown, including <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aletweetsnews\/status\/1540504363537469441\">past D.C. police headquarters.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The city is expecting further demonstrations in the following hours and days. The Metropolitan Police Department plans to employ \u201cfull departmental activation\u201d through Tuesday, June 28 in anticipation of continuing local protests, the department said in a statement Friday. Federal law enforcement is working with local police.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Abortion rights supporters banged on drums and led chants, including &#8220;Never again, we won&#8217;t go back!&#8221; and \u201cWhat do we want?

But as Goldson considered how she could keep families safe and slow the virus\u2019 spread without disrupting learning, she made a decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe only way was to pull the trigger on virtual,\u201d she recalled in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>The call was not a popular one at the time, Goldson admitted. But she says the decision to temporarily shift the 131,000-student school system to virtual learning the week before winter break and for two weeks after likely shielded students and staff from the worst of the outbreak: while schools elsewhere in the region dealt with widespread quarantines and, in some instances, building closures triggered by ballooning case numbers, students and educators in Prince George\u2019s County simply stayed home.<\/p>\n<p>It was not the only time Goldson chose a more cautious route than superintendents and school boards elsewhere.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4948990\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4948990\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_FrederickDouglass_Turner_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1750\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Arianna Bosley, 12th grade, left, and Jalen Stephens, 10th grade, talk in the hallway at Frederick Douglass High School in Upper Marlboro, Md.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Prince George\u2019s was the last public school system in the Washington region to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.baltimoresun.com\/maryland\/laurel\/cng-ll-public-schools-reopen-20210331-fntahqritzfx3f2altrptlyase-story.html\">in-person learning<\/a> options to students in the 2020-21 academic year. Thousands of elementary students spent the first half of this year learning virtually. And the Maryland school system is still requiring masks, even as neighboring districts have dropped their mandates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am very cognizant of what\u2019s happening in surrounding areas,\u201d Goldson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t impact the decisions I make because I solely have to look at just Prince George\u2019s. Other districts, early on, their COVID numbers were just not as high as ours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The majority-Black county was scarred by illness and death in the first months of the pandemic, creating fear around in-person school. Families and educators say the careful strategy around running in-person school has built trust in the district , helping avoid clashes over in-person learning and masking that have divided other communities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Prince George\u2019s was hit so hard, our community has really embraced this conservative approach,\u201d said Donna Christy, president of the Prince George\u2019s County Education Association, a union that represents more than 10,000 educators. \u201cI think we made the best of a really bad situation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ernest Carter, the health officer for the Prince George\u2019s County Health Department, credited the county\u2019s cautious approach during the pandemic with helping curb death and hospitalization rates over time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are a little bit more conservative. We\u2019re very mindful of our population and its characteristics,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOur residents are mindful too. They are very aware of the situation that we were in \u2026 and how we got out of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4948995\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4948995\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_FrederickDouglass_Turner_06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Amiah Jones, 9th grade, second from right, talks about climate change during a social issues class at Frederick Douglass High School.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h4><strong>\u2018It was just very hard to see\u2019<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>On a recent morning at Frederick Douglass High School in Upper Marlboro, a group of about 20\u00a0students in a social issues class broke into a lively discussion about the dangers of global warming and advocating for change.<\/p>\n<p>Jaylyn Hewitt, a spirited 16-year-old in a Star Wars sweatshirt, stopped to make a point about burnout.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re focusing on climate change, while we\u2019re focusing on homelessness, while we\u2019re focusing on racism, we also need to be focusing on our own health and bettering the way we view life as a whole,\u201d Hewitt said as her classmates erupted into cheers and applause.<\/p>\n<p>Hewitt was speaking from personal experience.<\/p>\n<p>During the pandemic, the teenager said she consoled one friend whose grandmother died after contracting the coronavirus. Other friends had to move away because their families lost jobs during the pandemic and could no longer afford to live in Prince George\u2019s, one of the most affluent majority-Black counties in the country.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4948997\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4948997\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_FrederickDouglass_Turner_08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jaylyn Hewitt, 11th grade, at Frederick Douglass High School.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cIt was a whole bunch of people who would come to me and tell me about their problems,\u201d Hewitt said in an interview after class. \u201cIt was just very hard to see. Ninth grade \u2013 I was happy. We were all doing good. And to just see that collapse in the pandemic, it was just hard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That \u201ccollapse\u201d was evident at campuses across the school system \u2013 students struggled to cope with fear and grief as their communities were devastated by the worst effects of the virus, educators said.<\/p>\n<p>Prince George\u2019s, the second-most populous jurisdiction in Maryland, has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the state, surpassing its larger neighbor, Montgomery County. Longstanding racial and health inequities played out here as they had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/09\/23\/914427907\/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen\">across the country<\/a>: Black and Latino residents suffered a disproportionate impact from the virus, becoming sick more often and getting sicker when they did.<\/p>\n<p>That led to significant consequences for a school system where the majority of students are Black and Latino. Many students had grandparents or parents who contracted the virus, educators say, leading to hospitalizations and some deaths.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou would have students emailing you weekly being like, \u2018I can\u2019t attend virtual learning because I\u2019m going to this funeral,\u2019\u201d said Erin McCarty, a history teacher at Frederick Douglass who teaches the social issues class.<\/p>\n<p>Some of McCarty\u2019s strongest students stopped completing assignments, she said. Conducting classes virtually felt like a \u201cseance\u201d \u2013 the teacher found herself calling out students\u2019 names to make sure they were following along with their cameras turned off.<\/p>\n<p>Families shared obituaries of loved ones with the school, said Principal Eddie Scott. One father who was hospitalized in an intensive care unit after contracting the coronavirus told the principal his daughter was \u201cnot in a position to learn\u201d because she faced significant anxiety over the situation.<\/p>\n<p>Sixty-five students are repeating ninth grade this year because they did not earn enough credits last year to advance to tenth grade, which is about three times as many students in a typical year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4949000\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4949000\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_FrederickDouglass_Turner_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1690\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">School counselor Miaela Thomas in her office at Frederick Douglass High School.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Students returned for in-person learning in August with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Teenagers experienced panic attacks in classrooms, according to Miaela Thomas, a counselor Frederick Douglass hired at the start of the school year.<\/p>\n<p>Teenagers cannot be expected to perform academically if they are struggling with mental health, Thomas said. So she established a hotline where students can reach her during and after school to talk or schedule wellness visits.<\/p>\n<p>More than 100 texts have arrived since the start of the year, including one from a student who attempted to take her life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHad we not known through this text message system, it could have been bad. She knew who to reach out to, she knew who to contact to get help,\u201d Thomas recalled.<\/p>\n<p>So even as vaccines have become widely available and death and hospitalization rates have declined, Scott said families at Frederick Douglass remain cautious about the pandemic and support mitigation measures such as the mask requirement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople in our community don\u2019t want to relive that kind of experience,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4948989\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4948989\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_FrederickDouglass_Turner_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1578\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Principal Eddie Scott talks to students before the start of classes at Frederick Douglass High School in Upper Marlboro, MD.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Teenagers readily comply with the mask requirement.

And during the omicron surge this winter, parents peppered school administrators with questions about their plans for keeping students safe.<\/p>\n<p>Eleventh grader Isaiah Butler said he still limits interactions with people he does not know for fear of contracting the virus. Butler watched his younger sister become sick with COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was nauseous like all the time. Headaches. Stomachaches for about two weeks,\u201d the teenager recalled. \u201cWhen you see people go through it and when you live through it, it really does do something to you.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Addressing loss<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Throughout the pandemic groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, a leading physicians group, have stressed the academic and social benefits of in-person learning.<\/p>\n<p>Still, about 12,000 students in kindergarten through sixth grade in Prince George\u2019s decided to learn online for the first two quarters of the 2021-2022 academic year. That made the county an outlier in the Washington region \u2013 most other local school systems educated far fewer students online, limiting virtual instruction to students with qualifying health conditions or other extenuating circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Leading up to the school year, Goldson said she was inundated with messages from parents of young children who did not feel comfortable sending their children back to in-person school before they became eligible for a vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy soul wasn\u2019t settled. I could sense the anxiety for parents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I put myself in their shoes \u2013 if I had a child that age, what would make me feel comfortable?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Maryland, results on standardized tests administered this spring will provide the fullest picture of where students stand academically since the public health crisis began.<\/p>\n<p>The state waived the annual tests in 2020 because of the pandemic, and administered an abbreviated version of the exams known as the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program in the fall of 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Scores on those tests, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.baltimoresun.com\/education\/bs-md-mcap-data-20220224-20220225-ciaf3g37kzardj3dlmejunclqy-story.html\">state leaders said<\/a> were only intended to provide a snapshot of the pandemic\u2019s effects on learning, showed steep declines in student performance on math and English exams.<\/p>\n<p>In Prince George\u2019s, results on those tests painted clear challenges: for example, 13 percent of students in third grade demonstrated proficiency in reading and 5 percent or less of students were proficient in math.<\/p>\n<p>At Princeton Elementary School in Camp Springs, educators say they do not need test results to understand that students are struggling academically.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4949001\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4949001\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_Princeton_Turner_12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1668\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Principal Jessica Coley greets students as they arrive for in-person learning at Princeton Elementary School in Camp Springs, Md.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Even before the pandemic, students at Princeton did not perform well on state tests. In 2019, fewer than 18% of students were considered proficient in math and reading, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Principal Jessica Coley said online instruction was no match for face to face interactions with teachers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that there\u2019s learning loss,\u201d she said. \u201cNo ifs, ands, or buts about it. We see it in the way in which students are performing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some teachers instructed children concurrently, with some students learning in person and others logging on from home. The school system paid teachers up to $7,500 extra if they taught in person and virtually at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Douglas Hernandez, who teaches English as a second language, said 11 of the 12 children in his kindergarten class stayed virtual for the first half of the year. In first grade, 13 students in a class of 19 learned remotely.<\/p>\n<p>Children who attended his class in person have performed better than those who started the year virtually. Those who logged on to class struggled heavily with writing, he noticed. The teacher spent class asking students to point their paper toward computer screens so he could read words they wrote, reminding them to capitalize letters at the start of each sentence.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4949004\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4949004\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_Princeton_Turner_14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1668\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">A young student gathers her things before heading to her classroom at the start of the school day at Princeton Elementary School.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cThey had learned that but they were forgetting. They were not practicing,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI had to be on them a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many immigrant parents knew their children were not performing well online, but viewed virtual learning as a way to protect their families, Hernandez said. A majority of English learners at Princeton speak Spanish as their first language. Others speak Urdu and Tagalog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have lost family here and in their [home] countries [to COVID],\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cMany people died, grandpas, uncles, cousins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When the school system ended the virtual option for elementary school students in January, some parents hesitated to send their children back to Princeton. Those families were not alone \u2013 a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/prince-george-s-county-public-schools-keep-pgcps-virtual-learning-program-for-remainder-of-2021-2022-school-year\">countywide petition<\/a> urging Goldson to maintain the virtual option until the end of the academic year garnered more than 1,670 signatures.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\"><\/div>\n<p>The school system\u2019s mask mandate has also created some challenges for teachers, but educators and parents still say the benefits of gaining community trust and making families feel safe are worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Cama Kalee Wilson, the lead reading instructor at Princeton, wears a KN95 mask every day. But the face covering muffles her voice, making it harder for young students to distinguish between similar sounds such as \u201cba\u201d and \u201cpa.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So Wilson purchased a portable speaker and microphone, carrying it as she teaches to amplify her voice. She still supports the school system\u2019s mask mandate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in a pandemic,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Jennifer Jones, whose son attends Princeton, said she has taken more risks than other parents during the pandemic when it comes to her child\u2019s education. She enrolled her son in daycare when an in-person option for preschool was not available because she felt it was crucial for his development.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4949011\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4949011\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/05\/20220408_Princeton_Turner_19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Kindergarten teacher, Randi Thompson, works with one of her kindergarten students at the board.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But Jones said she does not begrudge the school system for taking a cautious approach to running campuses during the public health crisis. She does not understand how other parents could force their demands on school leaders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly they\u2019re doing the best they can,\u201d said Jones, who teaches physical education at Princeton. \u201cIt\u2019s like sometimes people are so entitled and they want everything the way they want it instead of thinking of the greater good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nearly 20 miles away at Mount Rainier Elementary School, Timothy Meyer, the president of the school\u2019s parent-teacher organization, said some parents in the community wanted the school system to return to full in-person learning for all students sooner.<\/p>\n<p>About 40 students started the year virtually, Meyer said, but many of those families decided to send their children back in person within a few weeks of the start of the school year.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part Meyer said the school system has avoided charged confrontations over reopening that have unfolded elsewhere in the Washington region.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\"><\/div>\n<p>In the District, the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union and school system officials <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/local\/305\/2020\/10\/22\/926650171\/labor-board-ruling-may-complicate-d-c-p-s-plans-to-welcome-back-some-students\">repeatedly clashed<\/a> over when and how to reopen buildings. In Fairfax and Arlington counties, parent groups formed to pressure leaders into opening schools. And in Northern Virginia, the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/01\/21\/northern-virginia-schools-resist-lifting-mask-mandate\/\">battle over masking<\/a> polarized some communities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have parents at school board meetings shouting about kids being unmasked and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way that I\u2019ve tried to approach this is \u2013 if you have to choose between a little bit of inconvenience or people possibly losing their lives, you need to take the inconvenience every time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Back at Princeton, Coley, the principal, still believes the caution around running schools in the county has been necessary, even if it meant many of her students spent 20 months outside of a physical classroom.<\/p>\n<p>She understands firsthand the anxiety in her school community. Coley\u2019s father was diagnosed with cancer in July 2020. Before he died, she feared infecting him with the virus and making him sicker.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been hard to lead when there is such a significant absence in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m able to relate with many of my families.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Moving forward, Coley is optimistic. With all students back in person, administrators and school leaders are now working to identify students who need extra support.<\/p>\n<p>On the day before spring break, Coley stood outside the school as children arrived, welcoming them in pink bunny glasses and wishing them a Happy Easter. She doled out elbow bumps as children hustled into the building.<\/p>\n<p>She directed one girl who arrived without a face mask to another school worker, who supplied a disposable pink mask with cartoon pandas printed on it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt will take us some time to get through this,\u201d Coley said. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4949010\"

has people fully masked and on the other side of the room, it\u2019s mostly people who are unmasked,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Montgomery County Public Schools, like many school systems\u00a0<a

data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\">across the country<\/a> and the D.C. region, lifted its mask requirement on campuses last month. The decision to do so matches recently updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says universal masking in schools is not necessary when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/science\/community-levels.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">community COVID-19 levels<\/a> are low or moderate.<\/p>\n<p>The shift arrived as a welcome change for some families, who worried face masks interfered with their children\u2019s learning and comfort levels at school. They feel the availability of vaccines for people 5 and older, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/05\/21\/999241558\/in-kids-the-risk-of-covid-19-and-the-flu-are-similar-but-the-risk-perception-isn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relatively low risk<\/a> for severe illness among young children who contract COVID-19, is enough to return schools to normalcy.<\/p>\n<p>But not everyone has embraced the change.<\/p>\n<p>Some students and families still fear bringing the virus home to immunocompromised family members, or would like to continue mitigation efforts to avoid getting sick themselves. And while more cautious students say they try to respect others\u2019 choices, they worry the decision to lift mandates was premature.<\/p>\n<p>The choice to mask or not can vary by school, classroom or between individual students. At one elementary school in the District, parents say most children are happily moving through the hallways, bare faced. At another elementary school, five miles away, an 8-year-old says she and most of her classmates are continuing to mask.<\/p>\n<p>Vencill, who continues to double mask at Poolesville, said she tries to transition between classes as quickly as possible, careful to avoid clusters of maskless students. She worries lifting the mandate too soon will cause an increase in COVID cases.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy whole thought process around mask mandates is that there\u2019s no harm in having them but there is harm in not having them,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Arjun Rao, a ninth-grade student at Poolesville who organized a walkout earlier this year to call for more COVID safety protocols, said the decision by the county school board to lift the mandate has not created as many issues as he initially feared.<\/p>\n<p>Still Rao, who continues to mask, said many students have established informal expectations in their social groups. For example, Rao said students who participate in drama have agreed to mask around each other, with some exceptions for when the teenagers are acting on stage.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an official thing but it\u2019s an expectation,\u201d Rao explained.<\/p>\n<p>At Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, CJ MacDonald said signs are plastered to walls that declare, \u201cMask on or off, it\u2019s just me. Respect my decision.\u201d The fifteen-year-old estimated about half the students at Walter Johnson are still masking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do understand respecting people\u2019s decisions but having students uncomfortable with it can get weird,\u201d they said. \u201cWith some people at my school who I know are around a lot of people who aren\u2019t vaccinated, I\u2019m like \u2018hey, when we\u2019re around each other can you please put on your mask.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>MacDonald contracted COVID-19 in January, shortly after returning to school from winter break. Their sense of taste disappeared for about a month.<\/p>\n<p>In the District, Neveah Bright, an 11th grade student at Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in Takoma, said most students have continued to wear masks even though D.C. Public Schools <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/03\/11\/dc-public-schools-mask-mandate-lifted\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made face coverings optional last month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The 16-year-old said some of her peers feel masks are important tools for sustaining in-person learning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey feel that taking the mask mandate away can cause a spike in COVID cases and they don\u2019t want to be in the same predicament of not being in school again,\u201d said Bright, who sits on a committee that advises the State Board of Education.<\/p>\n<p>To others the decision by D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee to lift the school system\u2019s masking requirement in mid-March was a necessary change.<\/p>\n<p>Mourad Moursi said he saw his older child, a fourth grade student at Powell Elementary School in Petworth, started to develop a \u201cphobia\u201d with germs. He said she grew anxious about removing her mask even outdoors, where coronavirus transmission is far less likely.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat was something that really got me worried,\u201d Moursi said. \u201cThis idea that she\u2019s going to develop this phobia around germs that she never had before and the fact that she was hiding behind her masks in some social situations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Moursi, who is among a group of parents who pushed the city to lift its mask requirement in schools, said his daughter gradually became more comfortable with removing her mask after she saw some of her classmates and teachers do it.<\/p>\n<p>At Janney Elementary School in Tenleytown, parent Tamar Levenberg said most children are going without masks. Levenberg started pushing city officials to lift its mask mandate in schools once they were no longer required in settings such as grocery stores.<\/p>\n<p>Levenberg\u2019s younger son, a kindergartener at Janney, had a speech delay. The masks made school more challenging, she said, because her son wasn\u2019t able to see other people\u2019s facial expressions and decipher non-verbal cues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor him, having trouble with articulation, not being able to see the way that people formed sounds really impacted his frustration level and him feeling like he wasn\u2019t being understood,\u201d the mother said.<\/p>\n<p>Another parent at Janney, Elizabeth Mitchell, said \u201cthe majority of the school is unmasked and thrilled to be so.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s family is not in the majority \u2013 the mother said her two children have decided to stay masked because they often visit their grandparents.<\/p>\n<p>The children\u2019s grandfather is immunocompromised, Mitchell said, which is why she has opted to continue masking when she picks her children up from school. But she said she\u2019s had other parents approach her twice and question her choice to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Mitchell worries her children will face bullying for masking. She said she has felt increasingly isolated in the school community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like there was a lot of sympathy for my situation last year \u2013 having a parent with cancer who I had to take care of,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just feels like this collective good that we all entered the pandemic with has slowly waned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not all schools in the D.C. region have gone mask optional. Some charter schools in the District have maintained mandates, including KIPP D.C., the city\u2019s largest charter operator.<\/p>\n<p>In a survey of 350 staff members and more than 450 families, 53% of staff and 79% of families urged KIPP D.C. to keep the requirement, according to an email sent to the school community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand this also means a large number of staff and families feel masks should be optional,\u201d the message said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor COVID data, schools in the District where masks are now optional, and input we are hearing from our community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some parents are frustrated that not all students have the option of removing their masks.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Fraioli, the parent of a kindergartener at Washington Yu Ying Public Charter School, said the school recently announced it will go mask optional on April 25 \u2014 about one month after D.C. Health told scho<\/p>\n<p>Fraioli worries masking has interfered with his son\u2019s ability to learn Chinese at Yu Ying, which is a dual language immersion school. And he said he worries the prolonged use of masks is producing unnecessary anxiety for children.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThroughout the pandemic, there\u2019s been a refrain from some people that kids are resilient and that kids are adaptable,\u201d he said. \u201cI tend to view that sentiment skeptically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Public school students in Prince George\u2019s County are also continuing to mask. Monica Goldson, the county school system\u2019s CEO, told families she would follow previous guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education and remove the district\u2019s mask mandate once 80% of residents are fully vaccinated.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview, Goldson said she factored vaccination rates among young children into her decision to keep masks. Fewer than 40% of children between 5 and 11-years-old in Prince George\u2019s have received a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Goldson.<\/p>\n<p>Goldson, who plans to reexamine the decision to keep the requirement in early April, said she is also keeping close watch of how the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/03\/29\/1089494990\/the-more-contagious-ba-2-version-of-omicron-is-now-the-most-common-in-the-u-s\">BA.2 strain<\/a> of the Omicron variant will affect the region.<\/p>\n<p>She said many parents and staff have urged her to maintain the mandate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to keep kids in schools daily,\u201d she said. \u201cStudents are moving on like masks are part of their clothing. They\u2019re not stopping from the learning process, it\u2019s not hindering their ability to learn.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Some families have welcomed the decision to lift

Teachers\u2019 Union explained","content":"<p>During one week this January, a group of educators in the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23itsnotsafe%20%40dc_core&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted selfies<\/a> to Twitter from inside classrooms, accompanying the images with #It\u2019sNotSafe. They rallied outside D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s office alongside substitute teachers, who were demanding higher pay.<\/p>\n<p>And they encouraged educators to wear red in solidarity with the Red for Ed movement, a national campaign for more school funding sparked in 2018 after teachers across West Virginia walked out of school buildings in protest.<\/p>\n<p>The activities by educators in the District were not officially endorsed by the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, an alliance that represents 5,100 educators in D.C. Public Schools. They were organized by DC-CORE, a caucus formed by educators frustrated by the way the union has handled the pandemic and other issues.<\/p>\n<p>DC-CORE, which stands for the D.C. Caucus of Rank &amp; File Educators, argues the union is not doing enough to engage its members and challenge school system leaders. Organizers say they want to build a union led by its members and driven by social justice causes.<\/p>\n<p>The caucus is fighting for many of the same issues the union has already sought to address, including amplifying the voices of Black and brown educators and reducing standardized testing. Another top priority is ending mayoral control of schools.<\/p>\n<p>But, like similar groups that have formed elsewhere in the country, the caucus has demonstrated a greater willingness to publicly confront and chastise city leaders to achieve its goals.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s inflamed tensions within the union \u2013 some educators say members in the caucus can alienate their colleagues, some of whom must represent the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union in negotiations with the school system. Critics also argue the group is sowing division in the teachers group during a year when the organization is expected to elect a new president.<\/p>\n<p>The discord has led to clashes among some union members, fueling disagreements in Zoom meetings that have spiraled into personal attacks.<\/p>\n<p>Members of DC-CORE say the way the union has operated is not effective. They point to the fact that the union is still locked in negotiations with D.C. Public Schools over a labor contract that expired three years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to tear anyone down or rip the union apart or be a separate union,\u201d said Laura Fuchs, a founding member of DC-CORE. \u201cWe just have really strong beliefs on what makes a strong union and we\u2019re just trying to use the democratic process to achieve those.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pushing for a more \u2018activist\u2019 union<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since forming in the summer of 2020, members of DC-CORE have organized some of the most visible demonstrations over health and safety measures in schools during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>They laid \u201cbody bags\u201d outside the school system\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/debbietruong\/status\/1287812716950884352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">administrative offices<\/a> to protest plans to return to in-person learning before vaccines were available.<\/p>\n<p>They spearheaded a \u201csick out\u201d where teachers were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/local\/305\/2020\/11\/03\/930899805\/after-fierce-pushback-d-c-public-schools-delays-plans-to-reopen-elementary-schools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">encouraged to take a mental health day<\/a> as part of a broader push to delay the reopening of schools.<\/p>\n<p>And they coordinated caravans to protest outside the homes of Bowser and D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4941278\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4941278\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/02\/IMG_1351-2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Members of DC-CORE, a caucus in the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, laid \u201cbody bags\u201d outside the administrative offices of D.C. Public Schools in July 2020.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Steve Donkin, a founding member of DC-CORE, said educators felt city leaders were not listening to teachers and parents who expressed fears about reopening campuses for the 2020-2021 academic year. Many also felt leaders of the union did not do enough to convey those messages to city officials.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of members felt like they wanted more support for what they were voicing \u2014 their concerns and their desires to be more of an activist, fighting union,\u201d said Donkin, a teacher at Francis L. Cardozo High School in Columbia Heights. \u201cThat was kind of the germ of forming the caucus \u2014 to try and push the union more in that activist direction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jacqueline Pogue Lyons, president of the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, rejected the notion that the labor organization is not active enough, and pointed to some recent successes.<\/p>\n<p>She said the union\u2019s advocacy led to a promise from D.C. Public Schools to <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/09\/27\/new-funding-puts-a-librarian-in-every-dcps-school\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">employ a librarian<\/a> at every campus. The union also secured COVID leave for educators and time off for teachers to get the coronavirus vaccine during the work day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re more active than we\u2019ve ever been and I\u2019d say it\u2019s largely been pushed by our members, by the leaders of our union, and spurred on by fear of this pandemic,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>DC-CORE still believes the union can do more and has applied pressure internally.<\/p>\n<p>In the days <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/12\/21\/a-train-wreck-in-slow-motion-covid-cases-rise-in-some-d-c-schools-straining-teachers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading up to winter break<\/a> in December, as the omicron variant drove infections up in school buildings, teachers\u2019 worries intensified. Some educators urged D.C. Public Schools to temporarily shift to online instruction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThings were not good and chaotic,\u201d Fuchs said.<\/p>\n<p>The caucus asked Lyons to hold a virtual meeting for members to discuss possible actions the union could take. They wanted solutions in place before students and staff were expected to return to buildings after winter break in January, according to Fuchs.<\/p>\n<p>Fuchs, a social studies teacher at H.D. Woodson High School, said Lyons agreed to the meeting but that \u201cno one was really allowed to talk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chat function was turned off and members were not allowed to appear on camera, Fuchs said. A question and answer portion of the meeting was heavily moderated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much of a town hall,\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cIt was very frustrating and really surprising to me that they would try to stop people from talking to each other in this way. There was no reason for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lyons said managing the comments can be difficult during hours-long meetings with hundreds of members.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have to give us some grace,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a mighty staff but we\u2019re a very small staff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Frustrated, DC-CORE held its own meeting that Fuchs said attracted more than 400 educators. By the end of it, the caucus decided to introduce a couple of measures in the union\u2019s representative assembly, a body of teachers elected to represent their schools.<\/p>\n<p>One of the measures could have led to another \u201csick out\u201d in January, where teachers would use their personal time to stay home from work for a day.<\/p>\n<p>The representative assembly, which must approve such actions, wanted to put the measure to a vote, according to Fuchs.\u00a0But she said the union\u2019s executive board determined those actions could harm the union, quashing any potential demonstration. Fuchs, who is also on the executive board, said she abstained from that decision.<\/p>\n<p>DC-CORE has successfully pushed other measures through in the representative assembly, including a vote of no confidence in city leaders over the reopening of schools.<\/p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wtulocal6.net\/_no_confidence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resolution<\/a>, which passed in October, rebuked city officials for opening campuses without fully functional HVAC systems and failing to offer virtual teaching options, among other issues.<\/p>\n<p>The caucus currently has more than 60 members who pay annual dues. Hundreds more educators have attended its meetings, according to Fuchs.<\/p>\n<p>She said too much of the union\u2019s power is currently concentrated in the presidency and executive board, which are elected positions. Instead the caucus wants the union\u2019s members to lead its decision making, which would take organizing teachers in every campus across D.C. Public Schools.<\/p>\n<p>Doing so would also better position the union to take action during an emergency, Fuchs said. That includes being prepared to go on strike, if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to ask members: \u2018where\u2019s your line? What are you not willing to accept?,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not willing to strike, then that\u2019s fine \u2026 But if we don\u2019t have labor action on the table, we will always be on the menu, like we are all the time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2018They\u2019ll be ready to fight\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The fissures in the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union are not unique.<\/p>\n<p>Caucuses within teachers unions developed traction in the 1960s and 1970s, when teachers started winning the right to collectively bargain, according to Brad Marianno, who studies teachers unions as an assistant professor of educational policy and leadership at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe tend to see teachers unions as these monolithic organizations where all teachers kind of believe the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re like any other organizations where they have disagreements and factions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Social justice-oriented caucuses that emerged after the Great Recession forced school districts to slash budgets. That\u2019s what happened in the Chicago Teachers Union, when members of the organization\u2019s CORE caucus ascended\u00a0 to top leadership positions in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>The caucus\u2019 takeover <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2012\/09\/10\/160868924\/chicago-teachers-on-strike-affecting-400-000-students\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">culminated in a 2012 strike<\/a>, Marianno said, where thousands of Chicago teachers refused to work after the union and city leaders reached a stalemate over contract negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>Similar caucuses have emerged as forces in teachers unions across the country over the last decade, including in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Baltimore. The groups are united by progressive causes and a willingness to become more confrontational with school district leaders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve returned to some of the more aggressive labor tactics in order to make their demands heard,\u201d Marianno said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about the type of collegiality that tends to pervade education.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many of the groups meet monthly as part of the United Caucus of Rank and File Educators, an assembly of caucuses from across the country that are focused on social justice issues. The meetings are facilitated by Labor Notes, which helps labor activists organize.<\/p>\n<p>Teachers unions tend to focus on providing services to members, such as representing educators in contract negotiations and handling grievances teachers file against school districts, according to Barbara Madeloni, an organizer with Labor Notes. But that work often happens without including members, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Labor Notes also helps workers in caucuses figure out when and how to run for leadership.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe come together to support people, members who are looking to transform their unions,\u201d said Madeloni, who previously served as the president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a statewide union. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019re going to run for election in order to have leadership that can use the resources of the union to transform the union.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Membership of the United Caucus of Rank and File Educators has increased over the last two years, she added. Many teachers are galvanized by dissatisfaction over how elected leaders have managed public education during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe lack of a coherent response from the federal government, from the state governments, the insisting that schools remain open without input from educators, has created really brutal circumstances for educators,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be ready to fight in the coming years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>A fractured union<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In recent months, the chat section of monthly Zoom meetings for Washington Teachers\u2019 Union members have deteriorated into bickering and name calling, some members say.<\/p>\n<p>Detractors of DC-CORE have criticized the group for its racial composition, arguing it consists of mostly white teachers.<\/p>\n<p>Insults have been aimed at caucus members during meetings, according to Alicia Chambers, a middle school teacher in Ward 6 and another founding member of the group. She said one of its members was compared to former president Donald Trump and that the caucus has been accused of trying to \u201cgentrify\u201d the union.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest: I think we\u2019ve gotten a bad rap,\u201d said Chambers, who is Black. \u201cI think it\u2019s being mischaracterized by people who don\u2019t want change. They say they want change. But they really don\u2019t. They don\u2019t want to rock the boat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chambers said she chose to participate in DC-CORE at the start of the pandemic because she felt union leadership was trying too hard to stay in the \u201cgood graces of the powers that be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe were at a standstill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe needed to push forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, some educators are discouraged by the way DC-CORE members can overrun union meetings, talk over other members, and force \u201clopsided\u201d views, according to Maxine Jefferson, a special education teacher at H.D. Woodson High School.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe way the union looks right now, from the inside, it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe behavior, it\u2019s not professional. And it\u2019s not what we should be showing each other or our students.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jefferson also said she heard from some teachers who feel DC-CORE is not doing enough to prioritize issues that are important to Black educators. In response, she started the Black Educator Caucus of Rank and File Educators, or BECOREDC.<\/p>\n<p>She said the caucus has two key priorities: bolstering special education services and addressing IMPACT, a controversial system D.C. Public Schools uses to evaluate teachers. A recent study of IMPACT found evidence of racial bias \u2014 Black and Hispanic teachers consistently scored lower on evaluations than white educators.<\/p>\n<p>Jefferson, who is Black, said BECOREDC has more than 70 members who pay dues to the caucus.<\/p>\n<p>Gleeson Young, an instructional coach at School Without Walls at Francis Stevens, disagrees with strategies DC-CORE uses, which she feels can undermine the work of others in the union.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a team within the union is currently negotiating a new labor contract with D.C. Public Schools. Actions such as the vote of no confidence against Bowser and Ferebee can jeopardize those negotiations, Young said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the mayor. But this is the person who controls the budget, who controls the school system, so I have to respect the office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting out fires.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Young, a member of the union\u2019s executive board, emphasized she was not speaking on behalf of the board.<\/p>\n<p>She also noted that DC-CORE grew more active after the sudden death last year of Elizabeth Davis, the well-respected former president of the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union whose disputes with city leaders <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/local\/305\/2020\/10\/22\/926650171\/labor-board-ruling-may-complicate-d-c-p-s-plans-to-welcome-back-some-students\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regularly spilled into public view<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Young said she feels caucus members have not given the union enough time to regroup\u00a0under Lyons, who Young described as a more pragmatic leader.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone more or less has the same goal or opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how it\u2019s done that I think is causing a lot of problems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some members have also noted the union is expected to elect a new president and other leaders in coming months, which they say is fueling some of the conflict.<\/p>\n<p>Jefferson, of BECOREDC, said she is strongly considering running for president. DC-CORE said it will not run a slate of its members for union leadership but individuals in the caucus may choose to run.<\/p>\n<p>For her part, Lyons said she is responsible for representing the entire union, which is formed of members who have a variety of beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of the pandemic, she has had to balance the desires of teachers who disagreed about when it was safe to reopen schools.<\/p>\n<p>She has had to account for a small minority of members who do not feel the city should mandate a vaccine requirement for school staff.<\/p>\n<p>And, when it comes to a strike or sick out, she said she has to remember the union represents many women who are breadwinners and may not be able to afford to miss work because they could lose pay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have to do what\u2019s best for the union and for all of our members,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cWe have to come through unity and solidarity.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>In recent months,

Schools, Teachers And Families Are Feeling Strained","content":"<p>Coronavirus cases were rising at McKinley Technology High School, sending dozens of students into quarantine. Desks sat empty. School workers did not know where to turn.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are scared to go to work,\u201d nearly 80 staff members at the school in Eckington said in an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thebrownlawyer\/status\/1471582090366013445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open letter to city leaders<\/a> on Friday. \u201cWe are prepared to take additional measures to ensure that our voices are not only heard but understood.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>School workers threatened to \u201ctake additional action\u201d if education leaders did not respond to the letter. They ultimately did not have to act on that threat \u2013 D.C. Public Schools announced over the weekend that McKinley would temporarily close.<\/p>\n<p>The campus is one of 11 campuses the school system has shuttered in recent days because of high numbers of COVID-19 cases. Students at each of those schools will receive remote instruction through Wednesday, which is the start of their winter break.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee also announced additional measures this week aimed at curtailing the spread of the virus in the school system as cases surge across the region. The system will delay the return of students from winter break by two days in January, so schools have time to distribute rapid at-home test kits to families.<\/p>\n<p>But some parents and educators are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/chancellor-ferebee-and-mayor-bowser-dcps-needs-to-pivot-to-virtual-learning-for-all-schools-for-monday-tuesday-and-wednesday?recruiter=1693210&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=11511800-bee5-012f-fdf0-40406f61fb41&amp;share_bandit_exp=initial-31740326-en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demanding the city cancel in-person instruction<\/a> for all students until winter break, and for one or two weeks after. The pleas have reached a crescendo as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus takes hold just as people are planning to gather for the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>The rising case numbers forced nearly 3,470 students in DCPS to quarantine on Friday \u2013 the most recorded on a single day by far since the start of the academic year. It is also testing the resolve of teachers, some of whom feel increasingly unsafe at work.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Iacovone, a veteran teacher at McKinley, said he feels the school system is endangering students and staff. He said it is impossible to enforce masking requirements in buildings \u2013 some students do not wear their masks in class or in the hallways, despite repeated reminders from staff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy lunch period and planning period are me in a locked room because I have to worry about me and my family,\u201d said Iacovone, who has taught at McKinley for 17 years. \u201cBecause I know right outside that door, these kids, who I deeply care about, are not being safe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said he feels the school system has not provided enough support to help carry out the masking requirement, and other safety measures.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a breaking point,\u201d Iacovone said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this happen like a train wreck in slow motion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Iacovone was among the dozens of staff members at McKinley who signed the open letter which urged DCPS to provide remote instruction during at least the first week back from winter break. They argue a delay will give community members time to get tested or quarantine if they are exposed to the virus over the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>Educators at other campuses in the 50,000-student school system are also pushing to temporarily shift instruction online.<\/p>\n<p>At Jefferson Middle School Academy in Southwest, Latisha Nero took matters into her own hands after at least 13 cases were identified at the school in recent weeks.<\/p>\n<p>She wrote a message to city leaders that said \u201cthe spread of covid within our school building is out of control and will continue to get worse if we do not take immediate action.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nero said most of the cases at Jefferson were identified among students in the sixth grade. Fewer of her students have shown up to class over the last week because they tested positive for the virus. Others were absent because they had to quarantine after coming in close contact with a person who tested positive or because their parents chose to keep them home as a preventative measure.<\/p>\n<p>Jefferson announced Monday the entire sixth grade class would shift to virtual instruction until winter break. Nero said she believes the entire school should follow suit, and does not understand why some campuses have been allowed to move all learning online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTeachers are afraid of catching COVID right before the break, potentially spreading it to loved ones over the holiday,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also very disheartening and upsetting to see that certain schools are being closed over others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During a press conference on Monday, Ferebee said the school system may choose to close campuses if too many students and staff are unable to show up in person.<\/p>\n<p>But he said the school system is planning to keep schools open if they can, noting the vast majority of the school system\u2019s 117 campuses have experienced one case or less over the last ten days. Ferebee also pointed to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that prioritizes safe in-person instruction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhere we see cases we respond accordingly,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cBut we also know that school is the best place for students to be right now to learn and be supported.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Students at <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/12\/15\/covid-19-cases-trigger-school-closures-in-dc-prince-georges-county\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Whittier Elementary School<\/a> were the first in the school system to shift to virtual instruction last week. Officials have since <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DCPSChancellor\/status\/1473099380328701954\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced closures<\/a> at 10 other campuses, including Drew Elementary School and West Elementary School, which are scheduled to shift to virtual instruction tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Some parents and students say they are going to make their own decisions about in-person learning.<\/p>\n<p>A 16-year-old student at School Without Walls High School said she does not plan to attend school for the rest of the week because of rising cases. Twenty-nine cases have been identified at Walls since last week, according to a letter the school sent to families on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The teenager said she has had contact with multiple people who have tested positive for COVID in recent weeks, including a classmate in her band class.<\/p>\n<p>The student, who requested anonymity because she did not want to damage relationships with school administrators, said she also attended a birthday party earlier this month where two other high school students eventually tested positive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere were only 15 people there and they were all vaccinated so we all kind of assumed it was OK,\u201d the teenager said. \u201cIt all kind of came crashing back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>David Joseph, the father of a first grade student at Powell Elementary School in Petworth, said he is keeping his son home until after the new year.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph, a data analyst, has tracked coronavirus cases in D.C. Public Schools since the start of the academic year. He has watched case numbers increase since Thanksgiving, plotting the numbers on graphs and posting them to Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>He said he chose to keep his older son home for the last couple days before winter break in part to protect his three-year-old son, who is not yet eligible for a coronavirus vaccine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really scary,\u201d said Joseph, a critic of the school system\u2019s response to the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to put my entire family\u2019s health at risk over two days at school.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>D.C.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
