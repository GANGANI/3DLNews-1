Glenn Youngkin&rsquo;s administration that would restrict the rights of transgender and nonbinary students.<\/p>\n<p>Roughly 50 students at Annandale High School in Fairfax County participated in the state-wide walk out, chanting &ldquo;Trans rights are human rights&rdquo; and warning of dangers posed to young people by the policy. They also encouraged school staff to join them in protesting<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This new policy can put students in danger at home and in school settings,&rdquo; says one student who helped lead Annandale&rsquo;s protest. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re outed to their parents, their community, they can be put in danger, be kicked out, they might have suicidal ideation. And, all in all, this policy will harm everyone.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The high schoolers &ndash; many of them Black, brown or first generation immigrants &ndash; reflected on the rights they will lose if their school division accepts Youngkin&rsquo;s policy. (When the policy was announced, Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Michelle Reid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcps.edu\/node\/46306\">told families<\/a> the division would &ldquo;thoroughly review&rdquo; the proposal and emphasized that FCPS &ldquo;would remain an inclusive learning environment.&rdquo;)<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As someone who comes from an already homophobic Christian environment,&rdquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/app.trint.com\/public\/bb3600a1-4cde-4095-b1e1-ccc2e49f3f7e\">says another student<\/a>. &ldquo;I do not need to, like, feel unsafe at school.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A third student shouted: &ldquo;Our government cares more about gun rights than trans rights &mdash; and that just shows they don&rsquo;t give a fuck about their students.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The protests were organized by student-led LGBTQ advocacy group Pride Liberation Project, which <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PrideLiberation\/status\/1574774076735750145\">said<\/a> more than 1,000 students had walked out of classes across Virginia by 11 a.m. on Tuesday. More walkouts were planned for the afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>One of the Annandale organizers, Tanya Dubey, joined the cause with friends in mind. &ldquo;I have friends who are transgender and who are in households that will never support them &hellip; That&rsquo;s heartbreaking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to be there for them. I want to be able to help them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Virginia is one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.them.us\/story\/dont-say-gay-bill-anti-lgbtq-legislation-florida-idaho\">several states targeting trans youth<\/a>. The Youngkin administration <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/09\/19\/youngkin-transgender-students-virginia-schools\/\">proposal<\/a> would strike down the ability of transgender and nonbinary students in Virginia public schools to use names, pronouns, and school facilities that reflect their gender identity. It would require school staff to refer to and categorize students according to their sex assigned at birth &mdash; as reflected in their educational records &mdash; unless a parent produces a legal document requesting otherwise on behalf of their child. And it would make it mandatory for schools to report to parents before a student receives counseling services at school related to gender.<\/p>\n<p>The goal, according to the Youngkin administration, is to promote &ldquo;parental rights,&rdquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/21\/12\/07\/parents-say-nuance-is-lost-in-heated-northern-virginia-school-debates\/\">a political talking point<\/a> the governor used to great success in his election campaign in 2021, and one that has caught on among Republican politicians across the country since.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Parents must have a role in their children&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; said Youngkin last Tuesday at an election event in Loudoun County.<\/p>\n<p>But advocates &mdash; including many students &mdash; say the policy could put young people who are LGBTQ and from unsupportive homes at risk. Advocates <a href=\"https:\/\/sadbrowngirl.substack.com\/p\/we-the-abuser-state#footnote-7\">have also criticized &ldquo;parental rights&rdquo; policies more broadly<\/a> as treating children as property instead of as people.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&rsquo;d guess more than a hundred students have walked out of HB Woodlawn in Arlington in protest of a proposed state policy restricting trans rights.

They pointed to Youngkin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/08\/23\/youngkin-plans-midterm-campaign-stops-00053227\">extensive travel out-of-state<\/a> this election cycle, particularly to early presidential primary states, to campaign for fellow Republican candidates.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is only about gaining conservative voters,&rdquo; Dubey said. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with protecting parental rights or protecting anyone, for that matter of fact. It&rsquo;s another hateful way of discriminating against the LGBTQ community.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>If adopted, the model policy would be a significant about-face from the Department of Education&rsquo;s 2021 model policy &mdash; developed during the Northam administration, and mandated by legislation passed by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly at the time &mdash; which required schools to refer to students by their gender identities, and suggested that schools should prioritize student confidentiality over parent notification, especially in situations where a student&rsquo;s safety was at risk.<\/p>\n<p>Dubey said she thought the old guidelines were &ldquo;very minimal.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d like to see better enforcement of the original standards, which are supposed to protect transgender and nonbinary students from being &ldquo;deadnamed&rdquo; (called by a birth name they no longer use) or misgendered in school.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the Department of Education proposal is just that: a proposal. But, in a political moment when LGBTQ rights, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/09\/08\/1121869386\/trans-students-say-they-are-nervous-to-go-to-school-under-anti-trans-legislation\">particularly in schools<\/a>, are increasingly the centerpiece of conservative culture wars, that proposal sparked a firestorm of debate, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2022\/09\/22\/exchange-over-trans-policy-gets-angry-spanberger-good\/\">sharp words<\/a> between members of Virginia&rsquo;s congressional delegation over the causes of high rates of suicide among LGBTQ youth.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, the policy&rsquo;s 30-day public comment period <a href=\"https:\/\/townhall.virginia.gov\/L\/GDocForum.cfm?GDocForumID=1953\">opened<\/a> &mdash; and drew over 14,000 responses to the online portal, more comments in a single day than were posted in the entire month-long open process for the previous policy. A majority of the responses appeared to oppose the policy. Hundreds of comments are added each hour.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Children have bodily autonomy and should be able to use whatever toilet they choose to,&rdquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/townhall.virginia.gov\/L\/viewcomments.cfm?commentid=145857\">says one commenter,<\/a> who identifies as an Alexandria parent and opposes the Youngkin policy. &ldquo;Schools need to figure out how to stop fights and vaping, not police what bathrooms they use.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After the public comment period ends, the policy may be adopted by the Virginia Department of Education. If the policy is put in place, after that, local school boards would be expected to create and approve their own policies in compliance with the model. But if that happens, it&rsquo;s unclear whether schools will comply and whether the policy <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/09\/19\/youngkin-transgender-students-virginia-schools\/\">is legal<\/a> under Virginia code and human rights law.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/09\/19\/youngkin-transgender-students-virginia-schools\/\">Most Northern Virginia school divisions said<\/a> in response to the draft policy announcement that their current policies &mdash; meant to be inclusive of transgender and nonbinary students &mdash; are unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Students are very clearly against this, and very clearly just trying to be happy, just trying to be in class and do their homework,&rdquo; Dubey

To \u2018Racist, Marauding Mobs\u2019","content":"<p>As D.C. gears up for yet another <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/01\/06\/dc-trump-election-protest\/\">thousands-strong rally<\/a> of Trump supporters today, local officials have been clear about their strategy: They\u2019re calling for D.C.-area residents to stay away from the demonstrations, and police say they will try to keep protesters and counterprotesters separated.<\/p>\n<p>While officials maintain this is the best way to keep everyone safe, critics contend that the District is ceding its downtown to extremists intent on causing harm to local people and property.<\/p>\n<p>President Trump tweeted that he\u2019ll be speaking during Wednesday morning\u2019s events at the Ellipse, and his supporters began gathering downtown on Tuesday. By 10 p.m., police had already made <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/01\/05\/arrests-pro-trump-maga-rally-dc\/\">six arrests<\/a> related to the demonstrations with multiple weapons charges. More arrests were made later in the evening as pro-Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/wjla.com\/news\/local\/watch-tensions-rise-near-black-lives-matter-plaza-after-day-of-pro-trump-protests\">crowds clashed with officers<\/a> during a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bgonthescene\/status\/1346658756285894661?s=21\">heated confrontation<\/a> near Black Lives Matter Plaza.<\/p>\n<p>The Proud Boys \u2014 a group with a history of violence and white nationalist ties, and classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group \u2014 are among the multiple pro-Trump groups that are <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/01\/04\/pro-trump-rallies-what-we-know\/\">gathering in D.C. this week<\/a>. Posts in fringe social media chats and message boards indicate that the Proud Boys intend to create chaos, as they did at rallies in November and December.<\/p>\n<p>November\u2019s rally turned from chants of \u201cstop the steal\u201d to <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/14\/dc-maga-protesters-rally-for-trump-downtown\/\">outbreaks of violence in the evening<\/a>, and the Proud Boys marched through the city <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Marissa_Jae\/status\/1327784795368271873\">claiming the streets<\/a> as their own. The night ended with 21 arrests, a man <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/14\/stabbing-maga-protest-downtown-dc\/\">stabbed<\/a>, and a lot of questions about the free-for-all chaos that erupted in the District.<\/p>\n<p>The subsequent MAGA rally quickly descended into fights, arrests, and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/12\/12\/four-people-stabbed-dc-protests-maga-rally\/\">stabbings<\/a>. Proud Boys <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/12\/13\/proud-boys-dc-church-black-lives-matter-banner-burned\/\">burned Black Lives Matter banners<\/a> belonging to local Black churches, an action that drew condemnation from Mayor Muriel Bowser. (A group of local black churches <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcwashington.com\/news\/local\/churches-call-for-extra-security-ahead-of-protests-after-blm-signs-destroyed\/2526748\/\">is calling for a police detail<\/a> to protect Asbury Methodist Church, where one of the banners was burned.)<\/p>\n<p>D.C. police <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/01\/04\/proud-boys-leader-arrested-blm-banner-burning\/\">arrested Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio<\/a> on Monday in connection with the destruction of one of these banners, also charging him for two high-capacity firearm magazines they found in his backpack. On Tuesday afternoon, a judge banned Tarrio from D.C. until his next court date, in June. Tarrio <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/12\/18\/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-black-lives-matter-church-protests\/\">claimed responsibility<\/a> for burning the banner in interviews with media outlets and the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.<\/p>\n<p>But police did not intervene to prevent the vandalism while it happened. While officers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/trump-dc-rally-maga\/2020\/12\/11\/8b5af818-3bdb-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html\">scrambled to break up fights<\/a> and block off roaming groups, some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2020\/12\/15\/punched-kicked-stomped-three-stories-from-saturdays-protrump-rally-in-dc-violence\/\">witnesses<\/a> said officers did little to intervene when Proud Boys targeted bystanders away from the main streets downtown.<\/p>\n<p>The police department\u2019s relatively lenient handling of the right-wing protest stood in contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/30\/dc-protests-after-march-on-washington-police-tactics\/\">racial<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/14\/black-lives-matter-blm-protest-kettle-adams-morgan-dc-arrest\/\">justice<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/08\/mpd-lafayette-square-tear-gas-june-1-trump-lawsuit\/\">rallies<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/23\/demonstrators-take-to-downtown-d-c-after-night-of-tense-clashes-with-police\/\">over<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/05\/30\/dc-protests-night-1-lafayette-park-secret-service-arrests\/\">the summer<\/a>, in which demonstrators were largely peaceful, yet police responded with significant use of force. Over the summer, MPD used military tactics including\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/02\/dupont-dc-home-protest-rahul-dubey\/\">kettling<\/a> and arresting<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/01\/dc-us-attorney-michael-sherwin-refutes-bowser-claim-office-prosecute-protesters\/\"> protestors by the dozens<\/a> \u2014 tactics not seen at the recent rallies, even as many MAGA demonstrators violate D.C.\u2019s mask mandate.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about November\u2019s pro-Trump event, outgoing D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham expressed pride in how local law enforcement agencies handled the march and subsequent conflicts: \u201cI was very impressed with the way that the Metropolitan Police Department was able to prevent more conflicts \u2026 It was actually quite remarkable. Not sure another agency in the country could\u2019ve handled that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Newsham said that MPD\u2019s decision not to intervene when pro-Trump protestors tore down artwork at Black Lives Matter Plaza was a judgement call for the nearby commanding officer at the scene. He added that MPD \u201cdid outstanding work\u201d to ensure the city\u2019s residents remained safe.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone agrees with Newsham\u2019s assessment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe violence is there, and it is very clear, and when we\u2019re out there, we see it face to face,\u201d says Bethelehem Yirga, co-creator of the D.C. activist group the <a href=\"https:\/\/palmcollective.org\/\">Palm Collective<\/a>, who was present for the two previous MAGA rallies. She says much of the violence has been based around the Lafayette Square fence, which has been a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/07\/the-new-white-house-fence-is-getting-covered-in-protest-art\/\">de facto memorial<\/a> for Black lives since the summer.<\/p>\n<p>She saw some improvements in police\u2019s handling of the December rallies: Yirga says police sectioned off and guarded the fence at the second event, which helped stave off some of the violence \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough to deter the most provocative protestors.<\/p>\n<p>For the Proud Boys, the chaos is the point, according to Cassie Miller, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center. Since the group\u2019s founding in 2016, Proud Boys have been purposefully violent, picking fights with counterprotesters and then sharing videos after the fact to increase their followers, Miller says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey go into what are generally considered pretty progressive cities in an attempt to create violent confrontations with people like antifascist and Black Lives Matter activists in order to kind of perpetuate this narrative that the left is violent, and that it represents some sort of existential threat to the nation, and that the Proud Boys are the ones who are standing kind of in between order and chaos,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>As more becomes known about the Proud Boys\u2019 tactics, faith leaders and activists have criticized Bowser, saying that she\u2019s urging locals to stay away from the downtown area, while allowing drunken mobs to roam the city looking for trouble. (A slew of regional leaders, including Montgomery County executive <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MontCoExec\/status\/1346452792945373184\">Marc Elrich<\/a>, have joined the call for locals to stay home.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThough we understand the mayor\u2019s concern for the residents of the city, it is galling to simply surrender our city to racist marauding mobs,\u201d wrote Rev. Graylan Scott Hagler, of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ in Northeast D.C., in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AndrewGiambrone\/status\/1346236384311390209\/photo\/1\">statement<\/a> with local clergy. \u201cGiven previous actions by pro-Trump forces the MPD should have been prepared to handle the mob in an efficient and anticipatory way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But what exactly can MPD and the mayor do differently?<\/p>\n<p>The nation\u2019s capital, with its hefty list of law enforcement agencies, history of peaceful marches, and strict gun laws, is known for being uniquely capable of managing protests. The sites where the Trump supporters plan to march is federal land, so it\u2019s technically not up to D.C. to approve or deny permit applications \u2014 that\u2019s the National Park Service\u2019s job. Still, the recent rallies bring into question how the city handles large-scale demonstrations, especially when they feature extremists and clashes between opposing protestors.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser, whose office declined to answer emailed questions from DCist, issued a statement saying that D.C. police and the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency are coordinating with federal agencies to protect local residents and businesses during the demonstrations. The <a href=\"https:\/\/mayor.dc.gov\/release\/mayor-bowser-continues-preparation-upcoming-first-amendment-demonstrations\">statement<\/a> warned demonstrators that D.C. law prevents the open carrying of firearms. <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/14\/dc-maga-protesters-rally-for-trump-downtown\/\">At least four arrests<\/a> at the November Trump rally were for weapons violations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am asking Washingtonians and those who live in the region to stay out of the downtown area on Tuesday and Wednesday and not to engage with demonstrators who come to our city seeking confrontation,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWe will do what we must to ensure all who attend remain peaceful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether she would consider <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/01\/dc-curfew-bowser-expects-more-protests\/\">imposing a curfew<\/a> for this week\u2019s protests, as she did during multiple protests this summer, Bowser said during a press briefing, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a tool we will evaluate during the week.\u201d As of Wednesday morning, a curfew is not in place.<\/p>\n<p>One major focus of law enforcement has been to keep MAGA protesters and counterprotesters apart from one another.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine says MPD has been \u201cproperly focused on separating folks from that confrontation.\u201d He mentioned the violence in Charlottesville during a white nationalist rally in 2017, which turned fatal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/2017\/12\/01\/flawed-law-enforcement-plan-failed-prevent-injury-death-violent-charlottesville-protests\/912671001\/\">Reviews afterwards<\/a> found that law enforcement\u2019s failure to separate clashing groups was a major cause of the injury and death that day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs crazy as that sounds, white supremacists are coming into the District of Columbia in order to create chaos,\u201d Racine told DCist\/WAMU last month. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is figure out a way consistent with the First Amendment to restrict the time and place and manner of protest and make sure that the Proud Boys, when they disperse, do not have further opportunities to deface iconic properties in the District of Columbia. I do think we will have learned from what occurred just a couple weeks ago,\u201d referring to the December MAGA demonstrations.<\/p>\n<p>But keeping the groups separated comes with its own complications.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen there are protests and counterprotests going on, what we\u2019ve noticed is the police only face us, the counter protesters,\u201d Yirga of The Palm Collective says. \u201cTheir backs are to the Proud Boys and the MAGAs and they are only facing us, and it kind of looks like [it\u2019s] in a sense of solidarity [with the Trump supporters] \u2026 If they are showcasing that they\u2019re seeing the threat from the Proud Boys as well, they would actually do a two-faced line. They would do a line facing the protesters and a line facing the counterprotesters.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lining up officers to separate protesters invites critiques like that, according to Chris Burbank, former chief of the Salt Lake City Police Department and a current vice president at the <a href=\"https:\/\/policingequity.org\/about\/executive-team\/chris-burbank\">Center for Policing Equity<\/a>. He says that tactic \u201cjust invites the focus on the cops. I think what\u2019s best is the cops in and amongst the crowd, because then you can more effectively deal with those [violent] individuals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>MPD declined a request for an interview about its recent tactics or the department\u2019s plans for handling upcoming MAGA marches.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of individuals\u2019 political affiliations, it is the duty of MPD members to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, visitors and demonstrators who come to exercise their First Amendment rights,\u201d MPD spokesperson Kristen Metzger said in an emailed statement.<\/p>\n<p>Newly appointed acting D.C. police chief <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/12\/22\/robert-j-contee-washington-dc-police-replace-chief-peter-newsham\/\">Robert Contee<\/a> said Monday that MPD would increase its presence downtown this week and would even consider closing off Black Lives Matter Plaza if necessary to prevent violence. \u201cIt could be very much a game-day assessment,\u201d he told reporters.<\/p>\n<p>Contee repeatedly warned that firearms will not be tolerated, adding that Bowser\u2019s office had requested the D.C. National Guard\u2019s assistance. About 300 troops <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomsherwood\/status\/1346167847668559874\">will be activated<\/a>, with just 100 non-armed troops on duty at a time, to help MPD \u201cfocus on anyone who\u2019s intent on instigating, agitating, or participating in violence in our city,\u201d Contee said.<\/p>\n<p>Some locals argue that MPD treats protestors differently depending on how the protestors treat MPD. Proud Boys, for example, have been seen taking photos with D.C. police and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/02\/07\/officers-who-fist-bumped-proud-boy-on-july-4-didnt-violate-policy-d-c-police-determine\/\">fist-bumping<\/a> them, while Black Lives Matter D.C. openly supports the defunding of the department. Protestors and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Janeese4DC\/status\/1337977168211701765\">city officials<\/a> alike have criticized the disparate treatment of the different protestors, saying that BLM protestors get arrested for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChuckModi1\/status\/1339651592182784003\">Proud Boys-provoked violence<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>MPD denies any preferential treatment. A spokesperson for the department told DCist in an email that officers are \u201crequired to be neutral in enforcing the law, however they are allowed to engage with members of the public in a variety of circumstances, such as taking photos with residents and visitors that come to the District of Columbia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Proud Boys\u2019 posture towards local police appears to be changing. Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, said he usually gives police a heads up about the movements of the group \u2014 but during the group\u2019s last gathering in D.C. in December, he decided against it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re somewhere, I try to tell them, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re here, blah, blah, we\u2019re moving there,\u2019\u201d he said on a recent podcast livestream. \u201cAnd I think I had less of that interaction this time because I just don\u2019t trust them to do their job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The group reportedly plans to use <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/12\/29\/hotel-harrington-harrys-proud-boys-close-maga-rally\/\">new tactics<\/a> this week: \u201cWe will be incognito and we will spread across downtown DC in smaller teams. And who knows\u2026.we might dress in all BLACK for the occasion,\u201d Tarrio wrote on Parler, a social media site popular among Trump supporters, conspiracy theorists, and far-right extremists.<\/p>\n<p>Yirga, of the Palm Collective, says her group doesn\u2019t have a specific counterprotest planned for today, but is working on ways people can take action remotely, like putting up signs in windows downtown.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be quiet,\u201d she says, because when people are silent in the face of fascists, \u201cthey feel as though they\u2019re emboldened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, says the D.C. community and law enforcement officials should expect more Proud Boys demonstrations beyond the planned rally this week \u2014 at least as long as false narratives over the results of the 2020 presidential election continue to swirl.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLike any other group like this, they\u2019re really political opportunists. And so what they want to do is insert themselves into this narrative,\u201d Miller says. \u201cAnd so that means D.C. is their focus and it is likely going to remain their focus for the foreseeable future.\u201d<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning

This marks the third time Harry\u2019s has landed in news reports in recent months over\u00a0its connection to Trump supporters, large crowds gathered there, and more.<\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration slapped\u00a0the bar with <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/16\/dc-bar-covid-fines-trump-rally\/\">$2,000 in fines<\/a> for failing to comply with the city\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions in November, after scores of pro-Trump guests dined there maskless last month on a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/14\/dc-maga-protesters-rally-for-trump-downtown\/\">day of protests<\/a> in support of the president. And in October, a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/10\/07\/dc-investigating-harrys-bar-viral-police-pandemic-video\/\">video went viral<\/a>\u00a0showing maskless patrons \u2014 who were drinking nearly shoulder to shoulder\u00a0\u2014 chanting \u201cback the blue\u201d as four Metropolitan Police Department officers walked through the packed bar. That video even got a retweet from Trump himself.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the deal with Harry\u2019s? The bar, which\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/harryssaloon.com\/?fbclid=IwAR1fC0YSou6j6RH5ioQtRIUDe585M_L3UvI8c1tHfPfrN5rqqbivauyMaPQ\">opened in 1994<\/a>\u00a0and leases its space from the historic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hotel-harrington.com\/history\">Hotel Harrington<\/a>,\u00a0has become a go-to spot for pro-Trump groups in recent years, in part because of its less pricey drinks and close proximity to the Trump International Hotel, another popular, though more expensive, watering hole for the president\u2019s supporters.<\/p>\n<p>Republican political consultant and commentator\u00a0Harlan Hill told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2020\/01\/27\/where-will-the-presidents-supporters-hang-out-if-the-trump-hotels-lease-is-sold\/\">Washingtonian<\/a> in January, \u201cFor us, it\u2019s more of an after-hours place. After the Trump closes, we\u2019ll typically end up there if we\u2019re going to have a late night.

We don\u2019t discriminate against anybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Boyle declined to comment more specifically on what he thinks has made Harry\u2019s popular among Trump supporters. He says he decided to close the bar early ahead of the demonstrations this weekend, due concerns about coronavirus, large crowds, and possible violence. He says Harry\u2019s closed after lunch on both Friday and Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>Mayor Muriel Bowser said during a press briefing on Monday that the bar\u2019s early closure was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/barredindc\/status\/1338561114251128838\">part of discussions<\/a> the city had with Harry\u2019s prior to the demonstrations. Boyle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the city\u2019s involvement in the decision.<\/p>\n<p>Boyle says the now-infamous crowds gathering outside Harry\u2019s have made it challenging to comply with some city guidelines, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/abra.dc.gov\/page\/phase-two-reopen-dc\">reservation system<\/a> ABC licensees are required to implement to \u201cmitigate concentrated crowding,\u201d though he clarifies that he\u2019s not complaining about the rule.<\/p>\n<p>He says that, in November, Harry\u2019s was in complete compliance with regulations indoors, but that the bar\u2019s sidewalk cafe area was difficult to monitor, as people could step over the velvet ropes that served as a barrier. Boyle has since ordered four-foot-tall vinyl panels to replace the ropes, both to better safeguard the area and to help keep heat in as the weather gets cold.<\/p>\n<p>Case reports obtained by DCist from ABRA\u2019s November visits to Harry\u2019s, however, show that investigators noted violations both inside and outside the establishment.<\/p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s has racked up\u00a0<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/abra.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/dc\/sites\/abra\/page_content\/attachments\/2020-12-8%20Violations%20Phase%202.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/abra.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/dc\/sites\/abra\/page_content\/attachments\/2020-12-8%20Violations%20Phase%202.pdf\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-nguardprocessed=\"true\">Phase 2 violations<\/a> on a total of five separate occasions,\u00a0according to data from ABRA, including the two that resulted in citations in November.\u00a0ABRA has also issued Harry\u2019s warnings for\u00a0failing to keep tables sufficiently distanced and patrons wearing masks, among other issues. The earliest of those violations is from July, when the bar got a verbal warning for insufficient table spacing.<\/p>\n<p>Boyle says Harry\u2019s has \u201calways enforced the regulations,\u201d but wasn\u2019t able to get into specific tactics for the instances that garnered scrutiny this fall. A representative for the Hotel Harrington did not immediately respond to DCist\u2019s questions about the recent COVID-19 restriction violations at Harry\u2019s, or its popularity with Trump supporters.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the rallies this weekend,\u00a0Hotel Harrington\u2019s managing director Ann Terry told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2020\/12\/13\/what-is-the-deal-with-harrys-bar\/\">Washingtonian<\/a> that the hotel has stayed in its lane when it comes to the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t keep up with it a lot. We don\u2019t play any part in running things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She told the outlet that its potential impact on the hotel\u2019s reputation is \u201cnot something we can control, really.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Raman Santra, a lawyer who runs the bar and nightlife blog Barred in D.C., says prior to Trump taking office, Harry\u2019s was known as a \u201clower key tourist\/downtown office worker hybrid.\u201d He says workers in the service industry and others with late-night jobs have gone there, as many other close-by bars aren\u2019t open late, as have police officers.<\/p>\n<p>He says he\u2019s not surprised by its transformation into a Trump supporter hangout, given that it\u2019s a block and a half away from the Trump International Hotel, but says it\u2019s an outlier among D.C. bars, many of which are very upfront about their support for Democratic politicians on social media.<\/p>\n<p>But given the possibility of Trump launching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/12\/14\/trump-2024-possible-run-444460\">2024 presidential run<\/a>, and the continued presence of the hotel bearing his name nearby, Santra says, \u201cI think conservatives, right wing people probably will be drawn there and will still go to Harry\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All

As of Sunday afternoon,\u00a0D.C. Police had arrested at least 33 people in connection with other incidents related to Saturday\u2019s demonstrations. A 29-year-old man was arrested Saturday for a stabbing outside Harry\u2019s Bar, a popular spot for Trump supporters. It was the second time since the election that Trump supporters have gathered in Washington, leading to violence and numerous arrests.<\/p>\n<p>In a Sunday afternoon press conference, Black Lives Matter D.C. criticized the D.C. police and demanded they be held accountable for \u201cenabling white supremacist violence\u201d in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Lorenzo Green, a core organizer with the the D.C.

Explores The Impact Of Go-Go Music On Protests Against Gentrification","content":"<p>Samuel George, a 36-year-old filmmaker who\u2019s originally from Philadelphia, has an unlikely connection to go-go music.<\/p>\n<p>He says it all started back in 2013 with Gregory \u201cSugar Bear\u201d Elliot, the lead man of Experience Unlimited, famous for the immortal hit \u201cDa Butt.\u201d George, who\u2019d only been in the District for a few years, discovered that the go-go legend played every Wednesday night at The Meeting Place, a small basement bar near Farragut Square.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just started going and bringing different people,\u201d says George. \u201cEvery week, I would show up, and finally, Sugar Bear came over and said, \u2018Hey, buddy, who are you?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>George mentioned that he played guitar, typically in rock bands, and Sugar Bear soon invited him to play with the band for a song or two during one of their sets. Through Sugar Bear, he met other go-go artists and learned the ins and outs of the culture behind D.C.\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/02\/19\/its-about-to-be-official-go-go-is-d-c-s-music\/\">official music<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo the first time I ever played in a go-go band, it was with these incredible go-go musicians, and I don\u2019t think many people get a shot at that,\u201d George says. \u201cIt sounds silly to say,\u00a0but [go-go] was the thing that helped me really feel like I belonged in D.C., that D.C. wasn\u2019t just this transient place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chuck Brown is the Godfather of go-go, of course, but there are others who belong in what George calls the \u201cMount Rushmore of go-go:\u201d EU\u2019s Sugar Bear; Trouble Funk\u2019s Big Tony; Backyard Band\u2019s Anwan \u201cBig G\u201d Glover; conga player Ricky \u201cRocksteady\u201d Brown; and Sweet Cherie of Bela Dona.<\/p>\n<p>All of these foundational artists are featured in George\u2019s new documentary,\u00a0<em>Go-Go City: Displacement &amp; Protest in Washington, DC<\/em>, which <a href=\"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/webinar\/register\/WN_kAzchym6SUKnLwHJozR6Sw\">premieres virtually<\/a> Wednesday at 7 p.m.\u00a0The screening will be followed by a panel discussion with local activists, scholars, and musicians who appear in the film.\u00a0George shot and directed the 50-minute film for the Bertelsmann Foundation (the U.S. arm of the nonpartisan German think tank Bertelsmann Stiftung, which focuses on global issues), where he\u2019s an analyst and filmmaker. Arlington-based freelancer Jeff Cook served as editor.<\/p>\n<p>The film documents the intersection of go-go and the protests over\u00a0racial justice that have proliferated across the city for the better part of 2020. But it didn\u2019t start out that way.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, George set out to make a film about locals who have advocated for go-go culture amid D.C.\u2019s rampant gentrification. That was in January, before the pandemic started, before George Floyd\u2019s murder gripped the world, and before months of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/topic\/2020-blm-protests\/\">Black Lives Matter protests<\/a> ricocheted across the Washington region.<\/p>\n<p>George paused production as COVID-19 cases climbed, but when he witnessed the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/26\/dc-local-musicians-activism-blm-plaza-chants-gogo-hip-hop-protests\/\">Long Live GoGo float showing up<\/a> to just about every demonstration this summer, he decided to continue filming \u2014 with a greater focus on the current moment.<\/p>\n<p>Displacement is still a primary focus of the film, which documents the final days of the famous H Street fried fish joint <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/02\/12\/horace-and-dickies-owner-says-gentrification-is-pushing-out-his-fried-fish-carryout-after-30-years-on-h-street\/\">Horace &amp; Dickies<\/a>\u00a0and last year\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/05\/09\/the-go-go-may-be-back-at-metro-pcs-but-the-music-is-part-of-a-new-age-of-rebellion\/\">Don\u2019t Mute DC rallies<\/a>, and interweaves archival footage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/10\/upshot\/riots-redevelopment-gentrification.html\">1968 riots<\/a> that followed Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination. One particularly striking scene shows burning buildings during the 1968 riots spliced with current footage of those same streets lined with luxury apartments and young professionals exercising and walking their dogs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey call it gentrification. I call it cultural genocide,\u201d Richard \u201cDickie\u201d Shannon, of Horace &amp; Dickie\u2019s, says in the film.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GoGo City follows along as DC&#39;s beloved GoGo music becomes a catalyst for protest.

We\u2019re always looking for a home,\u201d says author and scholar Natalie Hopkinson in one of the documentary\u2019s final scenes. \u201cOne of the places is in our music and in our culture and in our rituals. So, whatever else might be happening, you\u2019re home in that moment. You\u2019re right where you should be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The irony isn\u2019t lost on George \u2014 that he\u2019s a young white man and relative newcomer to the District who\u2019s interviewing Black, native Washingtonians about gentrification. But George says he\u2019s often been an outsider highlighting communities that want their stories told. His <a href=\"https:\/\/samuelgeorge-films.org\/portfolio-2\/\">previous work<\/a> has focused on conflicts and social change in Latin America, India, and Turkey, as well as political and racial tensions in Florida and West Virginia. With the travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, George says this was a perfect opportunity to provide a platform for storytelling where he lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople want their story told the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to tell the story honestly and so important to be clear about what you\u2019re trying to do. And in my case, what I try to be clear about, and what I try to do with the film is not say, \u2018I\u2019m telling a story.\u2019 Rather, I\u2019m trying to give people the space to tell their story, and I try to be a conduit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After Wednesday\u2019s screening, DC Shorts International Film Festival will co-host a panel discussion featuring go-go artist Rocksteady; protestor Terrence Odom; anthropologist Sabiyha Prince; DC Shorts Executive Director Peter Morgan; and At-Large D.C. Councilmember Robert White. The documentary itself won\u2019t live online just yet, but George says there will likely be a few more public screenings over the next few months.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, George wants D.C. residents, new and old, to gain a unique perspective on the city\u2019s cascade of social and economic changes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn the one hand, I hope that the people in the communities that are in the film see themselves in it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also hope some of the young people, and the gentrifiers, and people that, like me, moved in within the last 10 years, can see this and start to see a Washington that they might not have realized [existed].\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/webinar\/register\/WN_kAzchym6SUKnLwHJozR6Sw\">Go-Go City: Displacement &amp; Protest in Washington, DC<\/a><em> premieres virtually at 7 p.m. Wednesday.

(A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/trump-dc-protests\/2020\/11\/13\/b5961e8c-25ec-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html\"> similar scene<\/a> had played out on Friday afternoon, when a crowd of pro-Trump demonstrators filled the plaza and ripped down the protest artwork that plastered the fence around the White House.)<\/p>\n<p>While the rally didn\u2019t draw the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ddale8\/status\/1327668601827037184\">million people<\/a> of its namesake, both local supporters and pro-Trump allies from across the country poured into the city. Maryland Grassroots Republicans planned a trip into the city, as did the Virginia Asian Pacific Americans for Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Others came from much farther away.<\/p>\n<p>Luis Huerta said he drove without stopping from Midland-Odessa, Texas, with his family for the rallies. He said Trump has protected freedom of speech and religion during his presidency, values he feels the country is losing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time our voices were heard and about time we stop giving ground,\u201d Huerta said as he held a \u201cTexans for Trump\u201d sign. \u201cThis country was founded on certain principles and it\u2019s about time we uphold those principles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Huerta said he believed the country was thriving under Trump until the coronavirus pandemic and that the president has done an \u201cawesome\u201d job navigating the country through the public health crisis. On Friday, the U.S. recorded a record high of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/us\/coronavirus-us-cases.html\">more than 180,000 new COVID-19 cases,<\/a> as experts warned that the country <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2020\/11\/09\/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us\/\">could be entering its worst phase<\/a> of the pandemic yet.<\/p>\n<p>Rob Cortis, a business consultant from Detroit, said he believed there was widespread election fraud in the presidential election and that conservative voices are being censored on social media and in public life. A report released last year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2019\/08\/20\/facebook-makes-small-tweaks-following-anti-conservative-bias-report-theyre-unlikely-make-issue-go-away\/\">by a former GOP senator and law firm<\/a> did not suggest any evidence of anti-conservative bias. And right-leaning media outlets and Republican supporters dominated online forums around the most notable issues leading up to this year\u2019s election, according to a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/10\/26\/censorship-conservatives-social-media-432643\"> Politico analysis<\/a> of millions of social media posts, conservative social media accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Social media companies had taken steps to quell the spread of voting misinformation, which may have also impacted the planning of Saturday\u2019s rally and others across the country. Facebook and Evenbrite took down event pages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/11\/6\/21552752\/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump\">promoting \u201cStop the Steal\u201d content<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/airbnb\/status\/1326635508177408000?s=21\">AirBnB said it cancelled a booking<\/a> for an alleged white nationalist who had planned to attend D.C.\u2019s rally.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere on Saturday, a small group of<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Evan_Yeats\/status\/1327627977413308417\"> school nurses protesting the city\u2019s reopening plan<\/a> in Ward 4 were met with police officers and threats of arrest, according to Ward 4 ANC Commissioner Evan Yeats.<\/p>\n<p>While the largest crowds dissipated by early evening, numerous groups of Trump supporters and counter-demonstrators remained on the scene, which has grown increasingly chaotic.<\/p>\n<p>A number of places downtown&#8212;including<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ABC7News\/status\/1327751206970777601\"> Black Lives Matter Plaza<\/a>, the area outside the Capital Hilton, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/justinwmmoyer\/status\/1327781821795463170\">K Street<\/a>&#8212;have been the site of repeated confrontations. Police have used a variety of tactics to keep the groups separate, with videos showing officers pushing <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ABC7News\/status\/1327751206970777601\">protesters back with bicycles<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mattmiller757\/status\/1327750800148467713\">deploying chemical irritants<\/a>, and clearing the streets.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, a large group of counterprotesters yelled at diners, one of whom was wearing a Make America Great Again sweatshirt, eating outside of P.J. Clarke\u2019s before a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ABC7News\/status\/1327762983288795137\">firecracker was set off<\/a> in their direction, as captured by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shomaristone\/status\/1327760297151651841\">NBC Washington&#8217;s Shomari Stone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And in a reprisal of the morning&#8217;s events, a group of Proud Boys once again marched through the streets of downtown.

The Trump administration has banned nearly all travelers or immigrants from five majority-Muslim countries, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Somalia, in addition to North Korea and Venezuela. Critics of the ban have pointed to Trump\u2019s many negative remarks about Islam as proof of bias.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are here to tell Biden, \u2018sir, we are so happy that you are here,\u2019\u201d

Police say Hylton-Brown rode a moped out of an alley and struck a passenger vehicle. Witnesses say they saw police chase Hylton-Brown and said his death was an extension of a pattern of police harassment of young Black men in the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>The protest began in the early evening, when Hylton-Brown\u2019s mother stood outside the precinct building, asking to speak to officers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlease come out and talk,\u201d she spoke into a megaphone. \u201cTell me something.

Councilmembers\u2019 Homes Spark Backlash \u2014 Here\u2019s Why","content":"<p>A protest outside of At-Large Councilmember Anita Bonds\u2019 house the other week has led to a counterprotest, a debate about demonstration tactics, and an opportunity for some candidates in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/10\/05\/dc-council-at-large-race-23-candidates-voter-guide\/\">crowded at-large race<\/a> to sling shots at one another. If you missed the videos and the dueling statements, we\u2019re here to help with an explainer about this kerfuffle, and some background on \u201chome visits\u201d in the city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happened at Bonds\u2019 house on October 9?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Around 11 p.m. on that Friday, members of Sunrise Movement DC gathered outside of Bonds\u2019 house with a message about housing reform and rent control. Sunrise Movement is a national environmental advocacy organization with a series of local hubs, including a District-based chapter, which is part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/11\/14\/tenant-advocates-are-pushing-for-sweeping-updates-to-rent-control-in-d-c\/\">Reclaim Rent Control coalition<\/a>\u00a0calling for <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/10\/04\/with-d-c-s-rent-control-law-up-for-renewal-housing-advocates-want-to-make-it-stronger\/\">sweeping changes<\/a> to the city\u2019s protections for tenants. Their asks include expanding rent control to more tenants and limiting how much landlords can raise rent annually. Bonds, a Democrat, serves as the chair of the D.C. Council\u2019s housing committee, and has control over which bills get public hearings and come to a vote on the five-person committee.<\/p>\n<p>Sunrise Movement DC organizer Aura Ang\u00e9lica says the group specifically chose that day to protest outside of Bonds\u2019 house to call her out for what they deemed a broken promise from the councilmember: She pledged after a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/25\/dc-landlords-and-tenants-poke-holes-in-proposals-to-tweak-rent-control\/\">September housing committee hearing<\/a>\u00a0that a bill mirroring the <a href=\"http:\/\/reclaimrentcontrol.org\/our-platform\/\">coalition\u2019s demands<\/a> would get a hearing in early November. But when the schedule of forthcoming council hearings came out on October 9, they didn\u2019t see that hearing on the list. The activists, who numbered more than a dozen, knocked on Bonds\u2019 door around 11 p.m. When she declined to come outside to speak with them, they proceeded to protest for about an hour outside her house with signs and chants through a bullhorn calling for comprehensive rent control legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Bonds, who is Black, told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wusa9.com\/article\/news\/local\/dc\/dc-councilmember-anita-bonds-says-protestors-crossed-the-line\/65-e0b0c0d7-7e00-4844-8535-87e92f2cefd6\">WUSA 9<\/a> that \u201cthese are the same tactics the KKK used against Black people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marcus Goodwin, a candidate in the at-large race who <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SunriseMvmtDC\/status\/1314384279519072257\">Sunrise criticized for his job<\/a> as a developer and campaign donations from the business community, said in a statement that the protesters \u201charassed [Bonds] through a megaphone, vandalized the Marcus Goodwin campaign sign in her front yard, and dumped stolen Marcus Goodwin campaign signs on her property. This is not the Washington, D.C. that anyone wants to live in \u2014 where an African American woman, inside her own home, is terrorized at midnight by a group of radicals.\u201d Goodwin is also Black.<\/p>\n<p>(Bonds has not officially endorsed Goodwin, though she has spoken favorably about his campaign. He unsuccessfully challenged her in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/06\/19\/election-results\/\">2018 Democratic primary.<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Sunrise Movement DC responded in a statement that it \u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unequivocally condemns these characterizations, and emphasizes that CM Bonds and Goodwin have used them to distract from the violence of gentrification in D.C. and their lack of action during a pandemic that has disproportionately affected Black and brown D.C. residents.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Is this a new protest tactic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, protesters have <a href=\"https:\/\/thekojonnamdishow.org\/2018\/06\/28\/x-times-protesters-crashed-politicians-home-turf\">long held demonstrations<\/a> outside the homes of both public officials and private citizens, though the tactic certainly seems to have gotten more attention during the Trump administration. Back in 1970, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/06\/27\/watergate-protest-administration-officials\/\">hundreds of demonstrators went to the Watergate<\/a>\u00a0to protest a court verdict, choosing the home of a slate of Nixon officials and Republican legislators because the complex \u201csymbolizes the ruling class.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And while <a href=\"http:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/06\/22\/protesters-played-sounds-of-crying\/\">federal<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/06\/26\/stephen-miller-protest\/\">government<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/08\/15\/protesters-gather-outside-of-postmaster-generals-d-c-home-as-threats-to-mail-in-voting-loom\/\">officials<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/17\/03\/31\/queer-dance-partiers-bringing-glitt\/\">are<\/a> often the target of so-called \u201chome visits,\u201d it\u2019s also a tactic used on the local level. Ed Lazere, another candidate for the open at-large seat (more on that in a moment), recalls going to a protest two dozen years ago outside of then-Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans\u2019 house to call for a better affordable housing bill. \u201cWe got [Evans] to say \u2018yes\u2019 in front of his house,\u201d says Lazere. Housing advocates have also held protests outside of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/15\/12\/18\/activists-take-complaints-about-con\/\">developers\u2019 homes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Just as home visits are not new, neither is the controversy around them. Critics contend that the tactic is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2018\/06\/incivility-vietnam-protests\/563837\/\">uncivil<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/18\/11\/08\/after-protest-at-tucker-carlsons-house-group-says-fascists-are-vulnerable-confront-them-at-their-homes\/\">threatening<\/a>. Sometimes the targets of the protests use them to garner sympathy or, in the case of a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/21\/no-confirmation-before-inauguration\/\">recent early morning Sunrise protest at Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s house<\/a>, to fundraise.<\/p>\n<p>Protesters, meanwhile, often say that disruption is part of effective advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>The issue has come up before the D.C. Council, which passed the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/10\/11\/29\/masked-protestor-bill-passes-counci\/\">Residential Tranquility Act in 2010.<\/a>\u00a0The legislation further limited protesters\u2019 ability to demonstrate outside of homes at night, in response to an animal rights group\u2019s protests. (Bonds told WUSA 9 that she almost called the cops on the Sunrise protesters because they were breaking the law by protesting outside her house at night. Ang\u00e9lica, meanwhile, says that police were on the scene and did not intervene.)<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t even a new tactic for Bonds, who was among many D.C. councilmembers whose homes saw protests over the summer. Many of those demonstrations took place during the day, though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wusa9.com\/article\/news\/local\/dc\/washington-dc-police-budget-councilmember-protests\/65-1933d1d1-f3d5-404a-acc9-03d7c09bbea4\">not all of them<\/a>. Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s home has been the site of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/07\/15\/activists-protest-outside-bowsers-home-saying-her-policies-harm-black-washingtonians\/\">multiple protests<\/a> over the past few years, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/06\/13\/ahead-of-mondays-police-budget-hearing-a-large-crowd-takes-to-bowsers-house-to-protest-and-party\/\">dance party<\/a>\u00a0in June.<\/p>\n<p>Ang\u00e9lica says the tactic is especially important in 2020 because the pandemic bars protesters from going to public officials\u2019 offices and restricts most hearings to virtual forums, making it harder to contact politicians or find venues to protest them. But putting COVID-era restrictions aside, she believes there\u2019s still a place for a home visit.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf D.C. residents are up all night worried about how they\u2019re going to pay their rent \u2026 worried about eviction, why do you get to sleep a peaceful night?\u201d she says. \u201cIs it annoying for the neighbors? Yeah. Is it annoying for D.C. residents not to have housing protection? It\u2019s more than annoying \u2014 it\u2019s life threatening.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does this have to do with the at-large race?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By October 14, Goodwin followed up his initial statement with a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoodWinForDC\/status\/1316521180468318208\">shot across the bow<\/a> at Lazere, one of his competitors in the at-large race. Both of them are seen as top-tier candidates, with Goodwin representing the more business-friendly perspective and Lazere earning the endorsement of most of the city\u2019s labor unions and left-leaning groups, including Sunrise Movement DC.<\/p>\n<p>Goodwin accused Lazere of encouraging Sunrise to protest at officials\u2019 homes.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThree days before the Sunrise Movement went to Anita Bonds\u2019 house, stood in the street, and waved stolen and vandalized campaign signs of mine, Ed told them in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tDGOXr1p_5M\">an interview<\/a> to stand outside the homes of elected officials and get in their faces,\u201d Goodwin tells DCist. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>He also said that a family living in his former residence was woken up by protesters with the group (the social media account he included in his statement appears to be from a different hub of the Sunrise Movement associated with the School Without Walls, not the chapter that endorsed Lazere). Goodwin called on Lazere to \u201cdisavow their actions and their endorsement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lazere and Ang\u00e9lica, meanwhile, both deny that he had anything to do with the protest outside of Bonds\u2019 house.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I praised [Sunrise Movement DC] for their activism, including visiting councilmembers at their homes, and encouraged them to do the same to me if elected,\u201d says Lazere. \u201cI was commenting on something they\u2019ve already done. I read about the protests [at Bonds\u2019 house] like everybody else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>So what\u2019s this I hear about a counterprotest?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Goodwin\u2019s statement tying Sunrise to Lazere came out on Wednesday. That evening, a group of people organizing under the banner \u201cProtect Black Women\u201d appeared outside Lazere\u2019s house to protest, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wusa9.com\/amp\/article\/news\/local\/protests\/dc-politicians-see-late-night-protests-at-their-homes\/65-79be3bb7-d073-4b9c-bc8f-7d3eb6dd7473\">WUSA 9<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Fitness professional Gym Jonez says he was one of the protesters. \u201cEleven-thirty, midnight should not be the time to protest a 75-year-old elderly woman. There\u2019s got to be some boundaries to this thing,\u201d he says, adding that after seeing the protest at Bonds\u2019 house, he \u201ccalled up some friends of mine who felt the same way\u201d to go to Lazere\u2019s house and demand an apology on behalf of Bonds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe wanted him to say, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t condone that,&#8217;\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe\u2019re just a group of passionate Black and brown people who care about the community, who just want some atonement for the action.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lazere says that \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d for the group to protest at his house, while noting that he\u2019s skeptical about the protesters\u2019 claims.<\/p>\n<p>If the demonstrators opposed \u201cprotesting at someone\u2019s house, particularly a Black woman\u2019s house, then they violated their own rule by protesting at my house,\u201d says Lazere. (While he is white, his wife is Black.) \u201cIt just felt like a campaign stunt \u2026 It\u2019s a little surprising that this group would come together organically so quickly to protect a councilmember if they hadn\u2019t had a connection already, given that the only criticism that connected me to Anita Bonds came from Marcus Goodwin.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Goodwin denies any ties to Jonez and says he doesn\u2019t \u201chave any real strong opinion\u201d about the counterprotest, adding \u201cBut honestly, [Lazere] got a taste of exactly what he was advocating for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jonez also says he and the \u201cProtect Black Women\u201d protesters are not connected to Goodwin, and he isn\u2019t even sure who he\u2019ll vote for in the at-large race. \u201cWe just came together,\u201d Jonez says. \u201cWe just saw, hey, they\u2019re picking on an older Black woman \u2026 We just wanted to be the voice for someone who, we knew she wasn\u2019t going to fight back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bonds, meanwhile, appears to be trying to create some distance between herself and the tactics of the group that claims it\u2019s fighting back on her behalf.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just think it is very disrespectful to demonstrate late at night, and disturb the peace in my neighborhood, or anyone\u2019s neighborhood,\u201d she said in a statement to DCist. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the various groups of protesters are, but I do believe their tactics crossed the line, and are wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do things stand now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite the efforts of the counterprotesters, Lazere did not disavow the Sunrise Movement. Quite the opposite. He came out with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edfordc.com\/news\/i-support-protest\/\">a statement<\/a> that reaffirmed his support for protesting, tying it to the \u201cgood trouble\u201d that Congressman John Lewis called for.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0don\u2019t want to lose sight of the larger issue \u2014 the bigger thing to say here is that people have a right to protest, whether it\u2019s at my house or Anita Bonds\u2019 house,\u201d says Lazere, who sees Goodwin\u2019s comments as a \u201cthreat to protest generally, and that does bother me. That\u2019s just trying to stifle debate and particularly trying to stop systemic change, and that\u2019s clearly wrong.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Goodwin contends that he does back protests, to a degree:\u00a0\u201cI totally support protest, but not in the way that goes beyond decency,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>A demonstration has led to a counterprotest, a

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes, I wrote and led the effort to continue and fund the current pilot program through the end of FY25 until we can consider a more permanent or expanded program in FY26. The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We made a significant investment in both the operating and capital budgets for ACPS in the FY25 budget allocating over $8 million in new revenue to ACPS out of $11.75 million in new revenue. In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes. These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the long run, property taxes are a terrible way to fund education. If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes. Along with public safety, our schools are our biggest budget priority and they will be a major focus for me on the City Council<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Lewis\"><\/a>James Lewis<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049092\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049092\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-900x675.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/James-Lewis-1600x1200.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>James Lewis.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy James Lewis campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>James Lewis is a lobbyist for a professional organization for pharmacists working with elderly patients.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding. We need to leverage the unique opportunities available to AHRA and our industrial development authority because we cannot keep waiting for Richmond to fund these needed projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I believe Zoning for Housing was a step in the right direction but much more must be done. Nothing in Z4H ensures that developers build the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d workforce housing or affordable housing. It\u2019s imperative that members of Council use their votes on each and every project to ensure that each project benefits Alexandria and meets the needs of our community members.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

When I look at the City budget, I am constantly reminded the local government is responsible for three major areas: public safety, infrastructure and education. We must do these things well because no other level of government can address them or provide the needed investments. Our schools must be fully funded.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#McPike\"><\/a>Kirk McPike<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049097\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049097\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Kirk McPike.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Kirk McPike campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kirk McPike is a current member of the City Council.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of the roughly $11 million the city would gain from a 2.5 cent increase in property taxes, the council will send $8.7 million to ACPS \u2014 $4.7 million for capital contributions and $4 million for the operating budget. This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
