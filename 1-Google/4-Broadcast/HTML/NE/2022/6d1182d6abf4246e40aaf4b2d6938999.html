Journalism.\n\nJohn and his wife, Sue, raised five children and have six grandchildren.\n\nJohn served as Sportscaster for WOWT from 1974 to 1981, at which time he moved to St. Louis in the same capacity for KTVI, the ABC affiliate. He returned to Omaha and KETV in May 1984, and made the move back to WOWT Channel 6 in May 1992, this time as Anchor of the 5, 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts.\n\nSince that time John has become a favorite in the community through his \"John at Work\" and \"Knicely Done\" news features. Over the years, he has given viewers a unique behind-the-scenes perspective through his reporter-involved segments that have included: sky diving, working construction on the First National Tower and West Dodge Expressway, joining TV tower repairmen at 1,200 feet, riding an Olympic bobsled, a daredevil stunt plane ride, performing on stage at the Omaha Playhouse, and serving as a middle school principal.\n\nJohn has received numerous awards, including the Journalism Alumni Award of Excellence from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He is actively involved in the community, and emcees various charity events throughout the year.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wowt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":1,"last_updated_date":"2024-01-29T18:37:55.293Z","website_url":"/authors/john-knicely/","headlines":{"basic":"John Knicely"},"description":{"basic":"John Knicely co-anchors live at 4, 5, 6:30, and 10 p.m. nightly on 6 News WOWT."},"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"john.knicely@wowt.com"}],"type":"author","custom_gray_biovideouuid":"","hasVideoCenterVideo":false,"promo_items":{"basic":{"type":"image","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/d64b6135-36c2-4767-a565-750fae9eb6ca.jpg","auth":{"3":"f70c347283c371b848fe0dd6a2eef0ea010659f28b01419c6d06d3fdecaa8591"}}},"dataTransformedAt":"2024-05-31T04:33:12.225Z"},{"_id":"Erin-Sullivan","firstName":"Erin","lastName":"Sullivan","byline":"Erin Sullivan","role":"Anchor / Investigative Reporter","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/67c67449-8dc2-4179-b667-c741ecd694f8.jpg","email":"erin.sullivan@wowt.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ErinSullivanTV/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/erinsullivantv","bio_page":"/authors/Erin-Sullivan/","location":"Omaha, Neb.
