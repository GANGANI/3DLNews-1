About 9% of Nebraskans have received their second dose of the vaccine, he said.

After consulting with the County Attorney, the Lancaster County Sheriff's office says a preliminary investigation shows law officers from the Nebraska State Patrol and Lincoln Police were legally justified in using deadly force against two people from Wyoming wanted in a northwest Lincoln robbery.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Investigators say 26 year old Christian Alexander, of Evansville, Wyoming, died Tuesday afternoon, and an autopsy is scheduled as the investigation continues. 30 year old Hailey Stainbrook, of Casper, Wyoming, died Saturday following the shooting.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Law enforcement say they have reviewed video evidence from the in-car cameras, body worn cameras and security footage from businesses where Alexander and Stainbrook went. They say Stainbrook and the victim of the armed robbery met up Friday evening and spent some time together at the robbery victim’s hotel. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The sheriff's office says a State Trooper located a white trailblazer parked in front of a convenience store on Superior Street and pulled his cruiser behind it. They say Stainbrook backed into the trooper's vehicle, before driving away. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The trooper pursued the suspects on Superior. At 14th Street, the pursuit went north, and, at Alvo Road, the trooper attempted an unsuccessful intervention technique. The pursuit went to the N. 56th and Arbor Rd area where another effort to stop it was attempted. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>At this time, investigators say Alexander pointed a handgun out of the window at the trooper. Two troopers and a Lincoln Police officer, identified as 19 year veteran Jesse Hilger, were at the scene. The Nebraska State Patrol has not publicly identified the troopers involved, as they continue their internal investigation. The vehicle eventually came to rest in the southbound traffic lanes of N. 56th (U.S. 77) below the I-80 bridge. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The Sheriff's office says Alexander pointed the handgun at officers, and they fired their weapons. When the threat from Alexander was over, negotiations began with Stainbrook to have her drop the weapon she had. They say these negotiations lasted approximately 7 minutes and ended when Stainbrook pointed her weapon at officers and a state trooper fired his weapon. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ballistic and forensic evidence is being examined to determine which of the suspects may have fired a revolver recovered from the vehicle. The revolver had live rounds and a fired round in the weapon. Another semi-automatic pistol, recovered from the Trailblazer, turned out to be a .177 cal. pellet pistol, a SIG Sauer lookalike.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Investigators have been in contact with both Alexander and Stainbrook’s families, who have assisted in the investigation. The Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office and the Lincoln Police Department are continuing their respective investigations into this incident.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The Nebraska State Patrol released the following statement Wednesday morning in regards to the incident:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cblockquote>Colonel John Bolduc, Superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol, issues the following statement upon the announcement from Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner that law enforcement actions were justified during an officer-involved shooting Saturday morning in Lincoln.\u003c/blockquote>\n\n\u003cblockquote>\u003cem>“\u003c/em>\u003cem>We’d like to thank the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office for their diligent and thorough investigation into Saturday’s incident,” \u003c/em>said Colonel Bolduc.\u003cem> “All NSP personnel continue to cooperate fully with that investigation.

The victim told detectives that the assaults lasted into 2017. The charges came after the girl, now attending college in another state, came forward in December 2019 and led investigators to evidence of the encounters in December 2020, the documents state. Omaha Police say due to the trauma, the victim reported she was hesitant to come forth but was doing so because she felt that Powell might have also victimized others. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Powell was originally hired by OPS in December 2014 as a coach, and then became a full-time security guard at Omaha North the following March. According to court documents, an OPS official said Powell was fired in August 2016 after repeated violations of the school district’s policy on student interactions and instances of “poor judgment,” such as taking photographs with students and providing his cell number to two females students. Still, he did volunteer to coach girls basketball through Omaha Bryan High School as late as January 2020. OPD says staff at Bryan were made aware of the case against Powell and he was immediately released from coaching. He was not a paid staff member at Bryan.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>District leaders said “he would attempt to counsel students who were having personal problems, which is not within the scope of his job description,” court documents state. A school district report also identified two female students Powell had “inappropriate relationships with,” and that both students had “corroborated these unwanted advances.” One of the alleged victims said in an interview with authorities in November 2019 that she’d had what she thought was a consensual committed relationship with Powell, and that at one time he had helped her get an abortion.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She told authorities that she lost her virginity to Powell after an escalating relationship with him starting in October 2015, the documents state. She told investigators that the two of them would regularly meet in a “book closet” — which was reportedly locked and only accessible by staff — to talk and kiss, and that those encounters led to further sexual activity just before she turned 16.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After she turned 16, she said, Powell reserved hotel rooms for them to meet and have sex in, telling her she deserved better than the closet. Court documents state that she told authorities that she got pregnant in April 2017 and that Powell took her to Planned Parenthood for an abortion, pretending to be her father in order to obtain an abortion pill for the girl.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She said she stayed silent about the relationship until she was in college because “she felt responsible for protecting Powell and she felt she was in a legitimate healthy relationship that she was committed to,” court documents state. Later, she said, she realized that the experience robbed her of her high school experiences; still affected by the ordeal, she said she wanted to “make sure he does not do this to any other young girls.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The case was put on pause when the alleged victim was unable to participate in the investigation after authorities asked her to accompany them to the book closet to help them search for evidence, the documents state. She reached out about a year after she came forward to help the case move forward, and led authorities to a flag in the closet she said Powell would lay sweatshirts on before they had sex.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When meeting with authorities in January 2021, Powell said he never had inappropriate relationships with any students because he was married at the time. Court documents state that during the course of the conversation with investigators, he admitted to having Facebook conversations with the victim, but denied having a sexual relationship with her or having sex with anyone in the book closet.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lab analysis of the flag found DNA material from four people, according to the documents. Powell declined to voluntarily take a DNA test at that time, so a warrant was issued for the test. Lab results did not exclude him as a “contributor to the DNA profile” collected in evidence, the court documents state.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the investigation, police say detectives learned that Powell would groom young girls by promising to help them get a college scholarship. OPD says they believe that Powell may have used the same tactic to get other young girls' phone numbers and eventually sexually assault them. The Omaha Police say they have reason to believe that there may be other victims who have not come forward. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>OPD says they understand that Reporting a sexual assault can be a traumatic experience and recognize the emotional hardship and courage of coming forward. You can report any incident of sexual assault to police by calling 911, regardless of how long ago it happened.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>(Photo by WOWT 6 News)\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://kfab.iheart.com/content/2021-02-18-former-ops-security-guard-charged-with-felony-child-sex-assault/","cuser":"user/ldap/1113356","exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"feed_content_id":"","feed_permalink":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":[],"primary_image":{"bucket":"new_assets","id":"%2F602ec86d6db29a10ec0a5812"},"primary_target":{"categories":[],"distribution":["brands/KFAB-AM (611)","collections/1110 KFAB Local News (122285)","brands/KFAB Local News","collections/local-news"]},"publish_date":1613680380000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/KFAB-AM (611)","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2021-02-18-former-ops-security-guard-charged-with-felony-child-sex-assault","social_title":"","summary":"Ronald Powell is accused of sexually assaulting a girl in October 2015 while he was working as a security guard at Omaha North High School.","targets":[],"title":"Former OPS security guard charged with felony child sex assault"},"subscription":[{"tags":["brands/KFAB-AM (611)","collections/1110 KFAB Local News (122285)","brands/KFAB Local News","collections/local-news"]}]},{"slug":"2021-02-18-nebraska-could-start-covid-19-vaccines-for-general-population-by-april","pub_start":1613676720000,"summary":{"title":"Nebraska could start COVID-19 vaccines for general population by April"},"payload":{"amp_enabled":true,"apple_news":null,"author":"Julia Bertino","blocks":[{"html":"\u003cp>(Lincoln, NE)  --  COVID-19 vaccine doses could be available for most Nebraskans by April. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During his coronavirus update on Thursday, Governor Pete Ricketts said that an increase in COVID-19 vaccine production plus the expected addition of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine could mean that doses may be available for all Nebraskans as soon as April.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the update, Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services Incident Commander Angie Ling said that DHHS is now counting all six doses in each Pfizer vial, instead of five, giving the state a bump in its COVID-19 vaccine allocation numbers.

We don’t have a way to store large amounts of energy,” he said. Instead, he said people in control centers work “every day, every hour” to balance consumption.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>While many outages were implemented and restored Tuesday morning, “we are not out of the woods,” Kent said. More outages and interruptions could happen Tuesday evening, or even the next couple of days, depending on usage loads he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As of late Tuesday afternoon, SPP had dropped down to energy emergency alert level one, meaning electricity reserves were at a more maintainable level. Although the emergency level was dropped, utility companies are still asking customers to continue using electricity conserving measures. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>NPPD implemented four times the interruptions Tuesday morning as compared to Monday, Kent said. The power load comparison was 40 megawatts on Monday to 178 megawatts on Tuesday, he said. The advantage of being part of a multi-state grid, he said, is that the power companies can help each other out “and keep the lights on” when specific grids are taxed. It also provides lower cost and less risk for everyone, he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In determining what areas to temporarily shut down, Kent said that NPPD looks at the system across the state to see how their breakers are serving certain communities and understand the power loads on those breakers. Kent said engineers manage the system as effectively as possible, account for emergencies and use that information to manage the list of what breakers would go dark. “It’s a pretty complicated process to identify loads that aren’t critical, to identify the best way to mg the system and acct for other risks that could happen, and to spread it around in a way that makes sense and minimized the impact to any one area as best we can,” the NPPD CEO said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Kent said he couldn’t recall any time that rolling outages were implemented during the winter due to high power demands, but that those sorts of blackouts were put into effect in July 2012 when the state was in a severe drought, and irrigation demand was high, particularly in the central and northern central parts of Nebraska.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>(Photo by Nebraska Public Power District)\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://kfab.iheart.com/content/2021-02-16-nppd-rolling-outages-may-resume-tuesday-evening-and-into-the-coming-days/","cuser":"user/ldap/1113356","exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"feed_content_id":"","feed_permalink":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":[],"primary_image":{"bucket":"new_assets","id":"%2F602c338f985a500477c1e6a2"},"primary_target":{"categories":[],"distribution":["brands/KFAB-AM (611)","collections/1110 KFAB Local News (122285)","brands/KFAB Local News","collections/local-news"]},"publish_date":1613509860000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/KFAB-AM (611)","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2021-02-16-nppd-rolling-outages-may-resume-tuesday-evening-and-into-the-coming-days","social_title":"","summary":"More outages and interruptions could happen Tuesday evening, or even the next couple of days, depending on usage loads.","targets":[],"title":"NPPD: Rolling outages may resume Tuesday evening and into the coming days"},"subscription":[{"tags":["brands/KFAB-AM (611)","collections/1110 KFAB Local News (122285)","brands/KFAB Local News","collections/local-news"]}]},{"slug":"2021-02-16-creighton-leaders-release-statement-on-alleged-sexual-assault","pub_start":1613508480000,"summary":{"title":"Creighton leaders release statement on alleged sexual assault"},"payload":{"amp_enabled":true,"apple_news":null,"author":"Julia Bertino","blocks":[{"html":"\u003cp>(Omaha, NE)  --  Creighton University leaders have released a statement about a reported sexual assault on campus. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On Monday, WOWT 6 News reported that they had received an anonymous tip about students getting an alert that notified reports of the incident.

Vice President of Animal Management Dan Cassidy tells WOWT 6 News that the return water in the feature can be warmed up to 65 degrees. &quot;So, not the temperature we would like to take a bath in but for the sea lions—they’ll be out cruising around.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Each species is unique though, with different needs during this polar vortex. Cassidy says every animal at the zoo has a team monitoring them 24/7 when temps drop, and they all have a heated indoor facility they can stay in for safety. “Because it’s so cold a lot of the animals that would ordinarily be outside will have access. We call it access so the door will be open so they can choose to come or go. But some will be locked in, like the lions.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>But Cassidy says, some animals may surprise you. “The cheetahs from Africa, that you would think would only be in a warm climate, they’ll go outside almost every single day.” They even have heated rocks inside their exhibit to keep them toasty.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the Asian Highlands exhibit, most animals will stay outside even on Sunday with an expected high of negative one. “The snow leopard, the Siberian tiger, the takin, those guys will be outside no problem,” said Cassidy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>It’s not just the animals the team here has to worry about, though. Leaders with the zoo say not many people brave the cold during a week like this one. But there is the occasional few. “We do encourage them to spend some time indoors.

Police say a 79 year old victim told officers that he noticed a Dodge Dakota stuck in a snow drift by his house, so he offered to help dig the vehicle out. Investigators say the disabled vehicle was driven by 27 year old Hieu Nguyen and that as the victim began digging the truck out, Nguyen jumped out of the truck and entered the victim’s vehicle, a Volkswagen Jetta. LPD says the victim ran back to his vehicle and tried to grab the steering wheel, but Nguyen accelerated away, dragging the victim, causing pain and discomfort.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Around 3:30 Wednesday afternoon, LPD says officers determined that the Dodge Dakota, left at the first scene by Nguyen, had been stolen from the 6800 block of A Street just before 3:00 earlier that afternoon. Police say the 58 year old truck owner did not yet know his vehicle was stolen.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Just before 9:00 Wednesday night, investigators say officers were called to a crash at North 84th Street and Adams Street. Once on the scene, officers learned that a vehicle, driven by Nguyen, had been eastbound on Adams Street when he violated the red traffic light and hit two other vehicles. Police say the crash severely damaged all three vehicles and sent two people to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>LPD says officers spoke with an 18 year old victim, who was not involved in the collision, that told them that he’d come upon the crash scene and exited his vehicle to help the crash victims. Police say Nguyen then got into the 18 year old’s vehicle and left the scene of the crash, making it the third vehicle he stole that day.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Investigators say around 9:00, Nguyen returned to the scene of the crash, in the vehicle he had just stolen, and drove into the back of an LFR fire engine. Police say Nguyen continued through the crash scene, and as officers attempted to pull him over, he refused to stop. LPD says officers pursued Nguyen, but terminated the pursuit out of regard for public safety.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Then at 9:30, LPD says officers located Nguyen, in the stolen vehicle, and again attempted to stop the vehicle at South 25th Street and M Street.  Investigators say Nguyen stopped, but when officers approached the vehicle, he accelerated away from the scene and intentionally slammed his vehicle head-on into a marked police cruiser, causing neck and back pain to the officer and disabling both vehicles. Police say Nguyen disobeyed commands from police officers and continued to start his vehicle to try to flee the scene. Investigators say eventually, officers were forced to break out the rear window of the vehicle and deploy a Taser.  \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>LPD says Nguyen continued to fight with officers, who had physically removed him from the vehicle. Officers transported Nguyen to a local area hospital for evaluation and treatment. He sustained minor facial injuries during the crash at North 84th Street and Adams Street.

The retail pharmacy program is also expected to start early next week, Ling said, bringing COVID-19 vaccination doses to select Walmart and locally-owned pharmacies that utilize drug company AmerisourceBergen as a distributor as well as those in the CardinalHealth system. “This is additional product coming into the state,” she said. “This is not pulling from our state’s allocation.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ling said the state doesn’t have more specific information on the amount of doses heading for those pharmacies, as those companies work directly with the pharmacies, which then inform the state. “We have no expectation at this point,” she said.
