Neb. (KSNB) - Some folks north of the Tri-Cities got a bit more rain than they bargained for creating unwanted water front property along the highway 92 corridor in Sherman and Howards counties earlier this morning. While things have been generally rain free for most this afternoon, we are not done with the rain just yet as another round will be moving through this evening. Unfortunately, this could roll over areas that received a deluge this morning. A few strong to severe storms are possible before 10pm this evening. The primary threats will be large hail to around quarter size and severe wind gusts to 60 mph.  An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out. A few more showers and thunderstorms will continue into tonight. Lows tonight will drop into the 50s and lower 60s."},{"_id":"5K56SRMUW5B3LDEOIG6RLUFOMA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Some showers and isolated thunderstorms will remain in the forecast tomorrow.

The 80s will return Monday with just a slight chance of thunderstorms later in the day. One more day of widespread 80s and even a few lower 90s is expected Tuesday.

","longBio":"David graduated from Florida State University in April 2021 with a BS degree in Meteorology.\n\nDavid was born and raised in Pennsylvania until the age of 12. It was in his birth state where he developed a passion for understanding the weather. He grew up in central Pennsylvania along the Juniata River where he experienced severe storms, flooding and winter weather.\n\nAt age 12, his family moved to Florida where David discovered another aspect of severe weather: tropical cyclones and sea breeze thunderstorms. The unique weather systems that effect Florida increased his passion for studying weather.\n\nDavid took different paths in life which eventually led him to pursue his passion of studying meteorology and earning his degree at FSU. Before pursuing a degree in meteorology, he worked as a youth pastor for a few years. He then went on to study to be an occupational therapy assistant. He hopes to continue working as an OTA from time to time to keep up his licensing.\n\nWhen he is not focused on weather, David enjoys flying drones, hiking, storm chasing, golfing, playing video games, fishing, watching movies, or just relaxing with his two dogs. One of his all-time favorite movies is Twister. When it’s college football season, David is all about the Garnet and Gold. He might be living in Nebraska, but he is a diehard Florida State Seminole fan.\n\nDavid’s faith is important to him and believes that this opportunity to serve the community of Hastings and surrounding areas is a blessing. He looks forward to getting to know the people he serves.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ksnb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"27","last_updated_date":"2023-06-21T14:28:44.333Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/DavidStoltzLocal4/","twitter":"DavidStoltz_WX"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T22:54:10.600Z","description":{"basic":"Another

While heavy rain, frequent lightning, and some small hail is possible, severe weather is unlikely this morning.  There could be some areas of flooding as some around parts of Howard and Sherman County have picked up 2 to 5 inches of rain.  With the set-up that we are in, some areas are going to get heavier rain like this, while others get very little.  The chance of showers and thunderstorms will continue and may pick up a bit this evening.  While widespread severe weather is not expected, a little better chance for some isolated severe storms will come during the late afternoon and evening.  The more sunshine that can come out, the better the chance is of seeing some severe weather.  Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible. An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out.  A few more showers and thunderstorms will continue into tonight.  Temperatures will be cooler today as highs will mostly be in the 70s.

","longBio":"David graduated from Florida State University in April 2021 with a BS degree in Meteorology.\n\nDavid was born and raised in Pennsylvania until the age of 12. It was in his birth state where he developed a passion for understanding the weather. He grew up in central Pennsylvania along the Juniata River where he experienced severe storms, flooding and winter weather.\n\nAt age 12, his family moved to Florida where David discovered another aspect of severe weather: tropical cyclones and sea breeze thunderstorms. The unique weather systems that effect Florida increased his passion for studying weather.\n\nDavid took different paths in life which eventually led him to pursue his passion of studying meteorology and earning his degree at FSU. Before pursuing a degree in meteorology, he worked as a youth pastor for a few years. He then went on to study to be an occupational therapy assistant. He hopes to continue working as an OTA from time to time to keep up his licensing.\n\nWhen he is not focused on weather, David enjoys flying drones, hiking, storm chasing, golfing, playing video games, fishing, watching movies, or just relaxing with his two dogs. One of his all-time favorite movies is Twister. When it’s college football season, David is all about the Garnet and Gold. He might be living in Nebraska, but he is a diehard Florida State Seminole fan.\n\nDavid’s faith is important to him and believes that this opportunity to serve the community of Hastings and surrounding areas is a blessing.

Nebraska for nearly three decades. Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at

The horse, called No. 415, was born and bred at the famous Pitzer Ranch in Ericson and is a once-in-a-lifetime performance horse. He was purchased as a weanling by Mark Wray and then trained by the Wray family. Troy loved the idea and while they couldn’t specifically write that into the contract, the retention bonus will be used for No. 415.

Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at
