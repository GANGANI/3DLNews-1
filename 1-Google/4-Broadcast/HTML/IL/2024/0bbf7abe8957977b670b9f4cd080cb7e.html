willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen, including about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan, but concluded that criminal charges were not warranted.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The report from special counsel Robert Hur resolves a criminal investigation that had shadowed Biden&#x27;s presidency for the last year. But its bitingly critical assessment of his handling of sensitive government records and unflattering characterizations of his memory will spark fresh questions about his competency and age that cut at voters&#x27; most deep-seated concerns about his candidacy for re-election.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Beyond that, the harsh findings will almost certainly blunt his ability to forcefully condemn Donald Trump, Biden&#x27;s likely opponent in November&#x27;s presidential election, over a criminal indictment charging the former president with illegally hoarding classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Despite abundant differences between the cases, Trump immediately seized on the special counsel report to portray himself as a victim of a &quot;two-tiered system of justice.&quot;</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy"><b class="cXscX">ALSO SEE:</b><a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="/president-joe-biden-documents-doj-report-special-counsel/14403109/" target="_blank"> Takeaways from special counsel&#x27;s report into Biden&#x27;s handling of classified documents</a></p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Yet even as Hur found evidence that Biden willfully held onto and shared with a ghostwriter highly classified information, the special counsel devoted much of his report to explaining why he did not believe the evidence met the standard for criminal charges, including a high probability that the Justice Department would not be able to prove Biden&#x27;s intent beyond a reasonable doubt, citing among other things an advanced age that they said made him forgetful and the possibility of &quot;innocent explanations&quot; for the records that they could not refute.</p><div class="oLzSq QrHMO GbsKS pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW AMhAA daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc ebfE nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY VvTxJ iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM hbvnu OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD iShaE ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV kRoBe oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "><div data-testid="prism-ad-wrapper" style="transition:min-height 0.3s linear 1s" data-ad-placeholder="true"><div data-box-type="fitt-adbox-fitt-article-inline-outstream" data-testid="prism-ad"><div class="Ad fitt-article-inline-outstream  ad-slot  " data-slot-type="fitt-article-inline-outstream" data-slot-kvps="pos=fitt-article-inline-outstream-1"></div></div></div></div><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">In remarks at the White House, Biden denied Hur&#x27;s assertion that he shared classified information, saying, &quot;I did not share classified information.

In October, Hur&#x27;s team spent two days interviewing Biden himself.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">ABC News previously reported that sources who were present for some of the interviews, including witnesses, said that authorities had apparently uncovered instances of carelessness from Biden&#x27;s vice presidency, but that -- based on what was said in the interviews -- the improper removal of classified documents from Biden&#x27;s office when he left the White House in 2017 seemed to be more likely a mistake than a criminal act.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The White House had emphasized from the beginning that it would cooperate with investigators. Biden himself repeatedly denied any personal wrongdoing and said he was &quot;surprised&quot; to learn of the documents&#x27; existence.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">The Hur investigation has played out quietly against the backdrop of special counsel Jack Smith&#x27;s inquiry into former President Donald Trump&#x27;s handling of classified records, which culminated last year in a 40-count indictment, to which Trump has pleaded not guilty.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Trump has sought to link his circumstances to Biden&#x27;s by trying to draw an equivalence between their conduct and calling his prosecution the result of a justice system improperly targeting Republicans.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">But records subsequently released by the National Archives indicate that Biden&#x27;s legal team cooperated with National Archives officials, whereas federal prosecutors have accused Trump of deliberately withholding records he knew to be classified from investigators with the National Archives and, later, the FBI.</p><p class="EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy">Hur&#x27;s report drew that distinction, saying, &quot;Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it.&quot;</p><p
