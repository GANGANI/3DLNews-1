Yesterday was picture-perfect with low humidity and mild temperatures in the mid-70s. Not much is going to change for today's forecast. We will have another sunny start with temperatures in the low 50s. We will have another steady warm-up today with temperatures in the 70s for most of the afternoon with plenty of sunshine through the evening. Enjoy today because we will see major changes heading our way by the weekend.{/p}{p}Friday looks great, just a few degrees warmer than Thursday and a mix of sun and clouds. The big changes in our weather pattern will move in starting Friday night. We can expect the overcast conditions to turn to rain chances through the morning on Saturday. We might see a lull in the rain around midday, but another round of showers and a few thunderstorms are expected through the afternoon. We could see anywhere from a quarter to a half inch of rain through Saturday evening before things start drying out.{/p}{p}Sunday is looking a touch warmer in the low 80s with partly cloudy skies. An unsettled weather pattern will move in and linger through the middle of next week.

Dry for the remainder of the day. {strong}High{/strong}: 81 {strong}Low{/strong}: 65{/p}{p}Our weather pattern has been very pleasant as of late.  Temperatures have been mild and we've been soaking in the sunshine. We've got more of the same for the rest of the work week with a gradual warming trend.  High pressure is in place and has brought the drier air into the region. That is responsible for the refreshing feel we can detect while being outdoors. However, the start of June will bring some changes. Warmer air and increased humidity are coming, making it feel a little more muggy.{/p}{p}Our Next Weather Maker is pushing through the Eastern Rockies today. We won't see that until we're getting into the weekend forecast. Showers and thunderstorms are what this will bring to Central Illinois, but we're not expecting any severe weather with this. Storms will mainly bring brief heavy rain and gusty winds.  We'll see the storm activity on Saturday, but I think we get a little break on Sunday.{/p}{p}High temperatures return to the low 80s starting on Sunday and then we'll warm up around the mid 80s for our first week of June. With the humidity coming in, these temperatures will feel like we're around the low 90s. Showers and thunderstorms look like they'll at least stick around through the midweek.{/p}{p}{strong}Darren Leeds - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}{a href=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\"}Click here for interactive radar{&nbsp;}{/a}{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Watch FOX-Illinois News weeknights at 5:30 and 9 pm on WCCU/WRSP FOX Illinois or at Foxillinois.com{br}{/strong}{/p}{h2}Have a great weather photo?

responders walk a fine line when they're called to an emergency: getting somewhere quickly yet safely.{/p}{p}This weekend, 25-year-old Kelly Wilson died after an accident with a responding Illinois State Police car.{/p}{p}Racing to an emergency is the most important time for a first responder. America Ambulance drivers said it's also the most dangerous time.{/p}{p}The balance between safe and fast driving is narrow. An accident can mean life or death for a patient, an EMT, and even other drivers.{/p}{p}For 24 hours an Emergency Medical Technician team will drive around in its ambulance called a rig.{/p}{p}It can be quiet for hours from day to night, but that can change in a heartbeat.{/p}{p}Ashley Meredith has worked at America Ambulance for a year. She said she drives most of her 24-hour shift and follows the speed limit.{/p}{p}That's until those lights and sirens start flashing. On the highway, where she said she's gone 90 miles per hour once, and on streets in Springfield.{/p}{p}\"Keep it with what I can safely manage the rig at with traffic,\" said Meredith.{/p}{p}On a call Newschannel 20 joined, Meredith drives at more than 60 miles per hour. Your patient, passengers, other drivers, their lives in your hands.{/p}{p}\"Knowing that you have a patient in the back who needs critical transport; you get kind of frustrated sometimes,\" she said.{/p}{p}The frustration comes from other drivers. If you hear an ambulance coming you're supposed to slow down and pull to the right when it's safe, but ambulance drivers said that often does not happen.{/p}{p}\"You get a lot of people who will slam on their brakes and kind of panic,\" she said. \"Some people go left. Some people go right and you have to get between them.\"{/p}{p}She said for first responders, intersections are the most dangerous. When all drivers aren't on the same page it can turn to tragedy.{/p}{p}EMT paramedic Michael Spurgeon, says he's had a close call.{/p}{p}\"I ended up pretty much right here. In between this jump seat and this wall. Hit my head,\" he said recalling the incident.{/p}{p}Spurgeon kept working on his patient. He sits in the back of Ashley Meredith's ambulance, working on patients while she drives.{/p}{p}\"A lot of the times we can't be seat-belted in because we're doing so many interventions on the patient,\" said Spurgeon.{/p}{p}At least one first responder is in the back, creating a mobile ER.{/p}{p}Hardly ideal working conditions, just feet of crammed working space around a patient.{/p}{p}\"You got only so much space here and I lean over and I have to put a tube down someone's throat while we're moving,\" he said. \"That's a pretty difficult thing to do CPR while we're moving, we do that.\"{/p}{p}He said it feels like a boat rocking.{/p}{p}\"You don't know where the bumps are at because you're not paying attention to the road,\" he said.{/p}{p}EMTs say other drivers being aware and safe can mean everyone on the road lives to see another day.{/p}{p}\"It's the little things that can make our jobs easier and safer,\" said Spurgeon.{/p}{p}EMTs say if you hear an ambulance do not panic. Move over to the right hand lane when it's safe to do so but do not stop in order to change lanes.{/p}","readAloud":null,"isReadAloudChecked":false,"derivedImages":{"imageTotal":3,"externalId":"d37a89f1-4491-44b5-ba5d-0cb52a087b2a","indexOfHeroImageInPackageMedia":0,"heroImageFromPackageMedia":{"type":"Image","uuid":"5c448456-0e43-4c5c-8acd-ccd14222f224","title":"Racing to an emergency is the most important time for a first responder.

Yesterday was picture-perfect with low humidity and mild temperatures in the mid-70s. Not much is going to change for today's forecast. We will have another sunny start with temperatures in the low 50s. We will have another steady warm-up today with temperatures in the 70s for most of the afternoon with plenty of sunshine through the evening. Enjoy today because we will see major changes heading our way by the weekend.{/p}{p}Friday looks great, just a few degrees warmer than Thursday and a mix of sun and clouds. The big changes in our weather pattern will move in starting Friday night. We can expect the overcast conditions to turn to rain chances through the morning on Saturday. We might see a lull in the rain around midday, but another round of showers and a few thunderstorms are expected through the afternoon. We could see anywhere from a quarter to a half inch of rain through Saturday evening before things start drying out.{/p}{p}Sunday is looking a touch warmer in the low 80s with partly cloudy skies. An unsettled weather pattern will move in and linger through the middle of next week.

Dry for the remainder of the day. {strong}High{/strong}: 81 {strong}Low{/strong}: 65{/p}{p}Our weather pattern has been very pleasant as of late.  Temperatures have been mild and we've been soaking in the sunshine. We've got more of the same for the rest of the work week with a gradual warming trend.  High pressure is in place and has brought the drier air into the region. That is responsible for the refreshing feel we can detect while being outdoors. However, the start of June will bring some changes. Warmer air and increased humidity are coming, making it feel a little more muggy.{/p}{p}Our Next Weather Maker is pushing through the Eastern Rockies today. We won't see that until we're getting into the weekend forecast. Showers and thunderstorms are what this will bring to Central Illinois, but we're not expecting any severe weather with this. Storms will mainly bring brief heavy rain and gusty winds.  We'll see the storm activity on Saturday, but I think we get a little break on Sunday.{/p}{p}High temperatures return to the low 80s starting on Sunday and then we'll warm up around the mid 80s for our first week of June. With the humidity coming in, these temperatures will feel like we're around the low 90s. Showers and thunderstorms look like they'll at least stick around through the midweek.{/p}{p}{strong}Darren Leeds - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}{a href=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\"}Click here for interactive radar{&nbsp;}{/a}{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Watch FOX-Illinois News weeknights at 5:30 and 9 pm on WCCU/WRSP FOX Illinois or at Foxillinois.com{br}{/strong}{/p}{h2}Have a great weather photo?

responders walk a fine line when they're called to an emergency: getting somewhere quickly yet safely.{/p}{p}This weekend, 25-year-old Kelly Wilson died after an accident with a responding Illinois State Police car.{/p}{p}Racing to an emergency is the most important time for a first responder. America Ambulance drivers said it's also the most dangerous time.{/p}{p}The balance between safe and fast driving is narrow. An accident can mean life or death for a patient, an EMT, and even other drivers.{/p}{p}For 24 hours an Emergency Medical Technician team will drive around in its ambulance called a rig.{/p}{p}It can be quiet for hours from day to night, but that can change in a heartbeat.{/p}{p}Ashley Meredith has worked at America Ambulance for a year. She said she drives most of her 24-hour shift and follows the speed limit.{/p}{p}That's until those lights and sirens start flashing. On the highway, where she said she's gone 90 miles per hour once, and on streets in Springfield.{/p}{p}\"Keep it with what I can safely manage the rig at with traffic,\" said Meredith.{/p}{p}On a call Newschannel 20 joined, Meredith drives at more than 60 miles per hour. Your patient, passengers, other drivers, their lives in your hands.{/p}{p}\"Knowing that you have a patient in the back who needs critical transport; you get kind of frustrated sometimes,\" she said.{/p}{p}The frustration comes from other drivers. If you hear an ambulance coming you're supposed to slow down and pull to the right when it's safe, but ambulance drivers said that often does not happen.{/p}{p}\"You get a lot of people who will slam on their brakes and kind of panic,\" she said. \"Some people go left. Some people go right and you have to get between them.\"{/p}{p}She said for first responders, intersections are the most dangerous. When all drivers aren't on the same page it can turn to tragedy.{/p}{p}EMT paramedic Michael Spurgeon, says he's had a close call.{/p}{p}\"I ended up pretty much right here. In between this jump seat and this wall. Hit my head,\" he said recalling the incident.{/p}{p}Spurgeon kept working on his patient. He sits in the back of Ashley Meredith's ambulance, working on patients while she drives.{/p}{p}\"A lot of the times we can't be seat-belted in because we're doing so many interventions on the patient,\" said Spurgeon.{/p}{p}At least one first responder is in the back, creating a mobile ER.{/p}{p}Hardly ideal working conditions, just feet of crammed working space around a patient.{/p}{p}\"You got only so much space here and I lean over and I have to put a tube down someone's throat while we're moving,\" he said. \"That's a pretty difficult thing to do CPR while we're moving, we do that.\"{/p}{p}He said it feels like a boat rocking.{/p}{p}\"You don't know where the bumps are at because you're not paying attention to the road,\" he said.{/p}{p}EMTs say other drivers being aware and safe can mean everyone on the road lives to see another day.{/p}{p}\"It's the little things that can make our jobs easier and safer,\" said Spurgeon.{/p}{p}EMTs say if you hear an ambulance do not panic. Move over to the right hand lane when it's safe to do so but do not stop in order to change lanes.{/p}","readAloud":null,"isReadAloudChecked":false,"derivedImages":{"imageTotal":3,"externalId":"d37a89f1-4491-44b5-ba5d-0cb52a087b2a","indexOfHeroImageInPackageMedia":0,"heroImageFromPackageMedia":{"type":"Image","uuid":"5c448456-0e43-4c5c-8acd-ccd14222f224","title":"Racing to an emergency is the most important time for a first responder.

(WICS) — </span>First responders walk a fine line when they&#x27;re called to an emergency: getting somewhere quickly yet safely.</p><p>This weekend, 25-year-old Kelly Wilson died after an accident with a responding Illinois State Police car.</p><p>Racing to an emergency is the most important time for a first responder. America Ambulance drivers said it&#x27;s also the most dangerous time.</p><p>The balance between safe and fast driving is narrow. An accident can mean life or death for a patient, an EMT, and even other drivers.</p><p>For 24 hours an Emergency Medical Technician team will drive around in its ambulance called a rig.</p><p>It can be quiet for hours from day to night, but that can change in a heartbeat.</p><p>Ashley Meredith has worked at America Ambulance for a year. She said she drives most of her 24-hour shift and follows the speed limit.</p><p>That&#x27;s until those lights and sirens start flashing. On the highway, where she said she&#x27;s gone 90 miles per hour once, and on streets in Springfield.</p><p>&quot;Keep it with what I can safely manage the rig at with traffic,&quot; said Meredith.</p><p>On a call Newschannel 20 joined, Meredith drives at more than 60 miles per hour. Your patient, passengers, other drivers, their lives in your hands.</p><p>&quot;Knowing that you have a patient in the back who needs critical transport; you get kind of frustrated sometimes,&quot; she said.</p><p>The frustration comes from other drivers. If you hear an ambulance coming you&#x27;re supposed to slow down and pull to the right when it&#x27;s safe, but ambulance drivers said that often does not happen.</p><p>&quot;You get a lot of people who will slam on their brakes and kind of panic,&quot; she said. &quot;Some people go left. Some people go right and you have to get between them.&quot;</p><p>She said for first responders, intersections are the most dangerous. When all drivers aren&#x27;t on the same page it can turn to tragedy.</p><p>EMT paramedic Michael Spurgeon, says he&#x27;s had a close call.</p><p>&quot;I ended up pretty much right here. In between this jump seat and this wall. Hit my head,&quot; he said recalling the incident.</p><p>Spurgeon kept working on his patient. He sits in the back of Ashley Meredith&#x27;s ambulance, working on patients while she drives.</p><p>&quot;A lot of the times we can&#x27;t be seat-belted in because we&#x27;re doing so many interventions on the patient,&quot; said Spurgeon.</p><p>At least one first responder is in the back, creating a mobile ER.</p><p>Hardly ideal working conditions, just feet of crammed working space around a patient.</p><p>&quot;You got only so much space here and I lean over and I have to put a tube down someone&#x27;s throat while we&#x27;re moving,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s a pretty difficult thing to do CPR while we&#x27;re moving, we do that.&quot;</p><p>He said it feels like a boat rocking.</p><p>&quot;You don&#x27;t know where the bumps are at because you&#x27;re not paying attention to the road,&quot; he said.</p><p>EMTs say other drivers being aware and safe can mean everyone on the road lives to see another day.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s the little things that can make our jobs easier and safer,&quot; said Spurgeon.</p><p>EMTs say if you hear an ambulance do not panic. Move over to the right hand lane when it&#x27;s safe to do so but do not stop in order to change lanes.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="js-Taboola-Container-0" class="index-module_taboola__RgGF
