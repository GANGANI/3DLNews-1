Yesterday was picture-perfect with low humidity and mild temperatures in the mid-70s. Not much is going to change for today's forecast. We will have another sunny start with temperatures in the low 50s. We will have another steady warm-up today with temperatures in the 70s for most of the afternoon with plenty of sunshine through the evening. Enjoy today because we will see major changes heading our way by the weekend.{/p}{p}Friday looks great, just a few degrees warmer than Thursday and a mix of sun and clouds. The big changes in our weather pattern will move in starting Friday night. We can expect the overcast conditions to turn to rain chances through the morning on Saturday. We might see a lull in the rain around midday, but another round of showers and a few thunderstorms are expected through the afternoon. We could see anywhere from a quarter to a half inch of rain through Saturday evening before things start drying out.{/p}{p}Sunday is looking a touch warmer in the low 80s with partly cloudy skies. An unsettled weather pattern will move in and linger through the middle of next week. Rain and some storm chances will persist through Wednesday with temperatures hanging around the mid-80s through next weekend.{/p}{p}{strong}Nick Patrick - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Don't forget to use our interactive radar when active weather strikes Central Illinois.{/strong}{br}{/p}{p}{strong}Have a great weather photo?

Dry for the remainder of the day. {strong}High{/strong}: 81 {strong}Low{/strong}: 65{/p}{p}Our weather pattern has been very pleasant as of late.  Temperatures have been mild and we've been soaking in the sunshine. We've got more of the same for the rest of the work week with a gradual warming trend.  High pressure is in place and has brought the drier air into the region. That is responsible for the refreshing feel we can detect while being outdoors. However, the start of June will bring some changes. Warmer air and increased humidity are coming, making it feel a little more muggy.{/p}{p}Our Next Weather Maker is pushing through the Eastern Rockies today. We won't see that until we're getting into the weekend forecast. Showers and thunderstorms are what this will bring to Central Illinois, but we're not expecting any severe weather with this. Storms will mainly bring brief heavy rain and gusty winds.  We'll see the storm activity on Saturday, but I think we get a little break on Sunday.{/p}{p}High temperatures return to the low 80s starting on Sunday and then we'll warm up around the mid 80s for our first week of June. With the humidity coming in, these temperatures will feel like we're around the low 90s. Showers and thunderstorms look like they'll at least stick around through the midweek.{/p}{p}{strong}Darren Leeds - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}{a href=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\"}Click here for interactive radar{&nbsp;}{/a}{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Watch FOX-Illinois News weeknights at 5:30 and 9 pm on WCCU/WRSP FOX Illinois or at Foxillinois.com{br}{/strong}{/p}{h2}Have a great weather photo?

Yesterday was picture-perfect with low humidity and mild temperatures in the mid-70s. Not much is going to change for today's forecast. We will have another sunny start with temperatures in the low 50s. We will have another steady warm-up today with temperatures in the 70s for most of the afternoon with plenty of sunshine through the evening. Enjoy today because we will see major changes heading our way by the weekend.{/p}{p}Friday looks great, just a few degrees warmer than Thursday and a mix of sun and clouds. The big changes in our weather pattern will move in starting Friday night. We can expect the overcast conditions to turn to rain chances through the morning on Saturday. We might see a lull in the rain around midday, but another round of showers and a few thunderstorms are expected through the afternoon. We could see anywhere from a quarter to a half inch of rain through Saturday evening before things start drying out.{/p}{p}Sunday is looking a touch warmer in the low 80s with partly cloudy skies. An unsettled weather pattern will move in and linger through the middle of next week. Rain and some storm chances will persist through Wednesday with temperatures hanging around the mid-80s through next weekend.{/p}{p}{strong}Nick Patrick - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Don't forget to use our interactive radar when active weather strikes Central Illinois.{/strong}{br}{/p}{p}{strong}Have a great weather photo?

Dry for the remainder of the day. {strong}High{/strong}: 81 {strong}Low{/strong}: 65{/p}{p}Our weather pattern has been very pleasant as of late.  Temperatures have been mild and we've been soaking in the sunshine. We've got more of the same for the rest of the work week with a gradual warming trend.  High pressure is in place and has brought the drier air into the region. That is responsible for the refreshing feel we can detect while being outdoors. However, the start of June will bring some changes. Warmer air and increased humidity are coming, making it feel a little more muggy.{/p}{p}Our Next Weather Maker is pushing through the Eastern Rockies today. We won't see that until we're getting into the weekend forecast. Showers and thunderstorms are what this will bring to Central Illinois, but we're not expecting any severe weather with this. Storms will mainly bring brief heavy rain and gusty winds.  We'll see the storm activity on Saturday, but I think we get a little break on Sunday.{/p}{p}High temperatures return to the low 80s starting on Sunday and then we'll warm up around the mid 80s for our first week of June. With the humidity coming in, these temperatures will feel like we're around the low 90s. Showers and thunderstorms look like they'll at least stick around through the midweek.{/p}{p}{strong}Darren Leeds - Storm Team Meteorologist{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}{a href=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://foxillinois.com/weather/radar\"}Click here for interactive radar{&nbsp;}{/a}{/strong}{/p}{p}{strong}Watch FOX-Illinois News weeknights at 5:30 and 9 pm on WCCU/WRSP FOX Illinois or at Foxillinois.com{br}{/strong}{/p}{h2}Have a great weather photo?

powertrain.</p><p>That powertrain debuted in this year&#x27;s XC90 crossover, which shares Volvo&#x27;s Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform with the S90.</p><p>The S90 was unveiled in Sweden earlier this month.</p><p><strong>DON&#x27;T MISS: <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096866_2016-volvo-xc90-t8-plug-in-hybrid-twin-engine-first-drive" target="_blank"

model--at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show next month, Volvo says.</p><p>The &quot;Twin Engine&quot; powertrain includes a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine from <a

forms of forced induction.</p><p><br/></p><p>A supercharger is used to boost power at the bottom end of the rev range, while a turbocharger takes over at higher revs, once it&#x27;s built up enough boost.</p><p>The gasoline portion of the powertrain works with a rear-mounted 60-kilowatt (82-horsepower) electric motor, powered by a 9.2-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack.<br/></p><p>In the XC90, this combination is good for a combined 400 horsepower and 472 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>Volvo says it will do 0 to 62 mph in 5.6 seconds. Electric range is estimated at 35 miles on the rather optimistic European testing cycle.</p><p><strong>ALSO SEE: <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1095824_2016-volvo-xc90-t8-twin-engine-plug-in-hybrid-now-we-have-specs" target="_blank" class="themeColorForLinks">2016 Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid: Now We Have Specs</a> (Dec 2014)</strong></p><p>Both performance and efficiency figures should improve with the S90, given the sedan&#x27;s likely lower curb weight and better aerodynamic properties.</p><p>In addition to the plug-in hybrid powertrain, the S90 will be offered with as a T5 with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, and a T6 with a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged engine.</p><p><br/></p><p>While the T8 model will be all-wheel drive, other models will likely be front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive optional.</p><p>In addition to a platform and plug-in hybrid option, the S90 borrows quite a few styling features from the XC90.<br/></p><p>That includes a minimalist exterior with a large rectangular grille, and an interior with portrait-layout touchscreen.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1100486_volvo-to-sell-electric-car-by-2019-more-plug-in-hybrids-before-that" target="_blank" class="themeColorForLinks">Volvo To Sell Electric Car By 2019, More Plug-In Hybrids Before That</a></strong></p><p>The S90 will also be offered with Volvo&#x27;s Pilot Assist semi-autonomous technology.
