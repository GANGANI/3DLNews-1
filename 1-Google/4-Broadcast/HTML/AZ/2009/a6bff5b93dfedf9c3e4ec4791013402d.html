Cunningham is a television host, journalist, reporter, producer, and content creator. He's one of the most motivated, energetic, determined, and personable individuals you will ever meet, with a love and passion for journalism and storytelling.\n\nDarrell was born and raised in Pensacola, Florida. He is a first-generation college student. He earned a bachelor of science degree in communications from Florida State University, a master of arts degree in new media journalism from Full Sail University, and a master of science degree in broadcast and digital journalism from Syracuse University. \n\nDarrell has hosted, anchored, reported, and produced live news and lifestyle-driven shows in his previous roles. Darrell started his career at WFSU public media in Tallahassee, Florida. He went on to report for ESPNU, the first-in-the-nation primary \"New Hampshire Primary 2020,\" and on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, reporting on national enterprise stories with local ties to Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama, for WKRG-TV.\n\nNo journey in life is easy, but everything that Darrell has experienced has led him to this present moment being a part of Arizona's Family. His life motto is \"NEVER GIVE UP.\" Those are not just words to him but rather his lifestyle.\n\nWhen he is not at work, he enjoys time with his gentle giant Great Dane Thanos, volunteering at community events, exploring Arizona, traveling, gaming, and FaceTiming his family and friends on the East Coast.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"expertise":"lifestyle","last_updated_date":"2022-12-14T22:30:26.636Z","custom_gray_stationname":"kpho","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"marketing","type":"author","twitter":"TheDarrellShow_","instagram":"TheDarrellShow"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T18:29:02.105Z","description":{"basic":"Remodel

This means that forecast weather conditions combined with existing ozone levels are expected to result in local maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations that pose a health risk. Adverse health effects increase as air quality deteriorates.  Ozone is an air contaminant which can cause breathing difficulties for children, older adults, as well as persons with respiratory problems. A decrease in physical activity is recommended.  You are urged to car pool, telecommute or use mass transit. The use of gasoline-powered equipment should be reduced or done late in the day.
