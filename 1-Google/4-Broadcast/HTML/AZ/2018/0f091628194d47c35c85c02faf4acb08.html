		<p><strong>Rattlesnake Fire Update, Wednesday, May 2, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>Winter Precipitation Blankets Rattlesnake</strong></p>
<p>Location: Southeast of Whiteriver, AZ<br />
Cause: Human caused-under investigation<br />
Percent containment: 82%<br />
Start date: Wednesday 4-11-2018<br />
Size: 26,072 acres<br />
Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and grass understory<br />
Resources: 240 Personnel<br />
Fire activity: Fire behavior was moderate yesterday as crews continued to monitor and patrol containment lines on the western, northern, and southern flanks of the fire. Containment on the Rattlesnake Fire increased considerably as fire lines were tested and successfully held despite high winds. There are a few areas along the eastern side of the fire that are putting up minimal smoke. Remaining fire activity is well within the interior of control lines.<br />
Weather: Snow impacted the fire overnight with accumulations of approximately three inches. Today there is a 40% chance of snow in the area with winds gusts forecast up to 31mph. The cold front that started last evening is expected to bring more precipitation to the area through Thursday.<br />
Safety: Residents are reminded to drive with caution in the fire area due to potential smoke impacts on highway 191, and to be alert for fire traffic.<br />
Road and area closures: Forest Road 25 remains closed along with additional closures on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, the San Carlos Apache Reservation, and the White Mountain Apache Reservation. Visit the Rattlesnake Fire Inciweb page for a map and details.<br />
Fire restrictions: The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests is currently in Stage 1 Fire Restrictions in order to reduce human-caused fires and protect public safety. San Carlos Apache Reservation implemented Stage 2 Fire Restrictions on April 17, 2018. Modified Stage 2 Fire Restrictions continue on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.<br />

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Fire activity</strong>:  On Tuesday burnout operations were completed along Forest Road 25 and the section of control line adjacent to Highway 191. Stands of mixed conifer are burning with greater intensity due to dry and locally windy weather conditions. The fire burned into a mixed conifer stand adjacent to Forest Road 25 causing spot fires across the control line. Crews continue working the spot fires to contain them. Fire managers plan on continuing burnout operations for the Rattlesnake Fire removing ground fuels adjacent to the control lines. Initial attack resources remain at the ready for immediate response.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong>  ADOT personnel are in position to implement safety measures if the highway is affected by smoke and fire. Expected fire activities adjacent to Highway 191 and smoke from burnout operations have increased traffic congestion and reduced visibility. For public and firefighter safety motorists will be escorted on Highway 191 from Hannagan Meadows to the north and Stray Horse to the south for approximately 8 miles.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>:  Warming trends continue to bring higher daytime temps, dryer relative humidity and light winds from the west. Up slope winds in the afternoon may increase fire activity.  We expect smoke to drift to the east then potentially shift and settle into Eagle Creek, Blue River and San Francisco upper Gila River valleys overnight.  Valley smoke should lift by 9a.m.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Values</strong>:  Resource advisors deployed on the Rattlesnake Fire are identifying values at risk so that firefighters can employ tactics to reduce impacts to threatened and endangered species and their habitat due to fire suppression activities.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Road and Area Closures</strong>:  Closures are in place on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, White Mountain Apache Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  They are being adjusted based on fire activity. Visit the Rattlesnake Fire Inciweb page for details.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Fire Restrictions:  </strong>Monday the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests entered into Stage 1 Fire Restrictions in order to reduce human-caused fires and protect public safety.  San Carlos Apache Reservation implemented Stage 2 Fire Restrictions on April 17, 2018.  Modified Stage 2 Fire Restrictions continue on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.</p>

Rattlesnake Fire Update, Tuesday, April 24, 2018
Burnout Activities Increase Smoke Visibility
Location: Southeast of Whiteriver, AZ
Cause: Human Caused-under investigation
Percent containment: 25%
Start date: Wednesday, April 11, 2018
Size: 19,049 acres
Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and grass understory
Resources: Approximately 544 personnel
Fire activity: The Rattlesnake Fire put up more smoke today due to tactical ground firing operations and planned aerial ignitions that helped to consume unburned fuels and strengthen control lines. Firefighters plan on completing the last mile or so of firing along the edge of Road 25 east to the junction with Highway191. When weather and operational progress dictate, tactical firing operations will continue from Highway 191 west along the southern edge of the Bear Wallow Wilderness to join up with firefighters burning out coming from the west. Fire crews supporting the firing operation worked to secure the edge of their control lines and mopped up hot spots. Mop up and fire line suppression repair will continue over the next several days. Initial attack resources remain at the ready for immediate response.
Safety: Motorists should be prepared again for possible delays due to pilot cars and/or a temporary road closure as firefighters conduct burnout operations along Forest Road 25 and the 309 Trail up to Highway 191. Timing of the firing operations, scheduled for early this morning, will be dictated by safety, weather, and operational progress. ADOT personnel are in position to implement safety measures if and when the highway is affected by smoke and fire. Checkpoints will be located at Hannagan Meadow to the north and Stray Horse to the south on Highway 191.
Weather: A warming trend continues to bring higher daytime temps, dryer relative humidity and light winds from the west. No significant wind events are forecast for the next several days. We expect smoke to drift to the east then shift and settle into Eagle Creek, Blue River and San Francisco upper Gila River valleys overnight. On Tuesday valley smoke should lift out by 9a.m., and drift to the east throughout the day then shift and settle to the south. The heaviest smoke impacts will peak from 3-5p.m. over the next few days on highway 191 between mile markers 226 north to 245, visibility could be limited to 1.5 miles.
Values: Resource advisors deployed on the Rattlesnake Fire are identifying values at risk so that firefighters can employ tactics to reduce impacts to threatened and endangered species and their habitat because of fire suppression activities.
Closures: Closures are in place on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, White Mountain Apache Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. Visit the Rattlesnake Fire Inciweb page for details.
Restrictions: Monday the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests entered into Stage 1 Fire Restrictions in order to reduce human-caused fires and protect public safety. San Carlos Apache Reservation implemented Stage 2 Fire Restrictions on April 17, 2018. Modified Stage 2 Fire Restrictions continue on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.

Rattlesnake Fire Update, Friday, April 20, 2018
Containment Increases Despite High Winds
Location: Southeast of Whiteriver, AZ
Cause: Human Caused-under investigation
Percent containment: 20%
Start date: Wednesday, April 11, 2018
Size: 12,797 acres
Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and grass understory
Resources: Approximately 456 personnel
Public Meeting: There was a community meeting in Alpine last night at the Alpine Community Center where concerned citizens gathered to hear updates from agency leaders and the fire team, and it was well attended.
Fire activity: There is no updated acreage due to the windy conditions yesterday that prevented the infrared flight overnight. There was minimal growth on the southwest and southeastern flanks, and was comprised of low intensity ground fire and small clumps of trees burning. The fire did not make any more advances towards the communities of Alpine, Nutrioso or Round Valley, or cross any containment lines to the north. Active fire continued on the eastern edge near the 25 road, and on the northeast side of Reno lookout. Significant progress was made on fire line construction to the south along the Bear Wallow Wilderness boundary. Fire crews are tentatively planning a burnout operation, when weather conditions permit, to tie fire control lines into highway 191, east of the Rattlesnake fire. This potential may result in a temporary closure of highway 191, however, the public will be given notice of detour route(s) and road information will be posted on all of the fire information websites, social media and roadside signs.
Values &amp; Objectives: Rattlesnake Fire suppression objectives include the completion of fire line around the entire perimeter, however all fire actions are assessed in relation to protecting values and minimizing impacts on cultural resources, wildlife, wilderness, watersheds, recreation areas, and natural resources.
Safety: Forest visitors are reminded to use caution when traveling along highway 191 and surrounding forest roads as smoke may reduce visibility in the area. There is also a large amount of emergency vehicle traffic in the vicinity of the fire, so please proceed with caution when traveling in the area.
Weather: The Red Flag Warning that was issued yesterday has expired and the weather outlook is predicting a dramatic change over the next few days. Today’s forecast is calling for much cooler daytime highs in the upper forties to low fifties, with lighter winds out of the west and relative humidity in the 35-45% range. This evening there is a 20% chance of precipitation, some of which may be in the form of snow. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality monitor is up and running at the Alpine Fire Station, and air quality information can be found at https://www.phoenixvis.net/PPMmain.aspx.
Closures: Closures are in place on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, White Mountain Apache Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. Visit the Rattlesnake Fire Inciweb page for details.
Restrictions: San Carlos Apache Reservation implemented Stage 2 Fire Restrictions on April 17, 2018. Modified Stage 2 Fire Restrictions continue on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Campfires will
Rattlesnake Fire Update, Thursday, April 19, 2018
Containment increases as weather cooperates
Location: Southeast of Whiteriver, AZ
Cause: Human Caused-under investigation
Percent containment: 15%
Start date: Wednesday, April 11, 2018
Size: 12,797 acres
Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and grass understory
Resources: Approximately 408 personnel
Public Meeting: There will be a community meeting in Alpine tonight, April 19, 2018, at 6:00 pm at the Alpine Community Center, located at 12 County Road 2061, Alpine, AZ 85920.
Fire activity: The majority of new growth on the Rattlesnake Fire occurred within the interior of the fire and to the south and southeast portions of the fire where aerial retardant drops were used yesterday to slow the spread. Despite additional acreage, the fire has not advanced towards the communities of Alpine, Nutrioso or Round Valley, or crossed any containment lines to the north and east. One of the primary areas of concern today is the fire advancement on the northeast side of Reno lookout. Crews will continue to work south while scouting potential fire line on the southeast and southwest sides to keep the fire within the area previously burned by the Wallow Fire. Fire crews are tentatively planning a burnout operation, when weather conditions permit, to tie fire control lines into highway 191, east of the Rattlesnake fire. This potential may result in a temporary closure of highway 191, however, the public will be given notice of detour route(s) and road information will be posted on all of the fire information websites and social media.
Safety: Forest visitors are reminded to use caution when traveling along highway 191 and surrounding forest roads as smoke may reduce visibility in the area, and there is increased emergency vehicle traffic.
Weather: The National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag Warning for today April 19 for portions of eastern Arizona due to strong winds and low relative humidity, and smoke may impact the community of Alpine today. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality placed an air quality monitor at the Alpine Fire Station yesterday, and it is currently operational. Air quality information can be found at https://www.phoenixvis.net/PPMmain.aspx.
Closures: Closures are in place on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, White Mountain Apache Reservation and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. Visit the Rattlesnake Fire Inciweb page for details.

Rattlesnake Fire Update, Wednesday, April 18, 2018
Crews make progress despite winds
Location: Southeast of Whiteriver, AZ
Cause: Human Caused-under investigation
Percent containment: 5%
Start date: Wednesday, April 11, 2018
Size: 11,339 acres
Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and grass understory
Resources: Approximately 276 personnel
Public Meeting: There will be a community meeting in Alpine on Thursday night, April 19, 2018, at 6:00 pm, which be held at the Alpine Community Center, located at 12 County Road 2061, Alpine, AZ 85920.

These two storms may limit the ability to utilize air tankers and helicopters, and cause dead standing snags to fall over which is a safety concern for firefighters working in the area. The amount of moisture in the grasses and logs are at record lows. These conditions are historically seen during June, causing fire managers to carefully assess where to place fire crews as the storms pass through the area. Crews have been working to secure line up through the Black River corridor, building a “catchers mitt” of containment line along Forest Road 25I. Firefighting resources are also being mobilized to the southeast side of the fire, where they will begin improving fire lines used during the Wallow Fire.
Closures: The closure order on the Alpine Ranger District of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest has been expanded to include all of the Bear Wallow Wilderness and areas south and west of Forest Road 25. Several roads on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation within the boundary of the Rattlesnake Fire will be closed: The Y79 road at the Y40 Junction and the 25F road at the Y40 junction. Please drive carefully and turn on headlights if traveling on the Y40 road.
Restrictions: Modified Stage 2 Fire Restrictions continue on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Campfires will NOT be allowed during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and debris burning is prohibited until further notice.
Anyone having information regarding how the Rattlesnake Fire started is asked to contact WE-TIP at 1-800-47ARSON (1- 800-472-7766).
