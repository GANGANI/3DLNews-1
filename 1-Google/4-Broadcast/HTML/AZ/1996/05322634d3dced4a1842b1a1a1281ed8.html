It’s mutual, then. I have a summary here of your findings. Let me just run through a couple bullet points and then you can take it and expand on this. ‘The current proposals being discussed in Washington, House and Senate, would raise the total federal government expenditures by 5.6% more than otherwise, adding $285.6 billion to the deficit in 2019, would increase national health care spenders by an additional 8.9%. After all this, it would still leave 30 million Americans uninsured.’ Fill in the blanks here for us.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp>LAFFER: Well, you know, it’s a fairly straightforward thing. Without going through the specific numbers — although I’d be more than happy to do that — you know, whenever you separate people from the purchases they make… If you walked into a store and weren’t told what anything cost and you could pick out whatever you wanted free, you’re going to be squanders, you’re going to buy things that are way too expensive that you don’t want. I mean, one of the ways controlling costs is making people responsible for their own money, for their own expenditures and that is exactly what this program does not do. It makes the separation between the patient and the doctor and health services further and further removed, and takes away all control of costs. And, frankly, as P.J. O’Rourke put it, he said, ‘If you think health care is expensive now, just wait ’til you see how much it costs when it’s free,’ and that’s exactly what we’re doing here.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushlimbaugh.com%2Fdaily%2F2009%2F08%2F04%2Frush_interviews_dr_arthur_laffer%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CMarkWeiner%40iheartmedia.com%7Cb3988143867741c9dc6808d9dd15402e%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C637783905642942759%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=ueT%2BYkShgpasYIUVgudA1sD2ZmuMa1nPzQi1cYXCNBA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2009/08/04/rush_interviews_dr_arthur_laffer/\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp> \u003c/p> Learn more about your ad-choices at \u003ca href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\u003c/a>\u003cp>See \u003ca href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a> for privacy information.\u003c/p>","startDate":1642794049000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvY2xpcHMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzA0N2M1Y2NkLTYxMmYtNDg1MS05ZTIxLWFlMzkwMDgxNmY1NS9lZTFkYWQ0ZS1mMjVlLTRkY2EtOGNhOC1hZTM5MDA4MTdjMzYvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY0NDU2NTg5MCZzaXplPUxhcmdl"},{"id":91844740,"podcastId":19001275,"podcastSlug":"57-rush-limbaugh-timeless-wisd","title":"The Establishment Thinks They Have Their Power Back — But They Know It’s Tenuous","duration":1613,"isExplicit":false,"description":"\u003cp>RUSH: Greetings to you, music lovers, thrill-seekers, conversationalists all across the fruited plain.

That happens to be the soap opera story. Actually, it’s not the soap opera story. This is Putin running rings around us. There’s no question what’s going on here. Vladimir Putin’s reassembling the Soviet Union. And this is something — I’ve got the sound bite — I predicted this back in 2008. And all the smart money in Washington, inside the Beltway — we’ve got these sound bites, too — they’re shocked that Putin is trying to reassemble the Soviet Union. They can’t believe it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even Lurch — this guy, John Kerry, is shocked that Putin is actually conducting a ground war. Listen to this. Grab number 17. Let’s just get this out of the way ’cause I think it’s hilarious and it is indicative of how just outclassed we are. We’re clueless. This generation of leaders is literally clueless about our enemies. Remember something you were taught early on in this program. The purpose of any military is to kill people and break things. It’s not to advance anybody’s social agenda. It’s not a laboratory for the left’s social ideas or playgrounds. It is to kill people and break things, and the second rule is that the aggressor in any conflict sets the rules. And if they violate an existing rule book, then so be it. The aggressor sets the rules, and right now, Putin is setting the rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp>I went back and did some research. In 1979 when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, ’79, ’80, they did it at Christmastime, when we were all distracted. Putin goes into Ukraine, after, by the way, colonizing Georgia. They got Georgia back now. Remember Shalikashvili and South Ossetia? Well, they got Georgia back and they’re marching now. And when did Putin do it? He sent the troops in during the Olympics that he hosted, that NBC televised and the world was watching. And then after that he continued this buildup last night during the Oscars. That is strategy. What it means to me is, in just that regard, if Putin actually made strategic decisions based on the American people being distracted it tells me that Putin believes that American public opinion still matters, in terms of impacting American leadership.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003cbr>\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushlimbaugh.com%2Fdaily%2F2014%2F03%2F03%2Fclueless_american_leaders_shocked_by_putin_s_attempt_to_reassemble_soviet_union%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7CMarkWeiner%40iheartmedia.com%7C2e1a0e670c1547705ef408d9d52f5971%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C637775221695879527%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=Dfe331wP3govWCoUzV9CkkNCQzCIBzXT8azJgH4MMiI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/03/03/clueless_american_leaders_shocked_by_putin_s_attempt_to_reassemble_soviet_union/\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp> \u003c/p> Learn more about your ad-choices at \u003ca href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\u003c/a>\u003cp>See \u003ca href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener\u003c/a> for privacy information.\u003c/p>","startDate":1641931380000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvY2xpcHMvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzA0N2M1Y2NkLTYxMmYtNDg1MS05ZTIxLWFlMzkwMDgxNmY1NS9lYzQ0MTY5OS0zYjFiLTQ3ZWItYTgzYy1hZTM5MDA4MzRhNTAvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTY0NDU2NjI4NiZzaXplPUxhcmdl"},{"id":91412638,"podcastId":19001275,"podcastSlug":"57-rush-limbaugh-timeless-wisd","title":"I’ve Been Properly Credited for Coining the Term “Undocumented Democrats”","duration":602,"isExplicit":false,"description":"\u003cp>RUSH: The Weekly Standard has a piece in it that, very, very rarely has this ever happened to me.
