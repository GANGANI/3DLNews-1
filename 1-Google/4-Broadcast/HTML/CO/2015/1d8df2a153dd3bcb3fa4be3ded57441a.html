CPR stuck out to me because of the news team's commitment to local issues, the state-of-the-art facilities, and the fact that there is a lot of support for CPR in the community. It was an added bonus that Colorado offers a lot of options for the leisure activities my wife and I enjoy, including traveling, listening to live music and attending sporting events. Denver seemed like an ideal place for us, and I'm really happy to being a part of CPR's bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","meta":{"avatar_image_id":579431,"avatar_image_url":"https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/09/210901-BEN-MARKUS-STAFF-PHOTO-KEVINJBEATY-03-sq.jpg","email":"ben.markus@cpr.org","title":"Investigative Reporter","twitter":"CPRmarkus","facebook":"","instagram":""}},"8772":{"id":8772,"name":"Jenny Brundin","slug":"jenny-brundin","link":"https://www.cpr.org/author/jenny-brundin/","parent":0,"taxonomy":"author","short_bio":"","bio":"\u003cp\u003eJenny Brundin is the education reporter for Colorado Public Radio.

I think members of the press still occupy a unique and revered role in our society as members of the fourth estate. I'm proud to call myself a journalist, and I take the job seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I got into radio: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nI came to radio because I wanted to tell stories that touched people's lives, the way NPR so often touches mine. Like many listeners, I was glued to my radio following 9/11. Melissa Block's reporting at that time was part of what inspired me to become a reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I ended up at CPR: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nAfter living the island life in Hawaii for three years, I was ready to make a change. CPR stuck out to me because of the news team's commitment to local issues, the state-of-the-art facilities, and the fact that there is a lot of support for CPR in the community. It was an added bonus that Colorado offers a lot of options for the leisure activities my wife and I enjoy, including traveling, listening to live music and attending sporting events. Denver seemed like an ideal place for us, and I'm really happy to being a part of CPR's bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","meta":{"avatar_image_id":579431,"avatar_image_url":"https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/09/210901-BEN-MARKUS-STAFF-PHOTO-KEVINJBEATY-03-sq.jpg","email":"ben.markus@cpr.org","title":"Investigative Reporter","twitter":"CPRmarkus","facebook":"","instagram":""}},"10741":{"id":10741,"name":"Montezuma County","slug":"montezuma-county","link":"https://www.cpr.org/tag/montezuma-county/","parent":0,"taxonomy":"post_tag"},"10871":{"id":10871,"name":"Outdoors","slug":"outdoors","link":"https://www.cpr.org/category/environment/outdoors/","parent":10,"taxonomy":"category"},"11060":{"id":11060,"name":"Andrew Kenney","slug":"andy-kenney","link":"https://www.cpr.org/author/andy-kenney/","parent":0,"taxonomy":"author","short_bio":"","bio":"\u003cp\u003eAndrew Kenney has worked as a Public Affairs reporter for Colorado Public Radio since 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfessional Background:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nAndrew previously worked at The Denver Post, Denverite and The (Raleigh) News \u0026amp; Observer, covering towns, cities, states and people.

It was an added bonus that Colorado offers a lot of options for the leisure activities my wife and I enjoy, including traveling, listening to live music and attending sporting events.

I think members of the press still occupy a unique and revered role in our society as members of the fourth estate. I'm proud to call myself a journalist, and I take the job seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I got into radio: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nI came to radio because I wanted to tell stories that touched people's lives, the way NPR so often touches mine. Like many listeners, I was glued to my radio following 9/11. Melissa Block's reporting at that time was part of what inspired me to become a reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I ended up at CPR: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nAfter living the island life in Hawaii for three years, I was ready to make a change. CPR stuck out to me because of the news team's commitment to local issues, the state-of-the-art facilities, and the fact that there is a lot of support for CPR in the community. It was an added bonus that Colorado offers a lot of options for the leisure activities my wife and I enjoy, including traveling, listening to live music and attending sporting events. Denver seemed like an ideal place for us, and I'm really happy to being a part of CPR's bright future.\u003c/p\u003e\n","meta":{"avatar_image_id":579431,"avatar_image_url":"https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/09/210901-BEN-MARKUS-STAFF-PHOTO-KEVINJBEATY-03-sq.jpg","email":"ben.markus@cpr.org","title":"Investigative Reporter","twitter":"CPRmarkus","facebook":"","instagram":""}},"10741":{"id":10741,"name":"Montezuma County","slug":"montezuma-county","link":"https://www.cpr.org/tag/montezuma-county/","parent":0,"taxonomy":"post_tag"},"10871":{"id":10871,"name":"Outdoors","slug":"outdoors","link":"https://www.cpr.org/category/environment/outdoors/","parent":10,"taxonomy":"category"},"11060":{"id":11060,"name":"Andrew Kenney","slug":"andy-kenney","link":"https://www.cpr.org/author/andy-kenney/","parent":0,"taxonomy":"author","short_bio":"","bio":"\u003cp\u003eAndrew Kenney has worked as a Public Affairs reporter for Colorado Public Radio since 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfessional Background:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nAndrew previously worked at The Denver Post, Denverite and The (Raleigh) News \u0026amp; Observer, covering towns, cities, states and people.
