(WNEM)</b> - Saginaw Township Police Officer Jeff Koenig has been released from the hospital and is now recovering at home after being shot on Jan. 22.</p><p class="text | article-text">Koenig was performing a traffic stop about 2 a.m. on Tittabawassee Road near Bay Road in Kochville Township when he was shot in the jaw and the right shoulder area.</p><p class="text | article-text">“When he approached the vehicle the suspect immediately fired several rounds at him, striking him,” Shiawassee County Sheriff Brian BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Joshua Rosebush, 29, of Vassar, is accused of shooting Koenig.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“Oh, it’s just sickening. It’s just terrible to have that phone call during the middle of the night knowing that one of your officers was gravely wounded,” Saginaw Township Police Chief Donald Pussehl said.</p><p class="text | article-text">After the shooting, the suspect left the scene, sparking a manhunt that spanned several counties.</p><p class="text | article-text">Koenig, a 16-year veteran of the Saginaw Township Police Department, was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Police said his condition stabilized about 4:30 a.m. that day.</p><p class="text | article-text">Koenig was transferred to the University of Michigan hospital where he underwent multiple surgeries.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“Initially we didn’t know which way it was going to go,” Pussehl said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Pussehl said doctors want Koenig to focus on recovery.</p><p class="text | article-text">Koenig has since been released from the hospital and has a long road to recovery, Pussehl said on Feb. 5.</p><p class="text | article-text">“He’s still in quite a bit of pain and having difficulty sleeping at times. And this whole incident, as you can imagine, has been very overwhelming to him as he works through this process,” Pussehl said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Pussehl said Koenig is asking for privacy and for no visitors while he recovers. He will need additional surgeries.</p><p class="text | article-text">Koenig’s jaw is still wired shut, but he is aware of what happened to him, Pussehl said.</p><p class="text | article-text">He said it could be months before Koenig is ready to have reconstructive surgery on his jaw.</p><p class="text | article-text">Pussehl said Koenig’s family can’t thank everyone enough for their well wishes and good deeds.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“From what my officers tell me, speaking with his mother, she’s very, very appreciative for the support that has been shown to her son in his time of need and then also to the family,” Pussehl said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Saginaw County said it will handle the prosecution of the entire case.</p><p class="text | article-text"><b>The manhunt for suspect Rosebush</b></p><p class="text | article-text">Shortly after the shooting, law enforcement officers found a truck, believed to have been the one Rosebush was in at the time of the shooting, in the area of Liberty Road in Kochville Township. Kaiser said the truck was stolen from Saginaw County and then left on Liberty Road between Michigan Avenue and Davis Road.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div><div data-oembed-type="youtube" class="oembed | article-oembed w-100 oembed-youtube d-flex justify-content-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdi0hVEQHtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p class="text | article-text">Michigan State Police confirm the suspect wanted for shooting a Saginaw Township police officer early Tuesday morning is in custody.</p><p class="text | article-text">Police said Rosebush then stole another vehicle and dumped it in Flint at the Home Depot on Corunna Road. That vehicle was a stolen, white, 2013 Ford F-250 Super duty, with license plate DB60703.</p><p class="text | article-text">“First, our thoughts and prayers are with the wounded officer and his family. &nbsp;We are glad law enforcement was able to apprehend the suspect,” said David Riccius, CFO of AIS Construction Equipment Corporation.”Second, the minute AIS learned of the unfortunate incident with the officer and our stolen truck, we offered full cooperation including taking our entire fleet of trucks off the road in order to assist law enforcement in identifying and capturing the suspect.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Investigators spotted Rosebush in another stolen vehicle about 1 p.m. on I-69 in Shiawassee County.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Michigan State Police said Rosebush stopped his vehicle, got out, assumed a shooting stance, and pointed a gun at a detective, prompting the detective to fire. That’s when Rosebush was shot in the jaw, and police were able to take him into custody.</p><p class="text | article-text">“To know that he took the courageous steps to overcome and stop him before he could hurt someone else, it’s a great feeling,” BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">BeGole said there was a short chase before Rosebush was taken into custody, and he was caught in the middle of the street.</p><p class="text | article-text">No officers were hurt.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“We are thankful officers were able to get him off the streets and no one else was hurt,” BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">The Shiawassee County detective is on paid leave after the traumatic conclusion.</p><p class="text | article-text">The Shiawassee County Sheriff’s detective who shot Rosebush is on paid leave.</p><p class="text | article-text">“You’re talking about a 30-year deputy who is now a detective and one of the finest in this department,” BeGole said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">That detective is being called a hero by the community and law enforcement.</p><p class="text | article-text">“If I could speak about the pride that I have as a sheriff for the actions he took,” BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">The officer has since been identified as Det. Lt. Scott Shenk.</p><p class="text | article-text">BeGole said the detective was trailing the suspect when Rosebush pulled into a driveway and got out of the vehicle he was driving. The detective was alone and still waiting for backup.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“If you get in a circumstance like this you can play it back-and-forth in your mind all day, but until it happens one might not know how you’re going to react. You have to rely on your training and that’s what that detective did that day,” BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">BeGole said Shenk is anxious to return to work.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Very appreciative of how he’s been treated, almost like a hero in Shiawassee County. Because he showed such courageous bravery in apprehending him,” BeGole said.</p><p class="text | article-text">BeGole said Shenk should be back on duty soon.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">On Feb. 14, Saginaw County Prosecutor John McColgan ruled Shenk was justified in his use of deadly force against Rosebush.</p><p class="text | article-text">Rosebush has been released from the hospital and is in prison. He was arraigned on 26 felony charges on Feb. 5.</p><p class="text | article-text">Investigators initially believed someone gave Rosebush a ride to Genesee County while the manhunt was underway. Now they are saying that did not happen and he acted alone.</p><p class="text | article-text"><b>Gun used in shooting was stolen</b></p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The gun police confiscated from Rosebush was stolen in Clare County, Kaiser said.</p><p class="text | article-text">The gun was in a dark-colored Suburban that was stolen from a store in Farwell at 6 p.m. on Jan. 4., according to the Clare County undersheriff. He said a man went into the store and left his vehicle running and unlocked.</p><p class="text | article-text">That vehicle was recovered in Flint Township on Jan. 8.</p><p class="text | article-text"><b>Rosebush has a lengthy criminal history</b></p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div><div data-oembed-type="youtube" class="oembed | article-oembed w-100 oembed-youtube d-flex justify-content-center embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FmO5_Qjo-Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p class="text | article-text">The 29-year-old has several prior convictions including multiple incidents of assaulting an officer.</p><p class="text | article-text">According to the Michigan Department of Corrections, Rosebush has a history of assaulting or obstructing a public officer, among other things. He has been in and out of the criminal justice system since he was a teenager.</p><p class="text | article-text">Rosebush absconded from his parole in early January.</p><p class="text | article-text">He was charged with three counts of breaking and entering in 2006.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">In 2012 and 2016, he was charged with resisting or assaulting an officer.</p><p class="text | article-text">Rosebush also has multiple charges when it comes to breaking into cars and stealing credit cards.</p><p class="text | article-text">Vassar police said Rosebush was a suspect in a string of 10 vehicle break-ins earlier this month. They began looking for him during the investigation of two vehicle thefts, saying he had removed his tether.</p><p class="text | article-text">Chief Don Pussehl said this may have been the first time an officer in his department was shot during a traffic stop.
