She received the MAB Best In Weather award  in 2018, 2019 and 2021.\n\nShe returned to the Upper Peninsula in 2018 after spending some time in tornado alley as a weekend meteorologist for the KSPR Weather Team in Springfield, Missouri. Hint-she loves severe weather. Jennifer was born in Puerto Rico but raised in sunny Florida. Growing up in Florida she loved watching thunderstorms in the summer. After touring the weather department at WJXT, her local news station in Jacksonville, Florida, she realized her future was in Meteorology.\n\nIn 2011, she graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Arts in broadcast journalism and a minor in theater.\nJennifer started her career on the shores of Lake Superior in 2012 at WLUC-TV6 in Marquette, Michigan as a news reporter. During her time as a reporter and fill-in anchor here she traveled across the entire U.P. to cover stories including the 2012 elections and the evolution of Duke LifePoint with U.P. Health System. In 2015, her mini-series on medical marijuana won an award from the Michigan Association of Broadcasters. During this, she worked towards a degree in meteorology.\n\nAfter three years of reporting, she started her weather career as a forecaster at WILX News 10 in Lansing, Michigan. She then graduated in May of 2016 from Mississippi State University with a Bachelor of Science in broadcast meteorology. To continue her education she earned the National Weather Association Seal of Approval in November of 2020.\n\nJennifer enjoys hiking, exploring, spending time on the lake, and attending plays. Jennifer is excited to be back on the shores of Lake Superior. Interesting tidbits: she’s fluent in Spanish, a huge Disney fanatic, and loves chicken wings (all the chicken wings)!!

During this time at the radio station, he was on air every Tuesday and Thursday for a sports talk show. He also worked with a station called LISD-Tv where he covered college and high school sports in the area. \n \nWhen it comes to extracurricular activities Tristen enjoys things such as working out, bowling, go-kart racing, hikes, swimming, traveling, and hanging out with friends.

His passion for meteorology and forecasting only grew deeper in time, leading to occasional \"vacations\" to go storm-chasing out in the Great Plains.

However, Cody is a proud Michigander, born and raised in the Lower Peninsula in Gladwin County and a 2014 graduate of Northern Michigan University.\n \nCody was the senior reporter and evening anchor at KBZK / KXLF in Bozeman, Montana’s News Leader. For nearly three years, he sat alongside journalism greats like Donna Kelley and Chet Layman at the anchor desk while also leading the helm in the field, covering a wide arrange of topics and accruing several top awards, including two E.B. Craney Awards for breaking and hard news coverage and being voted “Bozeman’s Best Anchor” alongside Donna and Chet in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, he also joined the list of journalists in the historical coverage of Ted Kaczinski, also known as “The Unabomber,” being the first reporter to interview Ed Sprout, the semi-truck driver who avoided 25-plus years of cameras after hauling the Unabomber’s cabin from Montana to California. Cody frequently donned wildland fire gear and orange vests in the Bozeman area, covering wildland fires that expanded to tens of thousands of acres of Montanan prairie and mountain landscape, including the Bridger Foothills Fire, which destroyed around 70 homes in early-September 2020. He was also recently awarded \"Bozeman's Best News Writer of 2022\" prior to his return to Upper Michigan in November 2021. While in Montana, Cody also volunteered as an exotic animal rehabilitator, rescuing reptiles and other \"unusual pets\" from poorly-maintained circumstances. He also frequented the backcountry trails of Yellowstone National Park. \n \nPrior to KBZK, Cody worked as a reporter and anchor at 9&10 News in Cadillac, MI, covering several counties and telling hundreds of stories across Michigan’s Northern Lower Peninsula. There, he was recognized with several Michigan Association of Broadcaster accolades for his coverage and attention to community life and events. One moment that he is proud of: meeting and interviewing \"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky following the death of hockey legend Gordie Howe. Cody followed the Presidential Election of 2016 closely, interviewing many of the candidates and attending dozens of presidential rallies. He also was among the team to report on-the-ground during the peak of the Flint Water Crisis, covering the impact in both the communities across Genesee County and animal shelters found to also be battling lead-contaminated water. In record, he is the first reporter to have been able to venture into and cover \"from the inside\" a Rainbow Family Gathering in Manistee County in 2015, traveling by way of potato truck deep into the Manistee National Forest in Wexford County. \n \nBack at NMU, Cody was swayed into journalism through the amazing opportunities at WNMU TV13’s “Public Eye News” and The North Wind campus newspaper, where he worked as an anchor/producer/director at PEN and, at The North Wind, the sports editor before becoming the editor-in-chief in 2014. He also produced and jockeyed a radio show on NMU's \"Radio X.\"\n \nAll of that aside, Cody was brought back to Northern Michigan for a primary reason: it’s home. Cody loves everything to do with U.P., from hiking and fishing to remembering jumping off of Black Rocks during his university years. He’s trading the Bridger Mountains of Gallatin County for Sugarloaf and Hogsback, knowing that while they may not be as tall that no other landscape in the world has Lake Superior as a backdrop. \n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wluc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-03-11T19:08:04.807Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"7"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T21:47:04.005Z","description":{"basic":"An April storm put Menominee County’s power grid to the test, knocking out power for more than 15,000 people.

However, Cody is a proud Michigander, born and raised in the Lower Peninsula in Gladwin County and a 2014 graduate of Northern Michigan University.\n \nCody was the senior reporter and evening anchor at KBZK / KXLF in Bozeman, Montana’s News Leader. For nearly three years, he sat alongside journalism greats like Donna Kelley and Chet Layman at the anchor desk while also leading the helm in the field, covering a wide arrange of topics and accruing several top awards, including two E.B. Craney Awards for breaking and hard news coverage and being voted “Bozeman’s Best Anchor” alongside Donna and Chet in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, he also joined the list of journalists in the historical coverage of Ted Kaczinski, also known as “The Unabomber,” being the first reporter to interview Ed Sprout, the semi-truck driver who avoided 25-plus years of cameras after hauling the Unabomber’s cabin from Montana to California. Cody frequently donned wildland fire gear and orange vests in the Bozeman area, covering wildland fires that expanded to tens of thousands of acres of Montanan prairie and mountain landscape, including the Bridger Foothills Fire, which destroyed around 70 homes in early-September 2020. He was also recently awarded \"Bozeman's Best News Writer of 2022\" prior to his return to Upper Michigan in November 2021. While in Montana, Cody also volunteered as an exotic animal rehabilitator, rescuing reptiles and other \"unusual pets\" from poorly-maintained circumstances. He also frequented the backcountry trails of Yellowstone National Park. \n \nPrior to KBZK, Cody worked as a reporter and anchor at 9&10 News in Cadillac, MI, covering several counties and telling hundreds of stories across Michigan’s Northern Lower Peninsula. There, he was recognized with several Michigan Association of Broadcaster accolades for his coverage and attention to community life and events. One moment that he is proud of: meeting and interviewing \"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky following the death of hockey legend Gordie Howe. Cody followed the Presidential Election of 2016 closely, interviewing many of the candidates and attending dozens of presidential rallies. He also was among the team to report on-the-ground during the peak of the Flint Water Crisis, covering the impact in both the communities across Genesee County and animal shelters found to also be battling lead-contaminated water. In record, he is the first reporter to have been able to venture into and cover \"from the inside\" a Rainbow Family Gathering in Manistee County in 2015, traveling by way of potato truck deep into the Manistee National Forest in Wexford County. \n \nBack at NMU, Cody was swayed into journalism through the amazing opportunities at WNMU TV13’s “Public Eye News” and The North Wind campus newspaper, where he worked as an anchor/producer/director at PEN and, at The North Wind, the sports editor before becoming the editor-in-chief in 2014. He also produced and jockeyed a radio show on NMU's \"Radio X.\"\n \nAll of that aside, Cody was brought back to Northern Michigan for a primary reason: it’s home. Cody loves everything to do with U.P., from hiking and fishing to remembering jumping off of Black Rocks during his university years. He’s trading the Bridger Mountains of Gallatin County for Sugarloaf and Hogsback, knowing that while they may not be as tall that no other landscape in the world has Lake Superior as a backdrop.
