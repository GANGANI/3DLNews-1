COUNTY -- Action News has learned that Benton County Sheriff Gerald D. Hatcher has been added to a dubious list of law enforcement officers who may not be considered trustworthy in a court of law.{/p}{p}Sheriff Hatcher was added to the 'Potential Impeachment Disclosure' list, (sometimes referred to as a Brady List), a couple weeks ago. The list of officers on that list is constantly monitored and updated by Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller and his team.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}Action News learned about Hatcher's name being added to the list by filing a Freedom of Information Act request to the Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Miller promptly obliged by sending the updated list to our newsroom.{/p}{p}Officers on that PID list have{&nbsp;} been found to be considered untrustworthy for a number of potential reasons.{&nbsp;}{a href=\"https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony\"}This new{&nbsp;}addition to the list comes days after the Washington Supreme Court issued its lengthy opinion on the recall of Sheriff Jerry Hatcher.{/a}{&nbsp;}In the court's opinion,{&nbsp;} the court makes a special note of an internal review document completed by Hatcher.{/p}{p}The Supreme Court Decision states:{&nbsp;}{/p}{blockquote}Sheriff Hatcher produced a letter dated February 14, 2020 to the Franklin County sheriff with a formal request to initiate an administrative review. However according to the{&nbsp;}metadata, the letter he produced was actually created on February 21, 2020. Sergeant Erickson alleges that Sheriff Hatcher violated RCW 40.16.020, which criminalizes &ldquo;falsify[ing] any record or paper appertaining to the officer&rsquo;s office.{br}{/blockquote}{blockquote}The voters could find that Sheriff Hatcher did falsify the letter when he dated it for a date prior to the actual date the file was created. Although Sheriff Hatcher claims that it was backdated to when he had the initial conversation, we do not weigh the evidence.{&nbsp;}{/blockquote}{blockquote}Further, this is not simply an act of changing a date. Sheriff Hatcher falsified the date on the administrative review of himself, which he sent to his political ally. This act, when viewed in context with all of the wrongful actions taken by Sheriff Hatcher, is a substantial act. This violation is also a class B felony and could result in up to 10 years in prison. That the sheriff, who has been elected to uphold the law, would also intentionally violate it, is substantial.{/blockquote}{p}To learn more about this PID list, Action News spoke with staff attorney Pam Loginsky at the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Loginsky explained in great detail where the list comes from. She also tells Action News that having an officer of the law placed on the PID list is not grounds for termination.{/p}{p}She explained that an officer on that list might provide testimony in court that could be challenged by the defense. If an officer was on the list, the prosecutor must make the decision on calling on that officer to testify. The potential risk is that a defense attorney could argue that the officer is known to be untrustworthy.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}Loginsky says that if an officer is on that list it does not mean they can't do their job. In this case, the person now on that PID list is the head of an entire sheriff's office. Loginsky says when dealing with the head of a department, it could cause the individual's constituency to have eroded confidence in them as a leader.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}On Monday, the Washington Fraternal Order of Police issued the following statement:{/p}{blockquote}The Washington Fraternal Order of Police (WAFOP) announced today its support for the placement of Benton County Sheriff Jerry Hatcher on the county&rsquo;s Brady list. This decision comes on the heels of the Washington State Supreme Court opinion allowing the recall petition to remove him from office. The Brady list includes the names of law enforcement officers whose credibility could be impeached at trial based on information about their truthfulness, honesty, or bias in a case.{/blockquote}{blockquote}Earlier this month in a unanimous opinion, the Court authorized the petition to recall Hatcher to move forward with signature gathering. The opinion noted that all eight charges in the recall petition are legally and factually sufficient and may proceed to be put before the voters.{/blockquote}{blockquote}&ldquo;The Washington Fraternal Order of Police supports the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court and believes the placement of Sheriff Hatcher on the Brady list is the correct course of action,&rdquo; said WAFOP president Marco Monteblanco. &ldquo;Credibility and truthfulness are at the core of what we do and our ability to serve the public.

COUNTY -- Action News has learned that Benton County Sheriff Gerald D. Hatcher has been added to a dubious list of law enforcement officers who may not be considered trustworthy in a court of law.{/p}{p}Sheriff Hatcher was added to the 'Potential Impeachment Disclosure' list, (sometimes referred to as a Brady List), a couple weeks ago. The list of officers on that list is constantly monitored and updated by Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller and his team.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}Action News learned about Hatcher's name being added to the list by filing a Freedom of Information Act request to the Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Miller promptly obliged by sending the updated list to our newsroom.{/p}{p}Officers on that PID list have{&nbsp;} been found to be considered untrustworthy for a number of potential reasons.{&nbsp;}{a href=\"https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony\"}This new{&nbsp;}addition to the list comes days after the Washington Supreme Court issued its lengthy opinion on the recall of Sheriff Jerry Hatcher.{/a}{&nbsp;}In the court's opinion,{&nbsp;} the court makes a special note of an internal review document completed by Hatcher.{/p}{p}The Supreme Court Decision states:{&nbsp;}{/p}{blockquote}Sheriff Hatcher produced a letter dated February 14, 2020 to the Franklin County sheriff with a formal request to initiate an administrative review. However according to the{&nbsp;}metadata, the letter he produced was actually created on February 21, 2020. Sergeant Erickson alleges that Sheriff Hatcher violated RCW 40.16.020, which criminalizes &ldquo;falsify[ing] any record or paper appertaining to the officer&rsquo;s office.{br}{/blockquote}{blockquote}The voters could find that Sheriff Hatcher did falsify the letter when he dated it for a date prior to the actual date the file was created. Although Sheriff Hatcher claims that it was backdated to when he had the initial conversation, we do not weigh the evidence.{&nbsp;}{/blockquote}{blockquote}Further, this is not simply an act of changing a date. Sheriff Hatcher falsified the date on the administrative review of himself, which he sent to his political ally. This act, when viewed in context with all of the wrongful actions taken by Sheriff Hatcher, is a substantial act. This violation is also a class B felony and could result in up to 10 years in prison. That the sheriff, who has been elected to uphold the law, would also intentionally violate it, is substantial.{/blockquote}{p}To learn more about this PID list, Action News spoke with staff attorney Pam Loginsky at the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Loginsky explained in great detail where the list comes from. She also tells Action News that having an officer of the law placed on the PID list is not grounds for termination.{/p}{p}She explained that an officer on that list might provide testimony in court that could be challenged by the defense. If an officer was on the list, the prosecutor must make the decision on calling on that officer to testify. The potential risk is that a defense attorney could argue that the officer is known to be untrustworthy.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}Loginsky says that if an officer is on that list it does not mean they can't do their job. In this case, the person now on that PID list is the head of an entire sheriff's office. Loginsky says when dealing with the head of a department, it could cause the individual's constituency to have eroded confidence in them as a leader.{&nbsp;}{/p}{p}On Monday, the Washington Fraternal Order of Police issued the following statement:{/p}{blockquote}The Washington Fraternal Order of Police (WAFOP) announced today its support for the placement of Benton County Sheriff Jerry Hatcher on the county&rsquo;s Brady list. This decision comes on the heels of the Washington State Supreme Court opinion allowing the recall petition to remove him from office. The Brady list includes the names of law enforcement officers whose credibility could be impeached at trial based on information about their truthfulness, honesty, or bias in a case.{/blockquote}{blockquote}Earlier this month in a unanimous opinion, the Court authorized the petition to recall Hatcher to move forward with signature gathering. The opinion noted that all eight charges in the recall petition are legally and factually sufficient and may proceed to be put before the voters.{/blockquote}{blockquote}&ldquo;The Washington Fraternal Order of Police supports the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court and believes the placement of Sheriff Hatcher on the Brady list is the correct course of action,&rdquo; said WAFOP president Marco Monteblanco. &ldquo;Credibility and truthfulness are at the core of what we do and our ability to serve the public.

Hatcher has been added to a dubious list of law enforcement officers who may not be considered trustworthy in a court of law. Sheriff Hatcher was added to the 'Potential Impeachment Disclosure' list, (sometimes referred to as a Brady List), a couple weeks ago. The list of officers on that list is constantly monitored and updated by Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller and his team. "

Hatcher has been added to a dubious list of law enforcement officers who may not be considered trustworthy in a court of law.</p><p>Sheriff Hatcher was added to the &#x27;Potential Impeachment Disclosure&#x27; list, (sometimes referred to as a Brady List), a couple weeks ago. The list of officers on that list is constantly monitored and updated by Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller and his team. </p><p>Action News learned about Hatcher&#x27;s name being added to the list by filing a Freedom of Information Act request to the Prosecuting Attorney&#x27;s Office. Miller promptly obliged by sending the updated list to our newsroom.</p><p>Officers on that PID list have  been found to be considered untrustworthy for a number of potential reasons. <a href="https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony" target="_blank" title="https://keprtv.com/news/local/supreme-court-opinion-states-sheriff-hatcher-potentially-committed-felony" class="themeColorForLinks">This new addition to the list comes days after the Washington Supreme Court issued its lengthy opinion on the recall of Sheriff Jerry Hatcher.</a> In the court&#x27;s opinion,  the court makes a special note of an internal review document completed by Hatcher.</p><p>The Supreme Court Decision states: </p><blockquote>Sheriff Hatcher produced a letter dated February 14, 2020 to the Franklin County sheriff with a formal request to initiate an administrative review. However according to the metadata, the letter he produced was actually created on February 21, 2020. Sergeant Erickson alleges that Sheriff Hatcher violated RCW 40.16.020, which criminalizes “falsify[ing] any record or paper appertaining to the officer’s office.<br/></blockquote><blockquote>The voters could find that Sheriff Hatcher did falsify the letter when he dated it for a date prior to the actual date the file was created. Although Sheriff Hatcher claims that it was backdated to when he had the initial conversation, we do not weigh the evidence. </blockquote><blockquote>Further, this is not simply an act of changing a date. Sheriff Hatcher falsified the date on the administrative review of himself, which he sent to his political ally. This act, when viewed in context with all of the wrongful actions taken by Sheriff Hatcher, is a substantial act. This violation is also a class B felony and could result in up to 10 years in prison. That the sheriff, who has been elected to uphold the law, would also intentionally violate it, is substantial.</blockquote><p>To learn more about this PID list, Action News spoke with staff attorney Pam Loginsky at the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Loginsky explained in great detail where the list comes from. She also tells Action News that having an officer of the law placed on the PID list is not grounds for termination.</p><p>She explained that an officer on that list might provide testimony in court that could be challenged by the defense. If an officer was on the list, the prosecutor must make the decision on calling on that officer to testify. The potential risk is that a defense attorney could argue that the officer is known to be untrustworthy. </p><p>Loginsky says that if an officer is on that list it does not mean they can&#x27;t do their job. In this case, the person now on that PID list is the head of an entire sheriff&#x27;s office. Loginsky says when dealing with the head of a department, it could cause the individual&#x27;s constituency to have eroded confidence in them as a leader. </p><p>On Monday, the Washington Fraternal Order of Police issued the following statement:</p><blockquote>The Washington Fraternal Order of Police (WAFOP) announced today its support for the placement of Benton County Sheriff Jerry Hatcher on the county’s Brady list. This decision comes on the heels of the Washington State Supreme Court opinion allowing the recall petition to remove him from office. The Brady list includes the names of law enforcement officers whose credibility could be impeached at trial based on information about their truthfulness, honesty, or bias in a case.</blockquote><blockquote>Earlier this month in a unanimous opinion, the Court authorized the petition to recall Hatcher to move forward with signature gathering. The opinion noted that all eight charges in the recall petition are legally and factually sufficient and may proceed to be put before the voters.</blockquote><blockquote>“The Washington Fraternal Order of Police supports the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court and believes the placement of Sheriff Hatcher on the Brady list is the correct course of action,” said WAFOP president Marco Monteblanco. “Credibility and truthfulness are at the core of what we do and our ability to serve the public. Our members agree with this listing and the Court’s decision allowing the petition to proceed.”</blockquote><p><br/></p></div></div></div></div><div id="js-Taboola-Container-0"
