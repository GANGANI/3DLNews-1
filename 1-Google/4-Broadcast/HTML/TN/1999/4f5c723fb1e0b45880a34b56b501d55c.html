She covered presidential border visits, immigration and women's health in the Hispanic community. \n\nPrior to working in her home state of Texas, Sydney worked at KMTV in Omaha, Nebraska, as the morning reporter and fill-in anchor. \n \nSome of her most impactful stories included the 100-year commemoration of Will Brown, a black man who was lynched in the middle of the city. She also covered the opening of the Lydon House, a home for previously incarcerated people in the LGBTQ + community. She also enjoyed covering the College World Series! \n\nSydney started her career in Ada, Oklahoma, at KXII as the bureau reporter covering the Texoma region. There, Sydney covered murder trials, school scandals, natural disasters and investigated hospital malpractice. \n\nHer most impactful story there, involved a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent 30 years in prison. Sydney interviewed him days after his release.  \n\nHer love of storytelling began in elementary school and continued into high school where she turned packages for her school district’s local channel, Frisco-ISD TV. \n\nShe's a proud graduate of Oklahoma State University. Go Pokes! She earned her bachelor’s degree in Sports Media in 2016, after interning at KTUL in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  \n\nSydney is a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and has worked as a mentor for NABJ’s high school journalism workshop for several years. Sydney is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. \n\nWhen she’s not working, Sydney enjoys spending time with family and friends, swimming and trying new restaurants! \n\nIf you have a story idea, or just want to say hello, follow Sydney on Facebook @SydneyGTV and on Twitter @Sydney_GTV.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-02-23T17:12:17.702Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wmctv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}},{"_id":"kelli-cook","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Kelli Cook","org":"Memphis, TN","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/raycom/bb8e3b49-5be0-4aa5-a1cb-9e97c85a4f27.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Kelli Cook is a reporter and anchor for Action News 5.

He's excited to arrive in the 901 during an exciting time for sports at all levels across the area.\n\nMatt comes to Memphis after spending nearly four years at our affiliate station, WSAW-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin. His time in Wausau was highlighted by his coverage of one of America's most iconic teams, the Green Bay Packers. He's been to Lambeau Field more times than he can count. \n\nOther moments that stick out from his tenure in Wisconsin include being in Milwaukee the night the Bucks won their first NBA championship in 50 years, as well as covering a Division-III Frozen Four and championship winner in 2019.\n\nMatt is a native New Yorker who grew up half an hour outside New York City on Long Island. He graduated with a broadcast news degree from the University of South Florida in Tampa, a city he considers his second home.\n\nDespite his New York roots, Matt's favorite sports team of all is the St. Louis Cardinals, and he's very happy to be in an area where they have so much support. It's a good thing he roots for an organization with such a winning tradition, because the other teams he roots for all bring him pain: The New York Jets, New York Knicks, and New York Islanders. He's also a big motorsports fan.\n\nMatt enjoys spending his down time with friends and family, watching sports, and finding new places to eat and drink. He considers himself an amateur barbeque snob and wants to try as many different BBQ places as possible around Memphis. Feel free to give him any and all recommendations.\n\nIf you have a story idea for Matt or just want to say hello, feel free to email him or reach out to him on Twitter.

the Action News 5 in May 2022.\n\nHer passion for broadcast journalism started at a young age in middle school as a school anchor, reading the morning news announcements.\n\nShe followed it from her hometown in Lakeland, Florida, to Baltimore, Maryland, where she received her degree in Multimedia Journalism from Morgan State University (Go Bears!).\n\nAfter graduation in December 2018, Stephanie took her first on-air job as a morning anchor in Alpena, Michigan, where she edited, produced, and anchored her show at WBKB News.\n\nA year later, Stephanie traded in her snow gear for cowboy boots and made the move to Odessa, Texas, to join CBS7, the #1 station in West Texas.\n\nWhen she's not on-air, you'll probably catch her out enjoying a day of shopping, watching a movie, cooking, dancing, or spending time with her family.\n\nIf you see her out and about, please say hello!\nYou can connect with Stephanie on Facebook at @Stephaniedotv or email story ideas to

She also worked part time at the local TV station in Tupelo where she was on air every weekend in the evening. \nMaggye was a researched based student, and her thesis was on excessive heat mortality, and criteria in the Unites States. Following passing her thesis defense and graduating, she moved to Tate County and decided to start forecasting for the Mid-South by joining the phenomenal First Alert Weather Team where she is closer to home. Apart from all things weather, she enjoys running, playing pickle ball, reading the Bible, and spending time with her husband, Charlie.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-08-09T17:32:37.259Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wmctv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:34:41.423Z","description":{"basic":"The International Space Station, or ISS, is a large space station that stays in a low Earth orbit.
