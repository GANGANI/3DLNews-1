As I prepared to begin my college career at Eastern Kentucky University, I knew I needed to pick a major. I did not really know what I wanted to do but having an English teacher as a mom it was not out of the realm of possibility for me to choose a career in writing. Having always been full of questions, I chose journalism as my major.  \n\nThroughout my first year of classes, I was unsure how well I would like the field. I added a second major in history as a backup option, but after covering my first investigative piece as a sophomore, I was hooked.  \n\nSince 2018, I have won more than a dozen awards from the Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Communication Association. I have interned both locally and in Wisconsin, but most recently I spent time serving as the People’s Editor and news reporter for The News Journal in Corbin.  \n\nDespite having grown up in Eastern Kentucky, I never knew how much I could genuinely love and care about telling the stories of the people in this community until I started working as a journalist. My time at the newspaper has introduced me to more friends than I thought possible in this career.  \n\nI am honored and excited to serve even more of the wonderful people here at home as a news producer with the WYMT news team. To friends, new and old, please do not hesitate to reach out with your stories.

James became active in the community through various outreach initiatives, whether it was speaking at local schools or volunteering to clean up the city. \n\n\nPrior to that, James served as a reporter/ fill-in anchor in Southeast Texas. He covered stories ranging from hurricanes, presidential visits to an explosion at a local oil refinery.\n\n\nOne of the stories that stands out most to him was when he was able to document a father’s ‘fight’ to see his terminally ill daughter in the hospital, at the height of the pandemic. Through his reporting, the hospital changed its policy and allowed him to reunite with her before she died. \n\n\nWhile there, he received a local press club award and was also a part of the station’s coverage which won a statewide Emmy.\n\n\nJames, a Dallas native, graduated from the University of North Texas. As you can imagine, he is a huge Dallas sports fan. \n\n\nWhen he’s not cheering for his favorite teams or reporting, he’s typically spending time with family, traveling or attending church. \n\n\nHe is excited to call the Music City home and looks forward to connecting with viewers and seeing all that the city has to offer.

In 2020 he was named “Best Weather Anchor” in the state of Tennessee by the Associated Press. He also carries the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist seal by the AMS, and the National Weather Association seal – the two highest certifications in the field.\n\nWhen he’s not forecasting the challenging weather for Tennesseans and Kentuckians, Ben’s passion is personalizing science and climate reporting. That often takes him into the mountains he grew up next to as a child.\n\nOn to the fun stuff: Ben loves to cook, travel, read, and hike. From comfort food, to a managers’ special, you’ll find it coming out of Ben’s kitchen.\n\nThere’s a lot of great hiking around East Tennessee (LeConte, Gregory Bald, Big South Fork) but Ben’s also gotten blisters on glaciers in the Icelandic Highlands, and scrambling over cliffs in Tasmania. There’s a tall pile of books in his house that needs to be read; usually he’s reading on the back porch with his coffee.\n\nOne question meteorologists always get: “How do you get into weather?” For Ben it happened around the third grade, when Hurricane Fran hit his hometown off of I-40 in North Carolina. He even went as a meteorologist to career day in elementary school.\n\nFast forward a few years – still a long time ago – to when Ben studied meteorology and broadcast journalism at the University of Miami. Go Canes! Ben graduated with honors and was part of two honors programs. While he got to meet a lot of people, and interviewed the Dalai Lama and President Clinton, there was plenty of time spent outside in the Everglades. He saved baby ducks from a storm drain, using pipe cleaners and a colander.\n\nAll of Ben’s family still lives nearby. From Etowah to Alcoa, generations of Catheys lived and worked around here. Ben’s grandfather was a UT grad and worked for Alcoa for decades. On his mom’s side, everyone’s within a 2.5 hour drive of downtown Knoxville. Ben loves cheering on the Big Orange and exploring all the new things sprouting up around town.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"middleName":"P","expertise":"Science reporting, climate change, field weather, space reporting,
