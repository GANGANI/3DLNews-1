<p></p>
If you were given the opportunity to do something special for a dear friend -- a constant companion whose presence has helped to enrich your life and cultivate your mind -- wouldn't you jump at such a chance without ever thinking twice?
<p></p>
I know I would. And I'm hoping you would, too.
<p></p>
Which is why I'm writing you now to offer you the chance to do just that -- to give something back to the one companion you can rely on to be there for you day in and day out -- KSKA Public Radio.
<p></p>
KSKA is committed to nourishing your mind and spirit through intellectual enlightenment and cultural awareness. It's a friend you can always count on to give you the news you trust and the music you enjoy -- twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
<p></p>
Whether you tune in to KSKA to hear award-winning music programs, such as <strong><em>A Prairie Home Companion</strong></em> and <strong><em>World Cafe</strong></em>...or you listen diligently to <strong><em>Morning Edition</em></strong> and <strong><em>All Things Considered</em></strong> for a discussion of the day's top issues...or you turn to <strong><em>Marketplace Money</em></strong> to answer you personal finance questions...or you go to this website for comprehensive news from around Alaska...
<p></p>
...KSKA is your constant companion. 
<p></p>
But none of this -- not the local call-in programs like <strong><em>Talk of Alaska</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hometown, Alaska</em></strong>...not the in-depth news programs analyzing critical worldwide events...not this website that has become intimately part of the KSKA experience -- would be possible without the generous support of KSKA's Members.
<p></p>
Take, for instance, the cost of airing some of the popular programs you hear on KSKA:
<p></p>
<strong>It costs KSKA nearly $190,000 dollars to air programs as Morning Edition and All Things Considered. To bring you the APRN statewide news service on this website and on KSKA's air, it costs over $930,000 per year.</strong> 
<p></p>
So as you can see, a great radio station comes at quite a price. And because KSKA doesn't air commercials, we must turn to listeners like you for extra-effort support.
<p></p>
At home, the office, or on the road, you can rely on KSKA to be your constant companion. I know I do.
<p></p>
Please join me and be a part of KSKA's special circle of active listeners and friends who are dedicated to giving something back to the radio service they care about the most. All you have to do is click on the button to the right and fill out the secure pledge form.

Yours truly,
<p></p>
