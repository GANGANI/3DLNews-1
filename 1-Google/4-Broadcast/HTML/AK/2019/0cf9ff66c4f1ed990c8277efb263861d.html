Aug. 21st***<br>Due to extremely dry, hazardous conditions and under the guidance of fire command we are unable to restore power to any of our Caswell members today. MEA crews continue to assist fire crews with damaged and hazardous tree removal as a result of the fire and ongoing burning. Crews are also working on fire restoration efforts, repairing damaged equipment, replacing poles, and removing trees from lines and other potential hazards. We are working closely with fire officials to determine when we can safely restore power to residents in the area. Power restoration will likely occur in a progressive state, meaning when we can re-energize lines, it will be done so in small sections at a time. We will provide new information or updates as they come available, and we greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during our response.</p><p>For fire updates, please contact 907-761-6233.&#8221;</p><p>8/21 4:10 pm: From KTNA&#8217;s Katie Writer, who attended this afternoon&#8217;s meeting at the Upper Susitna Senior Center, everyone living in the fire evacuation area has been accounted for.</p><p>8/21 4:09 pm: We&#8217;ve heard there may be some confusion about school on Friday.

Currently, they have been able to send the whole line at once, and there was not a backup down the Talkeetna Spur Road. That situation can change with no notice, however. If there is fire near the road, an ambulance that needs to access the area, or another emergency situation, the highway will be closed temporarily. Also, officials have been emphasizing that cars must stay on the highway. Side roads can still be dangerous, even if there is no fire, due to fallen trees and other hazards. There is a chase car with each group ensuring that vehicles stay on the highway.</p><p>8/20 11:15 am: The incident command team held a live briefing via Facebook at 9:30 this morning. The fire behavior is described as &#8220;creeping,&#8221; meaning it is moving along the edges, but is not being driven by the wind the way it was on Saturday and Sunday. We don&#8217;t have a new size estimate at this time. We are anticipating another briefing at noon. We will share that feed from Forestry, and we are planning to air it live as well. There is a community meeting at Willow Elementary scheduled for 3:00 pm. That is also planned to be streamed, and we plan to broadcast it. Borough personnel are conducting assessments of damage and destroyed structures today.</p><p>8/19 11:00 pm: Alaska Division of Forestry had a Facebook Live briefing late on Monday.  They said that the fire creeped down the highway to mile 84.  The northern edge is still at mile 92. The National Guard and Alaska State Troopers will continue to operate pilot cars along the Parks Highway through the fire zone and motorists should continue to expect significant delays heading north and south.  No re-entry will be allowed until further notice without exception. Active fire fighting continues between milepost 82 and 91. Motorists following pilot cars are not allowed to stop and check on properties. The recorded video is available at <a href="http://akfireinfo.com">akfireinfo.com</a> and a McKinley Fire Information <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNG47PzRR4IXn0C5gFVrD7A">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>8/19 9:35 pm: The Alaska Department of Public Safety, State Fire Marshal and Alaska State Troopers are working with the Alaska Division of Forestry and Matanuska-Susitna Borough to get a better estimate of structures burned and determine how many were residences. The State Fire Marshal’s Office and Alaska State Troopers are working to account for persons in the evacuation area. Traffic along the Parks Highway is open, but vehicles are being led by pilot cars between Mileposts 71 to 99.  Motorists should expect long delays and intermittent closures.  Alaska State Troopers and the Alaska National Guard are assisting with traffic control efforts. The Alaska Railroad has been working to remove downed trees and debris from along the tracks and expects to resume full service by Wednesday.</p><p> 8/19 5:05 pm:&nbsp; The Upper Susitna Seniors and Upper Susitna are establishing the Senior Center as a collection point for donations for people affected by the McKinley Fire.

That map is posted here. We should stress that the map does not indicate whether structures within the perimeter have burned.</p><p>8/19 1:30 pm: Trapper Creek Trading Post and Trapper Creek Inn and RV Park report that they have gas.</p><p>8/19 12:55 pm: The Mat-Su Borough is seeking information for people in the evacuation zone. If you evacuated from the McKinley fire, please call the <strong>Information Call Center at</strong> <strong>907-861-8326</strong> to confirm.

Motorists waiting to get through the fire zone on the Parks Highway from the north or south should anticipate a 4 to 5 hour wait. If you can delay your trip and avoid the &#8216;Y&#8217; area with the Talkeetna Spur Road, please do.</p><p>8/19 10:49 am:  We are hearing reports from multiple drivers that the Talkeetna Spur Road is backing up from the &#8220;Y&#8221; as people attempt to travel south on the Parks Highway.  If you are planning to head that way, expect delays.</p><p>8/19 10:28 am: The Alaska Railroad has canceled all passenger service between Anchorage and Denali Park due to the McKinley Fire.</p><ul

It was last updated a little after 1 am. If you would like to help, The Red Cross is requesting monetary donations only, through its Red Cross Alaska Website (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="www.redcross.org/local/alaska.html (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.redcross.org/local/alaska.html" target="_blank">www.redcross.org/local/alaska.html</a>) or over the phone during business hours at 907-646-5401.</p><p>8/18 11:58 pm: From Alaska Division of Forestry: A dramatic increase in fire intensity on the McKinley Fire near on Sunday afternoon resulted in the loss of at least 50 structures as firefighters and other emergency responders worked furiously to evacuate and rescue residents threatened by the fire. The latest size estimate on the fire was approximately 1,800 acres as of 10 p.m. Sunday. A Type 2 Incident Management Team from Alaska will be taking command of the McKinley Fire on Tuesday.</p><p>With the increase in wildfire activity in Southcentral Alaska the past two days, Forestry is also bringing up multiple other resources from the Lower 48 to assist with containment of fires. Ten hotshot crews are enroute to Alaska and should arrive Monday afternoon. Those crews will be split among the three fires. Two air retardant tankers and four water-scooping aircraft are also enroute to Alaska.<br>This entire update is available at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fakfireinfo.com%2F2019%2F08%2F18%2Fmckinley-fire-burns-at-least-50-structures-parks-highway-remains-closed%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2e0EUEmGL58g8w-wlbgQRwfpWEyK5Rzcg8PLXomswVN-l2tIejtddlXEc&amp;h=AT07GeuRh5xPuGCRIdgmi8xicwbf7hzcpsI9zGytfEO_FPBMpc1ptFuownEadBtPEIaZCEJepKq1j6NTSDisW2UlzFvoflgtaAMQUr_yOgopdVEIxO-KEG06c2UfyapcExqwkG11dgvuj0fveil15Gyx-xC1tY1g-g8b-03rYsTgEY1UF2LQaiugleCrJylR2GLkKr75ubrPJF509J0Ko_iAyeAgDNSZQKBCVPBk3PgTtbHi-PxF-g9EENgAoGN9Ozb4jwyn3mjlfOzWkmR9aEc8s-NNzJb9qh4sfuo_h4AaLF9UbPpRyHmdPuMEAd7A-LG0YfK30fu5i-n9ecyikM5ywsqfz2mqR9o1SqvgZq-TdJ63AHP37xA2POHhOhFUIVeNN7mOCBwtD-tq2BAEH-j1hxv8adEvY2tVhRtHj6vFUG380LZs-rvfZsPbnG07fmBS5evNivYDk8bWWzdezV5fzfaU0J8FFnvLkdaWIASgquAcgpN0OsEvcGW69w8DthJmtp3aLRz7LLHTM-x6yMMudiiMkieF-rEp-MjXVtE7AWaCKG_LMunm2EV75YkJMaWypjGFuyvUz4oay3EHMlfFFEjIlBpKeFig9db_timCoNX3oSG_BU8Kcq9riHVQ9PSz" target="_blank">https://akfireinfo.com/…/mckinley-fire-burns-at-9least-50-s…/</a>&nbsp;and an updated evacuation map has been added to this post.

Helena Avenue (just south of MP 99 at the Upper Susitna Senior Center). The evacuation zone remains on both sides of the highway from mile 91 to 82.</p><p>8/18 10:15 pm: The State Troopers have posted that the Parks Highway will be closed between MP 70 and 92 until at least late tomorrow morning (Monday 8/19) due to McKinley Wildfire activity. Please avoid the area. Motorists who must travel between Anchorage and Fairbanks might consider alternate routes utilizing the Glenn, Richardson, or Denali Highways.</p><p>8/18 9:30 pm: The north closure point of the Parks Highway has been moved slightly south to Helena Drive, where the Upper Susitna Community and Senior Center is.</p><p>8/18 7:30 pm: Be advised, the northern closure of the Parks Highway due to the McKinley Fire has been pushed back from Mile 91 to the Talkeetna Spur Road at Mile 99. Motorists are advised to avoid the area for their own safety. The Parks Highway is closed between miles 70 and 99.</p><p> The latest update from Forestry: <a href="http://The latest update from Forestry: https://akfireinfo.com/2019/08/18/evacuations-ordered-for-both-sides-of-parks-highway-from-mileposts-82-to-93-after-mckinley-fire-jumps-closes-road/">https://akfireinfo.com/2019/08/18/evacuations-ordered-for-both-sides-of-parks-highway-from-mileposts-82-to-93-after-mckinley-fire-jumps-closes-road/ </a></p><p>8/18 7:00 pm: Alaska Division of Forestry says that the wind-driven fire is moving very rapidly and the situation is evolving. Northbound traffic is being stopped at milepost 70 due to concerns for public safety. Parks Highway between Mileposts 83-93 is closed indefinitely. People are advised to stay away from the area.</p><p>8/18 6:45 pm: The Mat-Su Borough is reporting that the McKinley Fire is on both sides of the Parks Highway and they are evacuating both sides of the highway from mile 91 to 82.

We have received word from Talkeetna CERT that the current Talkeetna and Willow shelters can accommodate pets and livestock, based on size and number.</p><p>8/18 6:00 pm: The Alaska Division of Forestry has announced that they are evacuating all of Hidden Hills Road and subdivisions accessed via that road. The Parks Highway is closed from mile 85 to 92.

The Division of Forestry is aware this is a one-way-in, one-way-out road but at this point fire managers are confident the only homes that are potentially threatened are in the first mile of the road. DOF is monitoring the fire to determine if any future evacuations are necessary. If an area outside of the first mile of Hidden Hills Road needs to be evacuated, residents will be notified by the Division of Forestry, Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Alaska State Troopers.</p><p>8/18 4:10 pm: The Mat-Su Borough and Alaska Division of Forestry have not released any new information on the McKinley Fire since the evacuation notice 2 hours ago.  We expect that the 5 pm public briefing will provide clarification on that evacuation and other developments through the afternoon. We will stream that briefing on air and on Facebook.</p><p>8/18 2:56 pm: Internet and service have been restored to downtown Talkeetna and KTNA is streaming again at <a href="https://ktna.org/listen.html">ktna.org/listen.html</a>. We have limited channels on the stream so please only tune in that way if you cannot listen to KTNA on a radio so that people outside the area can follow what&#8217;s happening. Thank you.</p><p>8/18 2:09 pm:  The Alaska Division of Forestry is evacuating the first mile of Hidden Hills Road. We are attempting to get information for the reason for the evacuation.  We will be providing live on-air updates more often as this situation becomes more clear.</p><p>8/18 2:00 pm: We will be going to live updates on-air at the top of the hour, unless conditions change.</p><p>8/18 1:20 pm: The Mat-Su Borough and Alaska Division of Forestry just held a press conference. The cause of the McKinley Fire has not been determined yet. Not much has changed from previous updates below. The evacuation will remain in effect through today and re-assessed tomorrow. Borough Manager Moosey is in contact with School Superintendent Goyette to determine if there will be any changes to school schedules in the upper valley tomorrow. There will be more information on that at a 5:00 public briefing that the borough will hold.</p><p>8/18 11:58 am: KTNA&#8217;s Katie Writer has been to the Talkeetna Airport, where a Forestry plane landed due to smoke in its cockpit. The plane has been moved off of the runway, and there are no apparent injuries.</p><p>8/18 11:50 am: KTNA has lost landline and internet connectivity. Our stream is currently offline.</p><p>8/18 11:10 am: The Alaska Division of Forestry has released its first update of the day. The McKinley Fire did not move significantly overnight and remains estimated at approximately 150 acres. There are approximately 70 personnel working on the fire with another crew – the Midnight Sun Interagency Hotshot Crew – enroute.

The Alaska Incident Management Team will provide an update on the current fire situation and will be able to answer any questions from the community.\n\n\n\n 8\/22 8:30 pm: MEA is currently in the process of reenergizing the main electrical lines. This is a coordinated effort between MEA and fire personnel. Once the main line is determined to be completely recharged and firefighters are clear, MEA will begin to initiate a north to south pole by pole reenergization of the main line. \n\n\n\n\nMcKinley Fire Update &#8211; Coordinated Efforts to Reenergize Powerlines in&nbsp;Process\n\n\n\n\n8\/22 10:05 am: Updated fire map for the McKinley fire has been released\n\n\n\n8\/21 11:14 pm: The McKinley Fire is now 10% contained, and new mapping has revealed that it is smaller than previously measured.

Aug. 21st***Due to extremely dry, hazardous conditions and under the guidance of fire command we are unable to restore power to any of our Caswell members today. MEA crews continue to assist fire crews with damaged and hazardous tree removal as a result of the fire and ongoing burning. Crews are also working on fire restoration efforts, repairing damaged equipment, replacing poles, and removing trees from lines and other potential hazards. We are working closely with fire officials to determine when we can safely restore power to residents in the area. Power restoration will likely occur in a progressive state, meaning when we can re-energize lines, it will be done so in small sections at a time. We will provide new information or updates as they come available, and we greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during our response.\n\n\n\nFor fire updates, please contact 907-761-6233.&#8221;\n\n\n\n8\/21 4:10 pm: From KTNA&#8217;s Katie Writer, who attended this afternoon&#8217;s meeting at the Upper Susitna Senior Center, everyone living in the fire evacuation area has been accounted for.\n\n\n\n8\/21 4:09 pm: We&#8217;ve heard there may be some confusion about school on Friday.

Currently, they have been able to send the whole line at once, and there was not a backup down the Talkeetna Spur Road. That situation can change with no notice, however. If there is fire near the road, an ambulance that needs to access the area, or another emergency situation, the highway will be closed temporarily. Also, officials have been emphasizing that cars must stay on the highway. Side roads can still be dangerous, even if there is no fire, due to fallen trees and other hazards. There is a chase car with each group ensuring that vehicles stay on the highway.\n\n\n\n8\/20 11:15 am: The incident command team held a live briefing via Facebook at 9:30 this morning. The fire behavior is described as &#8220;creeping,&#8221; meaning it is moving along the edges, but is not being driven by the wind the way it was on Saturday and Sunday. We don&#8217;t have a new size estimate at this time. We are anticipating another briefing at noon. We will share that feed from Forestry, and we are planning to air it live as well. There is a community meeting at Willow Elementary scheduled for 3:00 pm. That is also planned to be streamed, and we plan to broadcast it. Borough personnel are conducting assessments of damage and destroyed structures today.\n\n\n\n8\/19 11:00 pm: Alaska Division of Forestry had a Facebook Live briefing late on Monday.  They said that the fire creeped down the highway to mile 84.  The northern edge is still at mile 92. The National Guard and Alaska State Troopers will continue to operate pilot cars along the Parks Highway through the fire zone and motorists should continue to expect significant delays heading north and south.  No re-entry will be allowed until further notice without exception. Active fire fighting continues between milepost 82 and 91. Motorists following pilot cars are not allowed to stop and check on properties. The recorded video is available at akfireinfo.com and a McKinley Fire Information YouTube channel.\n\n\n\n8\/19 9:35 pm: The Alaska Department of Public Safety, State Fire Marshal and Alaska State Troopers are working with the Alaska Division of Forestry and Matanuska-Susitna Borough to get a better estimate of structures burned and determine how many were residences. The State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office and Alaska State Troopers are working to account for persons in the evacuation area. Traffic along the Parks Highway is open, but vehicles are being led by pilot cars between Mileposts 71 to 99.  Motorists should expect long delays and intermittent closures.  Alaska State Troopers and the Alaska National Guard are assisting with traffic control efforts. The Alaska Railroad has been working to remove downed trees and debris from along the tracks and expects to resume full service by Wednesday.     \n\n\n\n 8\/19 5:05 pm:&nbsp; The Upper Susitna Seniors and Upper Susitna are establishing the Senior Center as a collection point for donations for people affected by the McKinley Fire.

That map is posted here. We should stress that the map does not indicate whether structures within the perimeter have burned.\n\n\n\n8\/19 1:30 pm: Trapper Creek Trading Post and Trapper Creek Inn and RV Park report that they have gas. \n\n\n\n8\/19 12:55 pm: The Mat-Su Borough is seeking information for people in the evacuation zone.

Crowley Fuels near mile 11 on the Talkeetna Spur Road does have gas. \n\n\n\nEvacuations from mile 91 to 82 are still in effect and homeowners are not being allowed back into the zone. \n\n\n\n8\/19 11:00 am: Eric Chappel, Talkeetna Fire Department chief, confirmed that one pilot car is taking 30 to 50 cars at a time through the fire zone and that each round trip is taking a little over an hour.  Motorists waiting to get through the fire zone on the Parks Highway from the north or south should anticipate a 4 to 5 hour wait. If you can delay your trip and avoid the &#8216;Y&#8217; area with the Talkeetna Spur Road, please do.\n\n\n\n8\/19 10:49 am:  We are hearing reports from multiple drivers that the Talkeetna Spur Road is backing up from the &#8220;Y&#8221; as people attempt to travel south on the Parks Highway.  If you are planning to head that way, expect delays.\n\n\n\n8\/19 10:28 am: The Alaska Railroad has canceled all passenger service between Anchorage and Denali Park due to the McKinley Fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\/19 9:38 am: Fire is now estimated at 2,000 acres.

The latest size estimate on the fire was approximately 1,800 acres as of 10 p.m. Sunday. A Type 2 Incident Management Team from Alaska will be taking command of the McKinley Fire on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWith the increase in wildfire activity in Southcentral Alaska the past two days, Forestry is also bringing up multiple other resources from the Lower 48 to assist with containment of fires. Ten hotshot crews are enroute to Alaska and should arrive Monday afternoon. Those crews will be split among the three fires. Two air retardant tankers and four water-scooping aircraft are also enroute to Alaska.This entire update is available at&nbsp;https:\/\/akfireinfo.com\/\u2026\/mckinley-fire-burns-at-9least-50-s\u2026\/&nbsp;and an updated evacuation map has been added to this post.

The Division of Forestry is aware this is a one-way-in, one-way-out road but at this point fire managers are confident the only homes that are potentially threatened are in the first mile of the road. DOF is monitoring the fire to determine if any future evacuations are necessary. If an area outside of the first mile of Hidden Hills Road needs to be evacuated, residents will be notified by the Division of Forestry, Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Alaska State Troopers. \n\n\n\n8\/18 4:10 pm: The Mat-Su Borough and Alaska Division of Forestry have not released any new information on the McKinley Fire since the evacuation notice 2 hours ago.

If there is fire near the road, an ambulance that needs to access the area, or another emergency situation, the highway will be closed temporarily. Also, officials have been emphasizing that cars must stay on the highway. Side roads can still be dangerous, even if there is no fire, due to fallen trees and other hazards.

The Division of Forestry is aware this is a one-way-in, one-way-out road but at this point fire managers are confident the only homes that are potentially threatened are in the first mile of the road. DOF is monitoring the fire to determine if any future evacuations are necessary. If an area outside of the first mile of Hidden Hills Road needs to be evacuated, residents will be notified by the Division of Forestry, Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Alaska State Troopers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8\/18 4:10 pm: The Mat-Su Borough and Alaska Division of Forestry have not released any new information on the McKinley Fire since the evacuation notice 2 hours ago.

There will be more information on that at a 5:00 public briefing that the borough will hold. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8\/18 11:58 am: KTNA&#8217;s Katie Writer has been to the Talkeetna Airport, where a Forestry plane landed due to smoke in its cockpit. The plane has been moved off of the runway, and there are no apparent injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8\/18 11:50 am: KTNA has lost landline and internet connectivity.
