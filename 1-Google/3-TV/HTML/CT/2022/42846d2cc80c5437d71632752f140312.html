She also received the “Irish Heritage Award” from The Irish Echo. During her time at WFSB, Erin had the opportunity to cover Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, the 2016 Presidential Debate at Hofstra University in New York and the Traveler's Championship.\n\nAs a member of the station's investigative unit, she helped spearhead the series, Fugitive Files, which highlighted local cold cases. The stories resulted in multiple arrests and brought justice to several families. One of her proudest professional accomplishments came in 2017 when she was able to share the story of a local man in desperate need of a liver. A viewer saw Erin’s piece and made the selfless decision to donate her organ and save the man's life. Erin was able to reunite the pair following the surgery, and they are now friends for life. An active volunteer, she has helped raise money for many Connecticut organizations and charities.\n\nPrior to arriving in Connecticut, Erin was an anchor and reporter for Time Warner Cable News in Albany, New York. She covered some major political stories at the New York State Capitol including several Presidential visits. Some of her favorite assignments include reporting from the Travers Stakes in Saratoga Springs, the New York State Fair in Syracuse, and the men’s NCAA Final Four Basketball tournament in Atlanta. Erin also served as an anchor and reporter for WCTI (ABC/FOX) in New Bern, North Carolina and KEYC (CBS/FOX) in Mankato, Minnesota. Her first job in the television business was at the nationally syndicated hit television show, Inside Edition. As a story coordinator, Erin worked in a fast-paced newsroom booking multiple exclusives and had the opportunity to interview a number of news personalities and celebrities at red carpet events, including: Walter Cronkite, Elton John, John Travolta, Gayle King, Jon Bon Jovi, and Billy Joel.\n\nA graduate of Tufts University with a degree in political science and mass media & communications studies, Erin was co-captain of the women's basketball team and honored on the NESCAC All-Academic Team. She made 99 three-pointers during her four-year career with the Jumbos to rank 12th on the team's all-time list for that category. She was also the Vice President of her freshman class, a Chi Omega sorority sister, a viewpoint columnist for the Tufts Daily, a campus tour guide, an anchor/reporter for TUTV News, and the co-host of a television dating show. Erin studied abroad in Talloires, France. In her professional capacity, Erin served as the MC of the Tufts Athletics Hall of Fame Induction Dinner in 2019.\n\nErin was the captain of her soccer, basketball and lacrosse teams at Syosset High School and was voted Best Female Athlete of her senior class.

Nicole wears many hats at Ch. 3! Her newest role began in September of 2022 when she was named the co-host of “Great Day at 9A”, alongside Scot Haney. Nicole also hosts weekly franchises including: \"Family Friday\", “What's Going On\", \"The Bright Spot\", and \"3 Things You Need to Know & 1 You Don't\". She also has a strong foothold in the podcast world! Nicole produces and hosts a weekly show called, \"Mommyhood Unscripted\"--which is available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Her podcast tackles some of the biggest topics and least discussed issues surrounding motherhood. Nicole, a mom of two, takes listeners along for the ride and shares the meaningful conversations she has with some of the top experts and social influencers from around our country.\n\nBefore coming to Connecticut, Nicole spent several years anchoring and reporting in the mornings at WWLP in Springfield, MA. She was one of the first “live on-scene” reporters from western Massachusetts, during the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect; CNN aired several of her live reports and her coverage contributed to an Emmy-winning newscast. Just days after Hurricane Sandy paralyzed parts of the Northeast, Nicole accompanied local pilots who were delivering aid to one of the hardest hit areas in New Jersey, and documented her journey. She also covered the deadly tornado that ripped through western Massachusetts in 2011.\n\nNicole graduated from Westfield State University with a Communication degree. She was selected for a post-grad internship at CBS News in New York on the \"Evening News with Katie Couric\"--where she found herself handing her favorite T.V. anchor her scripts each night. Nicole also pitched an investigative piece for 60 Minutes which she presented in front of CBS News execs.\n\nWhen she’s not on-air, Nicole keeps very busy in the community. She volunteers for numerous non-profits that benefit children, the special needs community, mothers, animals, and music. She also dedicates much of her free time visiting local schools, reading to students, emceeing numerous events, and raising money for charity. But if you were to ask her, Nicole would tell you her greatest achievement to date has been becoming a mother. She is also a proud dog mom to 'Ringo'.\n\n\nIf you have a story idea or topic suggestion for her podcast, Nicole would love to hear from you! \nSend her an email: nicole.nalepa@wfsb.com \n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wfsb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-01-19T13:21:10.598Z","twitter":"nicolenalepatv","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/nicolenalepatv","custom_gray_displaypriority":4,"instagram":"nicolenalepatv","website_url":"/authors/Nicole-Nalepa/","headlines":{"basic":"Nicole Nalepa"},"description":{"basic":"Nicole Nalepa is the anchor of Connecticut’s #1 morning newscast, “Eyewitness News This Morning\", and the co-host of WFSB's newest lifestyle T.V. show--\"Great Day at 9A.\""},"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"Nicole.nalepa@wfsb.com"},{"site":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/nicolenalepatv"},{"site":"twitter","url":"nicolenalepatv"},{"site":"instagram","url":"nicolenalepatv"}],"type":"author","custom_gray_biovideouuid":"","hasVideoCenterVideo":false,"promo_items":{"basic":{"type":"image","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/0a9758f2-a4cb-4728-bc14-8c452c98ac91.png","auth":{"3":"3ac1e4713ef48f85b690d53fef9bd885d21043b09d4f8ac310871e96d4851b2a"}}},"dataTransformedAt":"2024-05-31T00:09:36.245Z"},{"_id":"caitlin-francis","firstName":"Caitlin  ","lastName":"Francis","byline":"Caitlin Francis","role":"Traffic Anchor","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/52265d3d-1717-4a32-9894-a501b57d9396.png","email":"caitlin.francis@wfsb.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CaitlinMFrancis","twitter":"caaitlinmfrancis","bio_page":"/authors/caitlin-francis/","location":"Connecticut","bio":"Caitlin Francis is an award winning anchor, and joined WFSB in November, 2019.

A member of the American Meteorological Society, Mark has been recognized by his peers with the prestigious AMS Seal of Approval.\nMark cultivated an interest in weather at an early age. He jokes that he declared his major as a Cub Scout when he toured a television station in his hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma at the age of 8. His fascination with weather continued as he grew up in the heart of Tornado Alley. As only a junior in high school, Mark interned at KJRH-TV, and when it came time for college, he moved on to the University of Oklahoma, a top school in the country for meteorology and the best for severe weather research and forecasting.\nIt is at OU that he earned a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology. Mark began his on-air career while attending college, as a junior, at the same station where he toured and interned in Tulsa.\nAfter graduating, Mark moved on to Little Rock, Arkansas for his first full-time job, where he won an Associated Press award: \"Best Weather Segment\" for a summer heat demonstration. He also was highly involved with the inception and development of his station's local WeatherNet.\nFrom growing up and working in Oklahoma and then working in Arkansas, his experience with the severity of Tornado Alley has provided him with extensive experience pertaining to all types of extreme weather.  Working with recently retired Bruce DePrest, a forecaster of New England weather for over 40 years, has enabled him to hone his forecasting abilities in the realm of winter storms.  In Connecticut now for nearly 2 decades, Mark has clearly made the Nutmeg State his home.  \nMark's favorite part about living in this part of the country is the diversity of the weather and the extremes that can accompany the different seasons… from severe weather, to tropical weather, to nor'easters, to a gorgeous autumn day.\nIn addition to his duties as meteorologist, Mark has actively been a part of the Connecticut Science Center, dating back to when it was only a parking lot in Hartford. Also, for 4 years, he also served as the host of WFSB's \"Cool Schools\" franchise. A platform that gave him an opportunity to showcase all of the fun and unique things happening at schools all across the state.\nOutside of the station, Mark enjoys spending time at the gym and at times running. \nIn the realm of running, he has completed eight marathons: Oklahoma City, Dallas White Rock, Chicago, Austin, St. Louis, Little Rock, Hartford and New York City. Those were all accomplished a while ago, he now focuses on 5k, 10k and half marathon distances. He has even dabbled in the realm of triathlon, completing sprint and Olympic distance events.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wfsb","last_updated_date":"2024-03-15T18:47:31.121Z","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":1,"website_url":"/authors/mark-dixon/","headlines":{"basic":"Mark Dixon"},"description":{"basic":"Mark Dixon can be seen weekdays on Channel 3 Eyewitness News from 4:00 to 6:30 pm and at 11 pm.

It was the first time she ever had to sleep at a tv station.\n\nWhile working in Springfield, Missouri, Jill won an honorable mention award for Best Weathercast. Weather is a passion of hers, especially severe weather. She started storm chasing in 2008 and even worked for a storm chasing company called Extreme Chase Tours. She chases any opportunity she gets, because she loves the weather – seeing the entire life cycle of a storm and capturing images of it.\n\nJill is so thankful for the path that life has taken her on this far; because of her time spent in Alabama, she met her wife and the 13 pets she calls her fur-kids. Yes, she said 13! Clearly an animal lover, her house has 3 dogs and 10 cats running around and entertaining everyone. You’ll likely find Jill supporting local animal rescues, in the community. She is also into fitness, sports, gardening, yard work, camping, nature, music, and is an artist, in her free time. \n\nLook for her on Wednesday and Thursday evenings reporting on weather related stories, broadcasting the weather at 11PM on Fridays, and on weekend evenings. Of course, she will be filling in at times on all shifts and helping out as needed during Early Warning Weather Alert days. Jill also loves engaging with viewers on her Facebook fan page, Twitter and Instagram, so please say hello!\n","org":"WBRC","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Meteorologist","slug":"","source":{"source_id":"24872422"},"status":true,"twitter":"jillgilardi","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2024-04-25T20:16:41.357Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wfsb","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","bio_page":"/authors/jill-gilardi/","location":"Rocky Hill, CT","custom_gray_displaypriority":5,"website_url":"/authors/jill-gilardi/","headlines":{"basic":"Jill Gilardi"},"description":{"basic":"Jill Gilardi joined Channel 3 Eyewitness News on November 9, 2022.

At the time a 4th grade student in West Hartford, she vividly remembers a giant tree being uprooted in front of her childhood home. Ever since then, she soaked up as much information about weather as she could, eventually studying Meteorology at Villanova University. Melissa worked at both WIVT in Binghamton, NY and WHP in Harrisburg, PA before coming to WFSB in 2003. She started her career here as the Weekend Meteorologist, and now lends an extra hand during severe weather events, and also fills in for her co-workers. She has been part of the WFSB family for over 10 years!\n\nMelissa is also an Emmy nominated reporter for the Better Connecticut show, most recently nominated for a story on Pediatric Cancer Awareness. Her favorite part about reporting is how no two days are ever the same. Whether it's a new bakery, an local invention, or an amazing student-it's true what they say, everyone has a story, and Melissa is happy to bring that story to the Better CT viewers each week.\n\nMelissa has 2 children.

She started her career as an anchor/reporter in Elmira, New York. Sam is originally from Philadelphia so cold weather doesn't scare her, and she has great cheesesteak recommendations. \n\nSam's reporting over the years has changed laws, prompted internal affairs investigations at the state and local level, and resignations from top officials at major agencies. She's also gotten results for dozens and dozens of viewers across many states. \n\nHer reporting in Boston on the city's citizen review board for police complaints, or lack thereof, led to the creation of a new and improved board, with more power than before. She also got a MA landlord to fix a major foundation problem on the spot for a tenant, as well as uncovered a local contractor using the license of another to do construction projects. \n\nIn Florida, Sam's reporting changed Florida health policy after she found unsafe food being delivered to day cares, putting children at major risk. Her investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation inside Palm Beach County Fire Rescue led to the firing and forced retirements of three top chiefs.
