She was born and raised in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. \nMost recently, Cassidy was a reporter and fill-in anchor at FOX6 in Milwaukee. During her four years there, she covered everything from the unrest in Kenosha to the Bucks 2021 Championship. She earned several Chicago/Midwest regional Emmy nominations including for Best Daily News Reporter in 2022. \nPrior to Milwaukee, Cassidy was a multimedia journalist at WSBT in South Bend. Before that, she was a student at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She graduated with degrees in both Broadcast Journalism and Political Science with minors in Sociology and Public Relations. \nCassidy takes pride in her empathetic storytelling. She knows first-hand what it’s like to be the one interviewed on your worst day. In 2019, she was one of more than 100 people who lost everything in an apartment fire. She uses that experience to ground her coverage of sensitive and emotional topics. \nWhile she has covered many different things, Cassidy’s passion has always lied in investigative journalism. She is honored to now help the people of Connecticut dig into issues and get results. \nOutside of work, Cassidy is a proud cat mom who loves being outside and eating tacos. She is always looking for recommendations for good bike trails and authentic Mexican food.

A member of the American Meteorological Society, Mark has been recognized by his peers with the prestigious AMS Seal of Approval.\nMark cultivated an interest in weather at an early age. He jokes that he declared his major as a Cub Scout when he toured a television station in his hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma at the age of 8. His fascination with weather continued as he grew up in the heart of Tornado Alley. As only a junior in high school, Mark interned at KJRH-TV, and when it came time for college, he moved on to the University of Oklahoma, a top school in the country for meteorology and the best for severe weather research and forecasting.\nIt is at OU that he earned a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology. Mark began his on-air career while attending college, as a junior, at the same station where he toured and interned in Tulsa.\nAfter graduating, Mark moved on to Little Rock, Arkansas for his first full-time job, where he won an Associated Press award: \"Best Weather Segment\" for a summer heat demonstration. He also was highly involved with the inception and development of his station's local WeatherNet.\nFrom growing up and working in Oklahoma and then working in Arkansas, his experience with the severity of Tornado Alley has provided him with extensive experience pertaining to all types of extreme weather.  Working with recently retired Bruce DePrest, a forecaster of New England weather for over 40 years, has enabled him to hone his forecasting abilities in the realm of winter storms.  In Connecticut now for nearly 2 decades, Mark has clearly made the Nutmeg State his home.  \nMark's favorite part about living in this part of the country is the diversity of the weather and the extremes that can accompany the different seasons… from severe weather, to tropical weather, to nor'easters, to a gorgeous autumn day.\nIn addition to his duties as meteorologist, Mark has actively been a part of the Connecticut Science Center, dating back to when it was only a parking lot in Hartford. Also, for 4 years, he also served as the host of WFSB's \"Cool Schools\" franchise. A platform that gave him an opportunity to showcase all of the fun and unique things happening at schools all across the state.\nOutside of the station, Mark enjoys spending time at the gym and at times running. \nIn the realm of running, he has completed eight marathons: Oklahoma City, Dallas White Rock, Chicago, Austin, St. Louis, Little Rock, Hartford and New York City. Those were all accomplished a while ago, he now focuses on 5k, 10k and half marathon distances. He has even dabbled in the realm of triathlon, completing sprint and Olympic distance events.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wfsb","last_updated_date":"2024-03-15T18:47:31.121Z","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:23:37.706Z","description":{"basic":"The

case."},{"_id":"GST2BJYJWZBXDOUBEVRJRFJWDQ","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"The 12-person jury was sent home around 4 p.m. after about 4 1/2 hours

A guilty verdict would deliver a stunning legal reckoning for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to reclaim the White House while an an acquittal would represent a major win for Trump and embolden him on the campaign trail.

A Meriden native and UConn graduate, Hector is thrilled to be reporting in his home state! Before coming back home Hector was a sports/news reporter at WLNE-ABC6 in Providence, R.I. He also filled in on the anchor desk for news and sports as well.\n\nIn Providence, Hector covered a wide range of stories from Patriots and Bruins games to the legalization of marijuana. He was also on Martha's Vineyard when about 50 Venezuela migrants were sent there from Texas. Before Providence, Hector began his Journalism career at WWLP-TV in Springfield, Mass. In Springfield, Hector covered multiple political races, snow storms and was the first TV reporter on scene when multiple bodies were found in the backyard of a Springfield home. He also covered multiple Patriots playoff games, a Bruins Stanley Cup and a Red Sox World Series.\n\nWhen he isn't reporting Hector is watching sports (especially his UConn Huskies!!), trying new restaurants and spending time with family and friends. \n\nHave a story idea?

She traveled to China with the Savannah mayoral delegation, rode alongside search teams when flash floods wiped out an Arkansas campground, and covered the murder trial of Curtis Vance.\n\nStephanie is from the Boston area but lives in Connecticut with her husband, Roger Susanin, who is a fantastic reporter for WFSB, and their two children.\n\nWhen she’s not on television, she’s searching out the state’s best playgrounds, scoping out vintage furniture, and spending as much time as she can on beautiful Connecticut beaches.\n\nIf you have a news tip or just want to say hello shoot her an email
