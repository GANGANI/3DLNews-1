She comes to Greenville from Charlotte, N.C. Formally, she was a health reporter and multimedia journalist. She covered the latest medical breakthroughs, navigating high healthcare costs and inspirational stories of survival. She was awarded Multimedia Journalist of the Year, 2nd place, by The Radio Television Digital News Association of the Carolinas. \n\nPrior to that, Kari was a weekend anchor in Lynchburg. VA. Her co-anchor coverage of the White Nationalist rally in Charlottesville won an Edward R. Murrow award. Kari also worked in Albany, NY as a morning reporter. Her first job was in Lafayette, LA where she learned about Cajun culture and Mardi Gras!\n\nThe Fun Stuff\n\nOn the weekends, I love to go hiking, paddle boarding, biking, rock climbing or really anything fun outside.\nMy favorite movie is Gladiator\nMy favorite kind of music is pop.\nMy favorite food is lobster.\nHobbies: Exercising, yoga, outdoor activities\n\nWhat is the most memorable story you've covered?\nMy most memorable story is one I covered about drug addiction. A 9-year-old girl found her mother dead from a drug overdose. The girl was 11 years old when I spoke to her. She described the scene of finding her mother blue in the face with her head down. It is not a sight anyone should have to witness, let alone a child. It was apparent the child was still processing what happened, but she spoke out in hopes it would bring change. The impact of the opioid epidemic stretched far and wide. I will never forget that story and I hope the viewers who watched it won’t either.
