He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:51:28.268Z","location":"Roanoke

That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:51:28.268Z","location":"Roanoke VA","custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T14:55:57.397Z","description":{"basic":"No further information has been released about the circumstances or possible cause of her death."},"headlines":{"basic":"Police release name of woman found dead in Lynchburg","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/fKsVygO36LVHAY0WlBcJImqn9sw=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"lpd thumb.png","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","owner":"leila.mitchell@wdbj7.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/fKsVygO36LVHAY0WlBcJImqn9sw=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/fKsVygO36LVHAY0WlBcJImqn9sw=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/z72MmX9-3Tm4Ro1h8kWohmVZ5rE=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","usage_instructions":"no restrictions","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"a00788e3816e5c71aade8258083c88397cea808a8e4fb3da4c099bf5e689e39d"},"caption":"Lynchburg Police Department","created_date":"2024-03-01T20:39:34Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"wdbj","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":1080,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-03-01T20:39:34Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Lynchburg Police Department","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/55SOSX2VV5FTLGDZQ7VLZ6FPXQ.png","version":"0.10.9","width":1920,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"wdbj"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wdbj":{"website_section":{"path":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","_id":"/news/investigation","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/29/body-found-lynchburg-idd/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wdbj","websites":{"wdbj":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Investigation","path":"/news/investigation","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","site":{"site_title":"Investigation"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Investigation"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1087},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/investigation"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wdbj./news/investigation"},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/police-release-name-body-found-lynchburg/"}},"_id":"BB5PJFLGQNDV3NVP5GRUDQ57NE","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Investigation","path":"/news/investigation","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","site":{"site_title":"Investigation"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Investigation"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1087},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/investigation"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wdbj./news/investigation"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/police-release-name-body-found-lynchburg/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/29/local-iraq-veteran-heads-normandy-80th-anniversary-d-day/","content_elements":[{"_id":"Z4YX6UHJO5AWXHUWDLW7CVJFQA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"3FG4QSV6YJAWFOPRGZXCQCNR5A","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"BLACKSBURG, Va.

After visiting a local news station in her hometown of Portland, Oregon, she knew she wanted to pursue meteorology. \n\nShe got a taste of the blistering Southwest heat when she attended Arizona State University (ASU) to study meteorology/climatology and broadcast journalism. While in Phoenix, Payton worked for Cronkite News as a meteorologist and digital producer. She also worked for WeatherRate and the Arizona State Climate Office. \n\nIn the summer of 2022, she interned for CNN Weather in Atlanta, Georgia. There, she wrote digital weather/climate stories and forecasted major storms around the world. She graduated from ASU in May 2023 with a dual degree in Geography and Journalism, as well as two certificates.\n\nPayton joined the WDBJ7 weather team in July 2023. She is excited to kick-start her career in the Star City and cover all four seasons. She wants to help bridge the communication gap between science and the public to make weather accessible to all communities.\n\nOutside of being a weather nerd, Payton enjoys spending time with her kitty Dakota, going on hikes, and exploring the local food scene.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:53:28.765Z","twitter":"major_weather"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T22:09:03.970Z","description":{"basic":"A line of strong storms produced an EF-1 tornado in the city of Salem Sunday evening.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:51:28.268Z","location":"Roanoke VA","custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-28T14:58:07.391Z","description":{"basic":"The body of a suspect in a sexual battery case was found after a search in Alleghany County."},"headlines":{"basic":"Body of sex crime suspect found in Alleghany County","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/VDp5QuyxZFeqDttxTlC_4IOZY5s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"MGN_1280x720_60926B00-LIUJL.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","owner":"mike.brantley@fox10tv.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/VDp5QuyxZFeqDttxTlC_4IOZY5s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/VDp5QuyxZFeqDttxTlC_4IOZY5s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/aRLn1a42YTl7JfEuTpOfiEkcJzI=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","usage_instructions":"Free to use","version":0,"template_id":35},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"82431a621ff8cbc23927c65be27b95dbfeab7ad10d2702f386a80d4d81b75e0f"},"caption":"","created_date":"2024-03-08T16:24:08Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"MGN","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"c94b026e-6d3f-4480-babe-a94e3b83e4e2"},"height":720,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-03-08T16:24:08Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"MGN Online (Images)","source_type":"wires","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Police lights and crime tape generic","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/2DLK7RC2EFGSLGEKDW2FRJLVGY.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"MGN"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wdbj":{"website_section":{"path":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","_id":"/news/investigation","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/28/body-found-alleghany-county/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wdbj","websites":{"wdbj":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Investigation","path":"/news/investigation","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","site":{"site_title":"Investigation"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Investigation"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1087},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/investigation"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wdbj./news/investigation"},"website_url":"/2024/05/28/body-sex-crime-suspect-found-alleghany-county/"}},"_id":"SQNI6PIBJVG3LFQY7BJ7BTGHNE","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Investigation","path":"/news/investigation","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/investigation","_website":"wdbj","name":"Investigation","site":{"site_title":"Investigation"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Investigation"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1087},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/investigation"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wdbj./news/investigation"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/28/body-sex-crime-suspect-found-alleghany-county/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/28/ive-got-better-chance-now-than-ive-ever-had-before-inmate-speaks-out-about-programs-put-place-by-roanoke-city-sheriffs-office/","content_elements":[{"_id":"Z4YX6UHJO5AWXHUWDLW7CVJFQA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"3FG4QSV6YJAWFOPRGZXCQCNR5A","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"ROANOKE, Va.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-16T17:51:28.268Z","location":"Roanoke
