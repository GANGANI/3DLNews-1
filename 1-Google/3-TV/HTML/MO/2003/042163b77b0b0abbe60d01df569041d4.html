He's been working as a reporter and multimedia journalist in Missouri for more than a decade. An avid photographer, he also shoots, writes and edits his own work, often with a unique style that has earned him recognition in the form of regional Emmy and Edward R. Murrow awards, as well as the National Press Photographers Association. \n\nVickers grew up in El Dorado Springs, Mo., where his family runs a small farm. He graduated from Truman State University, where he also played football. He got his start in broadcasting during a summer internship at KTVO, the ABC affiliate in Kirksville. That experience soon led him to another notable internship with the Late Show with David Letterman. Vickers also completed a graduate program at the Columbia University School of Journalism in New York City. \n\nAfter graduate school, he came home to the Midwest, landing a job at KOLR in Springfield, Mo., then at KCTV in Kansas City. After nearly a decade there, he moved to St. Louis to join KMOV in the fall of 2023. In his spare time, Vickers enjoys playing the piano and exploring the city on a bike. He is also a loyal Chiefs fan.

This, in turn, resulted in the passage of state legislation aimed at enhancing warehouse safety.\n\nHer in-depth reporting on crime and corruption has resulted in changes to city, county, and state policies.\n\nPrior to joining KMOV, Susan was the lead investigative reporter at KARK-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her investigation exposed the increasing use of PIT maneuvers by Arkansas State Police, which sometimes ended in deadly wrecks. Her work received international attention and instigated changes within the department, so the maneuvers now conform with deadly use of force policies.\n\nSusan's career started in Lansing, Michigan, where she was an anchor and reporter at WILX-TV.

You may remember Justin reporting mornings here at KMOV for more than 5 years. He returned as an anchor and reporter in September 2023.\n\nUpon leaving KMOV, Justin joined KPIX CBS News Bay Area as a magnetic addition to the morning team in San Francisco. He was part of launching the 5-hour “Morning Edition” newscasts where he anchored and reported. With a captivating on-screen presence, Justin etched his path as the unyielding lead morning reporter captivating viewers with live breaking news reports. Justin’s career has landed his live reporting on CNN, CBS This Morning, and HLN. His grit led him to being nominated for an Emmy for his reporting while working in the Bay Area. He also served on the Board of Governors for the San Francisco/Northern California EMMY chapter for nearly 2 years.\n\nJustin's storytelling prowess unfolded in the heartlands of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. There, he didn't just report stories; he became the advocate for those whose voices were drowned by adversity. Justin spent two years fearlessly uncovering tales that echoed across Iowa. In 2014, after the tragic death of a child who was swept away in a storm drain during major flooding, people wanted state leaders to cover the drains. With Justin's dogged and unwavering determination, state leaders in Iowa added covers over storm drains. \n\nJustin's journey through the world of journalism began in Kansas City, Missouri, where he cut his teeth as a morning producer and fill-in assignment desk editor. He also graced Kirksville, Missouri, as the weekend evening anchor, adding diverse hues to his journalistic palette.\n\nWith over 12 years of TV experience under his belt, Justin's heart now beats for the vibrancy of St. Louis. It's a dream come true, and he's ready to embrace it all. Beyond the screen, Justin is more than a journalist; he's a force for change. He mentors, he advocates, he stands for the truth. He's a church boy, a brunch aficionado, and an outdoor adventurer.\n\nIf you cross paths with Justin across St. Louis, don't hesitate to say hello! Engage with him, share a conversation, and witness what makes him a champion in wanting the typically unheard voices to be heard.","slug":"","instagram":"@Justin_EAndrews","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kmov","last_updated_date":"2023-12-06T17:31:28.229Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T20:39:13.732Z","description":{"basic":"2

You may remember Justin reporting mornings here at KMOV for more than 5 years. He returned as an anchor and reporter in September 2023.\n\nUpon leaving KMOV, Justin joined KPIX CBS News Bay Area as a magnetic addition to the morning team in San Francisco. He was part of launching the 5-hour “Morning Edition” newscasts where he anchored and reported. With a captivating on-screen presence, Justin etched his path as the unyielding lead morning reporter captivating viewers with live breaking news reports. Justin’s career has landed his live reporting on CNN, CBS This Morning, and HLN. His grit led him to being nominated for an Emmy for his reporting while working in the Bay Area. He also served on the Board of Governors for the San Francisco/Northern California EMMY chapter for nearly 2 years.\n\nJustin's storytelling prowess unfolded in the heartlands of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. There, he didn't just report stories; he became the advocate for those whose voices were drowned by adversity. Justin spent two years fearlessly uncovering tales that echoed across Iowa. In 2014, after the tragic death of a child who was swept away in a storm drain during major flooding, people wanted state leaders to cover the drains. With Justin's dogged and unwavering determination, state leaders in Iowa added covers over storm drains. \n\nJustin's journey through the world of journalism began in Kansas City, Missouri, where he cut his teeth as a morning producer and fill-in assignment desk editor. He also graced Kirksville, Missouri, as the weekend evening anchor, adding diverse hues to his journalistic palette.\n\nWith over 12 years of TV experience under his belt, Justin's heart now beats for the vibrancy of St. Louis. It's a dream come true, and he's ready to embrace it all. Beyond the screen, Justin is more than a journalist; he's a force for change. He mentors, he advocates, he stands for the truth. He's a church boy, a brunch aficionado, and an outdoor adventurer.\n\nIf you cross paths with Justin across St. Louis, don't hesitate to say hello! Engage with him, share a conversation, and witness what makes him a champion in wanting the typically unheard voices to be heard.","slug":"","instagram":"@Justin_EAndrews","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kmov","last_updated_date":"2023-12-06T17:31:28.229Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"6","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:50:56.398Z","description":{"basic":"The

During her time at WSAZ, Kimberly embodied the station's \"Making a Difference\" brand by helping viewers obtain landline phone access in rural areas, assisting in jumpstarting construction on treacherous roads and highlighting the struggles of those on Charleston's West Side during a nearly month-long natural gas outage at the start of winter 2023. \n\nKimberly is no stranger to the Midwest. She started her reporting career at our sister station, WIBW in Topeka, Kansas days into the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While in Kansas, Kimberly's reporting on a small town’s monthly gas bill during a cold snap prompted swift movement in the legislature to provide utility bill relief to more than 170 towns across the state.\n\nA graduate of Hofstra University, she credits the university’s radio station for emphasizing the importance of storytelling. \n\nKimberly is a proud Philadelphia native. When not working, you can find her scrapbooking, cheering on Philly sports or checking out local eateries.
