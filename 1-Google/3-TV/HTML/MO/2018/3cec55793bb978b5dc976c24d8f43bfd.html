She interned for a semester in the spring of 2010. She was hired in February 2011 as the web producer for County News, a hyper-local group of sites that branched off from KFVS12.com. Each of the 15 sites covered events and stories in one county in the Heartland.\n\nA little more than two years later, Amber became a digital content producer for KFVS12.com. Since then, she has been a digital content executive producer and now the digital content manager.\n\nAmber is a native of DeSoto, Mo.
