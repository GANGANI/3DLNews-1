During her time at WSAZ, Kimberly embodied the station's \"Making a Difference\" brand by helping viewers obtain landline phone access in rural areas, assisting in jumpstarting construction on treacherous roads and highlighting the struggles of those on Charleston's West Side during a nearly month-long natural gas outage at the start of winter 2023. \n\nKimberly is no stranger to the Midwest. She started her reporting career at our sister station, WIBW in Topeka, Kansas days into the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. While in Kansas, Kimberly's reporting on a small town’s monthly gas bill during a cold snap prompted swift movement in the legislature to provide utility bill relief to more than 170 towns across the state.\n\nA graduate of Hofstra University, she credits the university’s radio station for emphasizing the importance of storytelling. \n\nKimberly is a proud Philadelphia native.
