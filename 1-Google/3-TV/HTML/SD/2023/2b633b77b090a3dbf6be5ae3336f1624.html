He said that he initially saw himself as a potential candidate to challenge incumbent Secretary of State Steve Barnett at the 2022 state GOP convention.</p><p class="text | article-text">Then Weible and his wife, Gretchen, met Monae Johnson, a more palatable nominee because she previously worked in the secretary of state’s office.

She didn’t have room reservations. She had no T-shirts, no signs, no buttons. She wasn’t even totally sure of the rules of the convention.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Johnson declined an interview request with News Watch for this story. In response to a question about Weible, state elections director Rachel Soulek sent a statement that the secretary of state’s office is “constantly combatting misinformation and disinformation regarding elections. We encourage voters to turn to their trusted sources for election information, which are the Secretary of State’s Office and our county auditors.”</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Credit: SD News Watch" loading="lazy" src="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KNZAFWPEXJER5KWBBVVRIKPPO4.png?auth=1a952afb619522ce18ccba210b94d16bbd7f70cc51ae80d517c05411e7a054e9&amp;width=980&amp;height=673&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="673" srcSet="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KNZAFWPEXJER5KWBBVVRIKPPO4.png?auth=1a952afb619522ce18ccba210b94d16bbd7f70cc51ae80d517c05411e7a054e9&amp;width=540&amp;height=370&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KNZAFWPEXJER5KWBBVVRIKPPO4.png?auth=1a952afb619522ce18ccba210b94d16bbd7f70cc51ae80d517c05411e7a054e9&amp;width=720&amp;height=494&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KNZAFWPEXJER5KWBBVVRIKPPO4.png?auth=1a952afb619522ce18ccba210b94d16bbd7f70cc51ae80d517c05411e7a054e9&amp;width=980&amp;height=673&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KNZAFWPEXJER5KWBBVVRIKPPO4.png?auth=1a952afb619522ce18ccba210b94d16bbd7f70cc51ae80d517c05411e7a054e9&amp;width=1300&amp;height=892&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Credit: SD News Watch</span><span class="caption-credit">(South Dakota News Watch)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="text | article-text">Gretchen Weible became Johnson’s campaign manager and Rick served as adviser.

He heard concerns from his constituents about election vulnerabilities and kept an open mind.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“I was asked to give a presentation about voter fraud at a local grassroots organization called Citizens for Liberty,” said Lasseter. “I went and asked for any evidence that they had, and they said they didn’t have any evidence. But they asked me to watch the West River presentation from South Dakota Canvassing.”</p><p class="text | article-text">As he watched the slideshow and took notes on voter rolls and absentee ballots, Lasseter had serious questions about the validity of some of the findings.</p><p class="text | article-text">One slide showed a chart from Drazabot, a system designed to show the proportion of votes cast for each candidate&nbsp;as they’re recorded, much like the graphs used by Lindell to inaccurately claim fraud in several of Michigan’s statewide elections.</p><p class="text | article-text">The South Dakota chart was for Aurora County and showed GOP primary vote counts trending downward, with the caption: “Why Did Votes Go Down?” Rick Weible and Pollema said they had volunteers manually charting data from TotalVote, the state’s election management system, leaving the possibility of human error.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“If they had investigated the data, which was hand typed, they would have seen that someone transposed the numbers for that county,” Lasseter told News Watch. “The high number was actually accurate, and it is documented on the secretary of state website. So they either did not verify that the data was entered correctly, or they willfully allowed it to be presented in a way to make the public more concerned.”</p><h2 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>Voters ‘assured me they were not dead’</b></h2><p class="text | article-text">As for the group’s allegation that dead people were listed as South Dakota voters, Lasseter said he was given two names and addresses and looked them up on the voter rolls.</p><p class="text | article-text">“I called these people and they assured me they were not dead,” he told News Watch. “They also stated that they often get confused&nbsp;with their deceased father because once the father passed away, they no longer were a Junior.”</p><p class="text | article-text">None of this suggests that Lasseter doesn’t see flaws in the system. He advocated for legislation in Pierre that changed South Dakota’s voter residency requirement from one day to 30 days and served on Johnson’s summer study on post-election audits, hoping to bolster confidence in state and local voting results.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">He views Rick Weible and South Dakota Canvassing Group as partly responsible for eroding that confidence rather than bringing constructive dialogue to issues of election security.</p><p class="text | article-text">“It’s almost as if they’re trying to get people to follow something that can’t be proven,” Lasseter said. “There is some work to do, but the way they’re going about it is not going to fix any problems. It’s going to make people not want to listen to them.”</p><p class="text | article-text">McPherson County Auditor Lindley Howard, who serves on the South Dakota Board of Elections, echoed that sentiment from the standpoint of exasperated public officials.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Basically (the activists) are saying, ‘I’m a Christian, so I believe in election integrity, and you don’t agree with me, so you are doing Satan’s work,’” she said. “I would say that causes a lot of stress.”</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">The U.S. Department of Justice established a task force in 2021 to address “threats of violence against election workers, administrators, officials and volunteers.” The task force has charged 14 cases involving threats against the election community and secured nine convictions, none in South Dakota.</p><p class="text | article-text">Asked about public officials feeling pressured or overwhelmed while trying to perform election-related duties, Rick Weible dismissed those concerns.</p><p class="text | article-text">“I’m not responsible for how they feel, and I’m not sorry for that,” he said. “If they feel that way, I hope they’d be willing to sit down with us and do some due diligence to help get the facts out there. They’re just creating more work and wasting more time with all of the denials.”</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Rick Weible was a small-town mayor in Minnesota before moving to South Dakota to push for..." loading="lazy" src="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UHCXSYALIBFJTEH35ZDXTZR6ZU.jpg?auth=006cfad0fda0f9650e22f68b4c621d4b3b98cc95619941c6f8f0a1c2b5028bdf&amp;width=980&amp;height=628&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="628" srcSet="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UHCXSYALIBFJTEH35ZDXTZR6ZU.jpg?auth=006cfad0fda0f9650e22f68b4c621d4b3b98cc95619941c6f8f0a1c2b5028bdf&amp;width=540&amp;height=346&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UHCXSYALIBFJTEH35ZDXTZR6ZU.jpg?auth=006cfad0fda0f9650e22f68b4c621d4b3b98cc95619941c6f8f0a1c2b5028bdf&amp;width=720&amp;height=461&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UHCXSYALIBFJTEH35ZDXTZR6ZU.jpg?auth=006cfad0fda0f9650e22f68b4c621d4b3b98cc95619941c6f8f0a1c2b5028bdf&amp;width=980&amp;height=628&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UHCXSYALIBFJTEH35ZDXTZR6ZU.jpg?auth=006cfad0fda0f9650e22f68b4c621d4b3b98cc95619941c6f8f0a1c2b5028bdf&amp;width=1300&amp;height=833&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Rick Weible was a small-town mayor in Minnesota before moving to South Dakota to push for election reforms. “I was thinking, ‘If I can’t fix Minnesota, how can I get involved somewhere else to force some of these changes?’” he said.

The law established standards for federal elections through the Election Assistance Commission, paving the way for South Dakota to adopt automatic tabulating and electronic ballot marking as state law in 2005.</p><p class="text | article-text">Nelson, a Republican who was secretary of state from 2003 to 2011, worked with county auditors to choose optical scan ballots with high-speed counters as the standard for South Dakota.</p><p class="text | article-text">“One of the key reasons we went to that is because we have a paper backup,” said Nelson, who currently serves on the Public Utilities Commission.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“We’re going to use the high-speed counters so we can get a quick, accurate count on election night.

There’s no need for cast vote records.

That office backed up the counties, concluding that the “machine logs are not public records” based on state law.</p><p class="text | article-text">Anderson, the Minnehaha County auditor, criticized that assessment during a meeting with ES&amp;S officials at the company’s Omaha, Nebraska, headquarters in June 2023. The meeting was also attended by Secretary of State Johnson, state elections director Soulek, and Republican state legislators Sue Peterson of Sioux Falls, Tina Mulally of Rapid City and Rebecca Reimer of Chamberlain.</p><p class="text | article-text">After ES&amp;S officials explained that some places do release cast vote records but those decisions are based on the legal authority of states and counties, Anderson pushed back.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“My state’s attorney can give me their opinion,” she said, according to a transcript of the meeting. “But if it’s determined (elsewhere) to be public record and there is nothing proprietary and it does not identify a voter … there’s some miscommunication there.”</p><p class="text | article-text">“Obviously we can’t provide you with legal advice,” the ES&amp;S official said.</p><h2 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>County auditor touts hand counts</b></h2><p class="text | article-text">Anderson also voiced her support at the meeting for hand counting and less reliance on election technology.

And I know a lot of people that can count. One plus one. I mean, you’re counting. You’re marking.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Anderson confirmed to News Watch that she sees hand counting as a viable alternative to machine tabulators in Minnehaha County, which has nearly 133,000 registered voters.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Hand counting was the previous method of tabulation before the machines were brought into the state,” she said. “If precincts are kept at a workable level and the people we serve are willing to step up and work the elections, it is very scalable and can be done in public.”</p><h2 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>Machine found mistake humans didn’t</b></h2><p class="text | article-text">Tripp County, with 3,500 registered voters, became the first South Dakota county in nearly two decades to use a hand count in November 2022, with its county commission overruling the auditor.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">On election night, a discrepancy between the number of ballots recorded in the poll book and the number of audited ballots in one precinct became a mystery until the tabulator diagnosed the problem.</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Credit: SD News Watch" loading="lazy" src="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/O6NVKZKYH5FHVO6FMZR3PPXKUI.png?auth=bc060361987e86c0451d7694660306a612dea275803d72380105b6570627cc7a&amp;width=980&amp;height=622&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="622" srcSet="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/O6NVKZKYH5FHVO6FMZR3PPXKUI.png?auth=bc060361987e86c0451d7694660306a612dea275803d72380105b6570627cc7a&amp;width=540&amp;height=342&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/O6NVKZKYH5FHVO6FMZR3PPXKUI.png?auth=bc060361987e86c0451d7694660306a612dea275803d72380105b6570627cc7a&amp;width=720&amp;height=456&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/O6NVKZKYH5FHVO6FMZR3PPXKUI.png?auth=bc060361987e86c0451d7694660306a612dea275803d72380105b6570627cc7a&amp;width=980&amp;height=622&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/O6NVKZKYH5FHVO6FMZR3PPXKUI.png?auth=bc060361987e86c0451d7694660306a612dea275803d72380105b6570627cc7a&amp;width=1300&amp;height=825&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Credit: SD News Watch</span><span class="caption-credit">(South Dakota News Watch)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="text | article-text">“The machine caught it,” Tripp County Auditor Barb Desersa&nbsp;<a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2022/11/15/tripps-missing-ballots-human-error-goes-unchecked-until-tabulator-catches-mistake-post-election/?ref=sdnewswatch.org">told South Dakota Searchlight</a>. “To me, that shows that the machine is more accurate than humans.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Howard, the McPherson County auditor, said she spoke with precinct workers from the days when South Dakota still did hand counts.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">They painted a grim picture.</p><p class="text | article-text">“They shared stories of long ballots, long hours and fatigue,” said Howard. “These days, we create test decks to test the tabulators before every election, and my experience of hand-counting those small number of test ballots tells me that hand counting is not accurate.

Expanding mechanisms such as mail-in voting, online registration and drop boxes to maintain social distancing triggered backlash from Republicans, who accused liberal reformers of taking advantage of the pandemic to change policies.</p><p class="text | article-text">“A lot of Democrats took the position of not wasting an emergency to try to further a whole bunch of reforms that have been part of their playbook for a long time,” said Stewart, director of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Republicans began to see how some of these could move past emergency status and into something permanent, and the issue became polarized and has remained so ever since. That’s unfortunate because it’s led to some of the things you’re seeing in South Dakota.”</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Drop boxes, used in nearly 40 states in 2020, became a target for electoral activists after more than 40% of voters used the boxes to return ballots in that presidential election year, compared with about 15% in 2016.</p><p class="text | article-text">A movie praised by Trump, “2000 Mules,” purported to show a pattern of Democrat-aligned ballot “mules” paid to illegally collect and drop off ballots in swing states. Election experts criticized the project’s flawed cellphone tracking analysis, while Trump’s efforts to establish ballot fraud through the court system proved unsuccessful due to lack of evidence.</p><h2 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>‘State legislators are not experts’</b></h2><p class="text | article-text">Rick Weible and others encouraged South Dakota legislators to act, which resulted in a 2023 law stating that county auditors “may not establish or place … an absentee ballot drop box within the official’s jurisdiction. A completed absentee ballot may only be returned to an office of the individual in charge of the election.”</p><p class="text | article-text">The Board of Elections approved language clarifying that to mean ballots can only be returned to the physical office of the election official, as opposed to the lobby of a county building where the office is located.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Pennington County, the state’s second-largest county, has utilized a drop box in the foyer of the administration building in Rapid City.</p><p class="text | article-text">“The box is in a locked area and then the box itself is locked. And only the auditor’s office has a key to that box,” said Pennington County Auditor Cindy Mohler. “In Pennington, (the new law) really did nothing more than remove a convenient way for voters to return their ballots during non-business hours or return their ballot without having to come all the way into the building.”</p><p class="text | article-text">South Dakota did not record a single case of voter fraud or other election-related crimes tied to the use of ballot drop boxes in 2020 or 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sdnewswatch.org/south-dakota-county-auditors-disagree-election-drop-box-ban/">according to an April 2023 News Watch survey&nbsp;</a>that drew responses from 58 of 66 counties, including 29 of the top 30 by population.</p><p class="text | article-text">Several auditors expressed the belief that lawmakers got caught up in the rhetoric of alleged voter fraud without understanding the process in South Dakota, where signed return envelopes are cross-checked with signatures on ballot applications and can be tracked. Many auditors also noted that drop boxes have a more secure chain of custody than mailboxes, which are still permissible.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“Election administration as a policy area is like just about every other policy area in that the public and even state legislators are not experts,” said Stewart.</p><p class="text | article-text">“So they form opinions based on things they heard from friends and others within their own models of the world. And if their model of the world says that Democrats are out there trying to round up illegal ballots and throw them into drop boxes, they’re probably not going to be persuaded otherwise, which means certain innovations and best practices will be off the table.”</p><h2 class="header | article-header w-100"><b>‘I need to see actual proof’</b></h2><p class="text | article-text">Rapid City lawyer Scott McGregor, a Democratic appointee to the Board of Elections, said that Rick Weible raises interesting points on some issues but loses perspective on others, including tossing around the word “fraud” too recklessly.</p><p class="text | article-text">Fraud is a criminal term to describe actions such as forging a signature, while many discrepancies in voter rolls are the result of residents failing to update their registration. Mail-forwarding businesses that allow hundreds of temporary residents – many of them retirees in RVs – to use a common address led to a change in residency requirements in South Dakota, despite possible conflicts with federal law and no evidence that people were voting in more than one place.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">“I need to see actual proof from the South Dakota experience, not from some other jurisdiction that may have encountered some problems,” said McGregor. “And I haven’t seen it. I think (Rick Weible) would be better off choosing one or two issues to focus on. Sometimes he comes on too strong with objections and comments on everything, and it affects his credibility.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Rick Weible has a theory about folds in mail-in ballots that he claims caused discrepancies in machine counts in states such as Georgia, where Trump lost by 11,779 votes. Rick Weible does not believe that Biden won the state, though the election was certified, federal courts rejected challenges and Trump was arrested on state charges that he conspired to overturn the results.</p><p class="text | article-text">“In 2020, where there was such a high propensity of absentee ballots, I’ll tell you this: Trump filed the wrong lawsuit in Georgia,” Weible said. “He only inspected two counties. If he had inspected them all, he would have crossed the finish line.”</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Caps for sale at a South Dakota Canvassing Group event at the Military Heritage Alliance in..." loading="lazy" src="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XW36NXZJINAC3ITTEZ36D3LJBE.jpg?auth=0a8497d527c2fab7ed5fd5889f3c6b1462903104429383e0ad4e8d1574a26c41&amp;width=980&amp;height=673&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="673" srcSet="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XW36NXZJINAC3ITTEZ36D3LJBE.jpg?auth=0a8497d527c2fab7ed5fd5889f3c6b1462903104429383e0ad4e8d1574a26c41&amp;width=540&amp;height=370&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XW36NXZJINAC3ITTEZ36D3LJBE.jpg?auth=0a8497d527c2fab7ed5fd5889f3c6b1462903104429383e0ad4e8d1574a26c41&amp;width=720&amp;height=494&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XW36NXZJINAC3ITTEZ36D3LJBE.jpg?auth=0a8497d527c2fab7ed5fd5889f3c6b1462903104429383e0ad4e8d1574a26c41&amp;width=980&amp;height=673&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XW36NXZJINAC3ITTEZ36D3LJBE.jpg?auth=0a8497d527c2fab7ed5fd5889f3c6b1462903104429383e0ad4e8d1574a26c41&amp;width=1300&amp;height=892&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Caps for sale at a South Dakota Canvassing Group event at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls, S.D., on Oct. 19, 2023.

I don’t think this is going to die down in 2024.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Stewart’s research bears that out nationally, especially with Trump dominating primary polls. There’s enough resentment to allow people like Rick Weible to wield the rhetorical style of pedantry, defined as the quality of being overly interested in formal rules and small details that are not ultimately important.</p><figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img"><img class="figure-img img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Credit: SD News Watch" loading="lazy" src="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RMJPDSSBYJG75FK5FCDLQA4CEQ.png?auth=7d2c0dc7efdb37a583b2b6db1d4baa30f2979d70a3ab967363a1d616f332ac12&amp;width=980&amp;height=692&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="692" srcSet="https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RMJPDSSBYJG75FK5FCDLQA4CEQ.png?auth=7d2c0dc7efdb37a583b2b6db1d4baa30f2979d70a3ab967363a1d616f332ac12&amp;width=540&amp;height=381&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RMJPDSSBYJG75FK5FCDLQA4CEQ.png?auth=7d2c0dc7efdb37a583b2b6db1d4baa30f2979d70a3ab967363a1d616f332ac12&amp;width=720&amp;height=508&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RMJPDSSBYJG75FK5FCDLQA4CEQ.png?auth=7d2c0dc7efdb37a583b2b6db1d4baa30f2979d70a3ab967363a1d616f332ac12&amp;width=980&amp;height=692&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-ksfy-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/RMJPDSSBYJG75FK5FCDLQA4CEQ.png?auth=7d2c0dc7efdb37a583b2b6db1d4baa30f2979d70a3ab967363a1d616f332ac12&amp;width=1300&amp;height=917&amp;smart=true 1300w"/></div><figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"><span class="caption-text">Credit: SD News Watch</span><span class="caption-credit">(South Dakota News Watch)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="text | article-text">“People who use this style like to focus on fine points of law or administrative process to show they are experts, talking about things like cast vote records and elements of election administration,” said Stewart. “To someone uninitiated who shows up at a church gathering or Holiday Inn meeting room, this person might sound like he knows what he’s talking about.

He was looking for proof. Kloucek said he has seen election improprieties in small-town South Dakota precincts but is dismayed that anyone can think Trump was the victim of a vast election conspiracy.</p><p class="text | article-text">“They’ve got to face facts,” he said, gesturing back at the crowd. “Biden won the popular vote by 7 million and had 306 electoral votes. They can’t overturn that. I don’t have a problem with some of the stuff they’re talking about, but too many of them can’t face the fact that Trump lost and that’s where a lot of this is coming from. It’s time to wake up.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Kloucek pulled out a bumper sticker that said, “Biden Won! Democracy Wins!” that he didn’t have a chance to give Rick Weible after the presentation.
