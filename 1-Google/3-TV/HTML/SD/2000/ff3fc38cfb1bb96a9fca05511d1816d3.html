That was when he started to invest his time on stage, performing in musicals heavily and plays for the school theater program. Ever since then, Humberto began to realize that he liked performing, and better yet, liked having people see the art that he was making. \n\nFast forward to his college years. Humberto was stuck trying to find what he wanted to do for the first two years of his undergraduate education, he took two journalism classes for the heck of it. Come to find out, that's when he began to realize that he liked telling the stories of people who made an impact on the \"local\" community, no matter how small that impact may be. \n\nThe biggest question he gets while interviewing somebody is: Why does he care? His answer: If I don't, then who will? This has been a constant thought process in his work since he graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022. Being able to work with the surrounding community, whatever the town, city, or municipality, it doesn't matter; to have the chance to talk and tell the stories of the people who live there is his goal as a reporter… as a journalist.\n\nFeel free to reach out with story ideas, food place suggestions, or hidden gems of the Black Hills.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kota","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-05-28T20:52:05.544Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10","languages":"English, Spanish"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T04:29:24.004Z","description":{"basic":"Their journey started with a smoker grill three years ago, cooking up food during the rally.

Growing up, he feared talking in public, but that all changed in his junior year of high school. That was when he started to invest his time on stage, performing in musicals heavily and plays for the school theater program. Ever since then, Humberto began to realize that he liked performing, and better yet, liked having people see the art that he was making. \n\nFast forward to his college years. Humberto was stuck trying to find what he wanted to do for the first two years of his undergraduate education, he took two journalism classes for the heck of it. Come to find out, that's when he began to realize that he liked telling the stories of people who made an impact on the \"local\" community, no matter how small that impact may be. \n\nThe biggest question he gets while interviewing somebody is: Why does he care? His answer: If I don't, then who will? This has been a constant thought process in his work since he graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022. Being able to work with the surrounding community, whatever the town, city, or municipality, it doesn't matter; to have the chance to talk and tell the stories of the people who live there is his goal as a reporter… as a journalist.\n\nFeel free to reach out with story ideas, food place suggestions, or hidden gems of the Black

Skilled at conversing live coupled with her quick wit, Alena entered the spotlight when she became Co-Host of Clear Channel’s “Stacey and Alena on Progressive Talk 1260” and then worked really hard to become Host of WPGC 95.5FM, CBS Radio’s “Alena7’s All Access” where she hosted, edited and produced her own daily video show.\n\nAlena was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and moved to Washington, D.C. after being selected to attend the famed Duke Ellington School of the Arts High School in Georgetown, DC. This youngest daughter of Cape Verdean heritage (African & Portuguese ethnicity), Alena credits her mother for inspiring her to be all that she could be despite any odds. “I have grown to be familiar with a striving through strife mindset because of a strong foundation rooted in family and educational values. These brief but significant attributes have naturally inspired me to become a voice to the voiceless, a beacon of hope to the hopeless and a resource for all others.”\n\nAfter graduating from Duke Ellington, Alena went on to study Communications and Fine Arts at Howard University. She became Miss DC USA 1993 representing the nation’s capital in the Miss USA pageant live on CBS from Wichita, Kansas. Alena began acting & working in broadcasting in the late 1990’s. After completing her reign as Miss DC USA, she moved to Los Angeles and began snagging roles in the tv business. Alena got her first opportunity to perform when she was cast on the sitcom, “Sister Sister”. Guest work continued in other comedy series like “Between Brothers”, “The Mike Hammer Show” on the TNT network before landing a recurring role on “NYPD BLUE”. While in Los Angeles, Alena became a guest reporter on BET’s popular entertainment show, entitled “Screen Scene”. Alena is the proud mom to twins, Alana and PJ.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kevn","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4","last_updated_date":"2023-11-22T19:07:46.300Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T15:44:27.082Z","description":{"basic":"Pride Month is kicked off every year in June to celebrate the power of the LGBTQ+ community and highlight their activism."},"headlines":{"basic":"Come out and support the Black Hills’ first-ever Pride Parade June 1","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/gKP86SO4YUfLJkVmy3VMRKQWOfo=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","galleries":[],"keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"t_578ac2513cbd4d8ab628be2abfb112e6_name_file_1280x720_2000_v3_1_.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/gKP86SO4YUfLJkVmy3VMRKQWOfo=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/gKP86SO4YUfLJkVmy3VMRKQWOfo=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/a8eBjPJsVr0wJ9hjlzuS1pM6ia8=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","version":0},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"c55bde1e77fb7516e065b1660dde08014bcd750ea78b709221e93de364e40ae0"},"caption":"Pride Month is kicked off every year in June to celebrate the power of the LGBTQ+ community and highlight their activism.","created_date":"2024-05-29T15:36:52Z","height":720,"last_updated_date":"2024-05-29T15:36:52Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray"},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Come out and support the Black Hills first-ever Pride Parade on Saturday","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/LGNFBYR4ZZB57LSCP6JU2J4TDA.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"imageId":null,"ingestImageToAnglerfish":true,"photographer":null,"usage_instructions":null},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"kevn":{"website_section":{"path":"/news/morning","_website":"kevn","name":"Morning","_id":"/news/morning","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/29/come-out-support-black-hills-first-ever-pride-parade-saturday/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"kevn","websites":{"kevn":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news/morning","_website":"kevn","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Morning","path":"/news/morning","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/morning","site":{"site_title":"Good Morning Black Hills"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Good Morning Black Hills"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/morning"},"_website":"kevn","name":"Morning","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1032,"navigation-menu-links":1006},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/"},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"kevn./news/morning"},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/come-out-support-black-hills-first-ever-pride-parade-june-1/"}},"_id":"HDPEHGRXUBA5HCMDB4LQTG3U2M","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/news/morning","_website":"kevn","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Morning","path":"/news/morning","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/morning","site":{"site_title":"Good Morning Black Hills"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Good Morning Black Hills"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/morning"},"_website":"kevn","name":"Morning","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1032,"navigation-menu-links":1006},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/"},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"kevn./news/morning"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/come-out-support-black-hills-first-ever-pride-parade-june-1/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/29/post-22-sweeps-doubleheader-sturgis/","content_elements":[{"_id":"V2EPGOMNPBBQ7GTCBKOE26DUOE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1716959390481,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"RAPID CITY, S.D.
