I didn't have a pass and Johnny loaned me one of his, after walking around for a few hours, the security came up to me and said, "You don't look like Johnny Cole" and escorted me to the tent and out the gate.

Let me just say that none of the stories we covered were ever boring, the main reason, the car rides along the way.</p><p class="text | article-text">Johnny would NEVER let me drive.  According to Johnny, women didn't need to drive if there was a man present.  Always the gentleman, he would never tell me the real reason he didn't like women drivers.  Needless to say he was always a gentleman and I do mean that from the bottom of my heart.</p><p class="text | article-text">A typical day behind the wheel with Johnny would always start the same. News would break out over the scanner and it would be moments before I would hear his distinct voice.  "NIKKI! NIKKI! GOOD LORD O'L MIGHTY WHERE ARE YOU WOMAN?!" His voice would boom across the newsroom. "DARL'N GRAB THAT CAMERA OF YOURS AND LETS GET ON WITH IT!"</p><p class="text | article-text">He always had his hand stretched out.  To me, this meant handing over my keys and to start praying, for I knew in the next 15 minutes, my life would be in the hands of this man. After hustling out to the carport, he'd open the car door for me, and in classic Johnny form he would always say, "Okay woman! Sit down and strap yourself in because I'm taking the wheel behind this car so you better hang on!"  Just as I would hear my seatbelt click into the locked position, smoke would start roasting from the back tires. As Johnny slammed the gears into drive, and his foot on the gas, my head would always snap back right before our news car launched out of the WTOC parking lot.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">We would spend countless trips blazing down one of Chatham County's many streets in route to catch up with the latest breaking news.   As an avid NASCAR fan, I would see Johnny's facial expression.  It was as if he was fantasizing being on an actual racetrack. With the peddle to the metal he would send our little news car sailing through the air every time we hit any sort of bump on the road. I can't even begin to tell you what driving down River Street was like with Johnny behind the wheel.  Keep in mind our trips down River Street were back when it was still legal to drive in both directions and a train still passed down it. The number of Hail Mary prayers I was able to knock off, whenever Johnny turned the car down one of the many ramps, amazed me.</p><p class="text | article-text">Why I never jumped out of the car in hopes of saving my own life is still a mystery to me.  My guess is that no matter where we were going and no matter how fast Johnny sped to get us there; I did in fact trust him.  I trusted him with every ounce of my being.</p><p class="text | article-text">Johnny Cole was one of a kind.  If I had to go back in time, I'd do it in a heartbeat if it meant being able to take one more ride with him.</p><p class="text | article-text">Rest in Peace my goodfella!  You will be missed.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Nicole Teigen<br/>Former Videographer/Reporter WTOC 1999-2006</p><p class="text | article-text">________________________</p><p class="text | article-text">I worked with Johnny from 1997 until he retired. He was the reason I worked at WTOC and I will always be grateful for the time I worked with him. Johnny could be tough on you, especially if you messed up on the teleprompter. If you did, you knew a flying pencil would be on the way.</p><p class="text | article-text">Johnny married my best friend's mother so I got to spend time with Johnny outside of work.

During his Skipper Jack days, Johnny would film historic sites all over Savannah. When he was filming at Fort Pulaski one day, our Tybee Girl Scout troop was there and he asked us to be in the segment. He then would call us and ask us to go to the various sites with him and act as tour guide. He then would give me some insight into the site, and would have me handle the tour. At the end of the year, he presented us with a copy of all of the segments.</p><p class="text | article-text">As a Freshman at St. Vincent's, I was required to obtain a lock of Skipper Jack's hair as part of the Senior/Freshman initiation. I wrote Johnny a letter requesting this. Johnny wrote me back stating that he didn't have enough hair to share, but would an autographed picture of Skipper Jack work?   When he covered the goings on at Tybee for WTOC, we became reacquainted. I used to kid him and call him Skipper Jack. I reminded him of the photo he sent and that I still had it 20 some years later. The next time he came by City Hall, I had it hanging in my office. I still have that picture today.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Skipper Jack, you were my hero.

I was only in a marina shirt and my underwear!</p><p class="text | article-text">I wish to thank everyone for the great outpouring of sympathy our family has recieved.

'Till next week, I'm Johnny Cole."</p><p class="text | article-text">After his retirement, he moved to Bulloch County and opened a bait store and BBQ joint.  So star struck, me and my friend Stephen rode bikes all the way from Stilson to HWY 46 one day to meet the legend and have a sandwich.  What a nice guy he was.  To a couple of 15-year-olds, he was a legend, the most famous person we had ever met.</p><p class="text | article-text">We chatted about fishing, good barbecue and where we were from. Once we told him how far we had ridden, he quizzed, "do your folks know that you came here?"  Upon telling him no, he encouraged us to head home safely.  He did however, invite us back any time we wanted to come (by car of course).</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">I've missed Johnny on TV since his retirement.  His store closed long ago as well.  Like so many others, he fell victim to a horrible diesease.  Cancer does not discriminate it seems.   I like to think that now Johnny is along the banks of the eternal celestial fresh water fishing hole, sharing fishing tips with my grandfather and others.  I hear the bream are biting crickets and the catfish are hitting pinks on the bottom Johnny.</p><p class="text | article-text">While I don't fish as often as I'd like these days, I've still kept away from the drugs.  I'll never forget you.  God bless you sir.</p><p class="text | article-text">Alex Grovenstein <br/>Stilson, GA</p><p class="text | article-text">________________________</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Back in the early 90's, Mr. Cole came to Glennville for the annual "Get Hooked on Fishin Not Drugs" tournament for young children.  Our son Jarrod was around 5-years-old.

Two of Savannah's best-known faces and a pair of great buds who should've made a "road picture" together.  There was Doug's smiling face surrounded by a halo of silver and Johnny with a sideway smile in his Skipper Jack cap. And the two would go round and round and get nowhere.</p><p class="text | article-text">A small tribute, in my mind, to two long-time buddies who were at their best when trying to one-upsmanship the other.   I don't think many people knew this, but off camera they were a hybrid of Hope and Crosby, Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis and even Thelma and Louise. Throw in the late Jim Hildebrandt and you had the Three Stooges Gold Edition.</p><p class="text | article-text">Johnny griped a lot. But he was always much more generous, and a pat on the back was like winning an Oscar. He might yell, but he was not afraid to say "good job". You had to WORK for it, but he would give it to you.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Made the best. Incredible man.

He asked if he could borrow it and told me to make sure I watched the noon news the next day and lo-and-behold, Johnny put the picture on the news so she was the first in what turned out to be hundreds of kids shown on the noon news with their first fish.</p><p class="text | article-text">I will never forget Johnny Cole.</p><p class="text | article-text">Nancy A.

Getting up for PT and watching THE News at Daybreak, with Johnny Cole and Jody Chapin, was like catching up with old friends about what was happening in our area.<br/></p><p class="text | article-text">Johnny and Jody were great together, almost magical.

So much so, that we made our home here in the Coastal Empire! Never got to meet you, but, we love and miss you!</p><p class="text | article-text">Jackie and Ardell Farr</p><p class="text | article-text">________________________</p><p class="text | article-text">I met Johnny in 1972 when I joined the Savannah chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Association. I was a new student pilot at Savannah Air Service. He was a commercial rated pilot and a licensed flight instructor.  He was also in the process of building an experimental aircraft in his workshop at his home in south Savannah (near Thunderbolt). I believe it was a Fly Baby, powered by a modified Volkswagon automobile engine. He and Robin Brown, a Viet Nam veteran Cobra pilot turned flight instructor, talked me into going over to Hopeton Plantion Airfield (a 1,700' grass strip on Hubert Kellers farm) to fly "real" airplanes.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Robin taught me to fly and soloed me in the Aeronca Champ (taildragger) and then I bought a Cessna 170 (larger taildragger). Johnny took over and led me through the upgrade to the 170. He was one cool character! I can still see his face as I danced the 170 down the runway at Travis Field on one wheel with the wing inches off the pavement in a crosswind landing. After I got three wheels firmly down, he calmly said "let's do that again, three wheels this time! OK? We spent some very happy hours together in the air as he honed my skills as a pilot.</p><p class="text | article-text">One day we were out over Daufuskie at about 3000' and I was "under the hood" practicing instrument flying (able to see only the instrument panel) and Johnny said "Parker take off the hood, you've gotta see this"! We were between broken cloud layers and the sun was shining through the breaks in a way I've never seen, before or since. It was as if we passed through a small corner of Heaven. Johnny saw and felt it and wanted me to share it.</p><p class="text | article-text">As a CFI he signed me off to take the FAA flight test for Private Pilot. I passed the test on the first try, solely because of the patience and skill of Johnny Cole. And, yes, he finished and flew the Fly Baby many times until a minor mishap during a landing at Hopeton.</p><p class="text | article-text">I sold the 170 in 1974 because of a career change and have not flown since. After that I never saw Johnny except on WTOC but always had a deep respect for him. I had been thinking of looking him up just recently but didn't get to. He was truly a character, with CHARACTER!</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">I know all of you at WTOC will miss him greatly.

I started running fishing charters when I was about 15 year old. During this time frame the United States Coast Guard respectfully requested that I obtain "letters of competence" from persons qualified to attest to my abilities. Johnny Cole was one of the first to step forward to compose a letter and sign on the dotted line. This letter became part of the documents that were in my file, which was labeled "the illegal captain!"</p><p class="text | article-text">Over the years Johnny and I worked together on many things from television to fishing. One day Johnny Cole became "Captain Cole" and became a member of "Miss Judy Charters Fishing Team." He bought himself a boat to which he named "Miss Molly." It was a great 24-foot boat with inshore and near shore capabilities. He fixed her up in "Johnny Cole Style!" During this time frame, he took many interesting people fishing. Occasionally he was asked to just take customers on plain boat rides! I remember this one time in particular where he was asked to take a young just married "good looking" couple out for ride through the Intracoastal Waterway. The chartered boat ride started out normal. However, I wouldn't be mentioning this if that were the case. About one hour into the "sunny day riding affair" the couple asked, "Could they sun in the nude?" Captain Cole, even though this was exciting, wasn't sure exactly how to answer, but it came out anyhow, "yes of course!" According to the story, at least Captain Cole's version, "clothes started flying off!" As Johnny made his way down the waterway, not trying to look, while passing under one of Turner Creek bridges his wife at the time caught a glimpse of the "bare facts!" You know the old saying, "news travels fast, but real good news flies faster than the news man!" The only way that I can correctly sum this story up is to report the facts: Everyone everywhere knew before Captain Cole returned back to the dock! The phones were ringing and the VHF radios were humming! Some one should have taken a picture!</p><p class="text | article-text">Then there was this time when Captain Cole was "taking a personal fishing holiday!" He and a small group had decided to head out to the beachfront so as to do a little Spanish and king mackerel fishing. The fishing trip turned out great with all on deck catching quite a few fish. When all were tired, including Captain Cole, sights were set for home, as Captain Cole rounded "red marker 16" in Warsaw Sound he lined up with "red marker 20." Had it not been real low tide this story would have not needed to be told! As he made his way at 21 knots and as soon as the "Miss Molly" ran out of water she grounded on the sand bar. The good news was that no one was hurt and the boat wasn't damaged! However, navigator Captain Cole called up the powers that be and strongly suggested that another navigational aid be placed between the two red markers. It didn't take long before the Coast Guard buoy tender made way to the area and placed the badly needed day marker. From this day the navigational aid became known as and is still called the "Johnny Cole Marker!"</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">My first mate of over thirty years Captain Ali Young and Captain Cole had an understanding. They both basically said what they thought and thought what they said was "right on!" However, the bad news is that I can't print many of the subjects that they talked about! So I will do what I do best, which is tell most of the facts. He was forever asking Captain Ali, which he always referred to as "Miss Turner Creek," questions that he knew he couldn't use the answers on the air. However, the show always went on, but the tape was never used!</p><p class="text | article-text">I could go on and on with great stories about my wonderful Johnny Cole. I would just like to say, "if there wasn't a Johnny, many a smile and laugh would have been lost for sure!" Many will miss Johnny Cole! I bet he has "got a big fish hooked up right now!"</p><p class="text | article-text">Captain Judy Helmey of Miss Judy Charters</p><p class="text | article-text">________________________</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">I remember Johnny Cole quite well. As a retired officer of the Savannah Police Deptartment, I made contect with Johnny a number of times.</p><p class="text | article-text">I found him to be very good at his job. If a police officer had a case of interest, he knew he could contact Johnny any time of day or night. Johnny was a reporter that could always be trusted. He would report the story as the officer wanted it reported.</p><p class="text | article-text">I visited Johnny in the hospital just before his death and had a very good visit with him.

I was a new student pilot at Savannah Air Service. He was a commercial rated pilot and a licensed flight instructor.  He was also in the process of building an experimental aircraft in his workshop at his home in south Savannah (near Thunderbolt). I believe it was a Fly Baby, powered by a modified Volkswagon automobile engine. He and Robin Brown, a Viet Nam veteran Cobra pilot turned flight instructor, talked me into going over to Hopeton Plantion Airfield (a 1,700' grass strip on Hubert Kellers farm) to fly \"real\" airplanes."},{"_id":"5ACJELRN7FAP3GCZPSKAGTABDE","type":"text","content":"Robin taught me to fly and soloed me in the Aeronca Champ (taildragger) and then I bought a Cessna 170 (larger taildragger).

One day Johnny Cole became \"Captain Cole\" and became a member of \"Miss Judy Charters Fishing Team.\" He bought himself a boat to which he named \"Miss Molly.\" It was a great 24-foot boat with inshore and near shore capabilities. He fixed her up in \"Johnny Cole Style!\" During this time frame, he took many interesting people fishing. Occasionally he was asked to just take customers on plain boat rides! I remember this one time in particular where he was asked to take a young just married \"good looking\" couple out for ride through the Intracoastal Waterway. The chartered boat ride started out normal. However, I wouldn't be mentioning this if that were the case. About one hour into the \"sunny day riding affair\" the couple asked, \"Could they sun in the nude?\" Captain Cole, even though this was exciting, wasn't sure exactly how to answer, but it came out anyhow, \"yes of course!\" According to the story, at least Captain Cole's version, \"clothes started flying off!\" As Johnny made his way down the waterway, not trying to look, while passing under one of Turner Creek bridges his wife at the time caught a glimpse of the \"bare facts!\" You know the old saying, \"news travels fast, but real good news flies faster than the news man!\" The only way that I can correctly sum this story up is to report the facts: Everyone everywhere knew before Captain Cole returned back to the dock!

As he made his way at 21 knots and as soon as the \"Miss Molly\" ran out of water she grounded on the sand bar. The good news was that no one was hurt and the boat wasn't damaged! However, navigator Captain Cole called up the powers that be and strongly suggested that another navigational aid be placed between the two red markers. It didn't take long before the Coast Guard buoy tender made way to the area and placed the badly needed day marker.
