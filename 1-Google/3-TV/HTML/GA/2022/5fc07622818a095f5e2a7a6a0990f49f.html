She is looking forward to covering issues that impact all Georgians for Atlanta News First and all of the Gray stations in Georgia. \n\nOriginally from Baltimore, Maryland, Abby fell in love with the Peach State on a college visit and committed to The University of Georgia shortly after. Abby graduated from UGA with a journalism and political science degree. \n\nShe started her career in Macon, Georgia where she was a political reporter for 13WMAZ.\n\nWhile in Central Georgia, Abby covered the Macon-Bibb county commission. Her stories shed a light on violations brought against officials, officer shortages, and efforts to address the blight problems.\n\nAfter 2 years in Macon, Abby moved to Knoxville, Tennessee to report for WVLT. In the 3 years that Abby was there, she reported on weekdays and anchored the weekend morning show. \n\nOne of the most notable stories Abby covered while in Knoxville was the devastating wildfire in Wears Valley. The wildfire spread across thousands of acres within a matter of days. 24 hours news updates kept people away from the area before it was safe to return. \n\nWhen she’s not reporting, Abby is probably hiking, cooking, or cheering on the Georgia Bulldawgs!","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-04-18T15:25:49.879Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"22","custom_gray_stationname":"wgcl","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","location":"Atlanta News First"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T20:59:31.793Z","description":{"basic":"The consumer protection groups published a 40-page report on why they feel the project is bad for people living in Georgia."},"headlines":{"basic":"Georgia consumer groups slam Plant Vogtle project in new report  ","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/9Cj0nGeBcF3pMYRd3d0ydWJUlpA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"WCK_4897_master2.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4.jpg","owner":"steven.byerly@wrdw.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/9Cj0nGeBcF3pMYRd3d0ydWJUlpA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/9Cj0nGeBcF3pMYRd3d0ydWJUlpA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/-o1YKBP8RcYVoqm5GHK5Ql9zWTM=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCWM6TE3TBFBJIUSBSZOQHKHO4.jpg","usage_instructions":"Free to use","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"11434d8239687a4089b05e733cfafc6567eed70fa7f94efb5f49a2f02a18bb3d"},"caption":"FILE -

Ella fell in love with weather at the age of 4 when her dad gave her a Discovery Channel VCR titled “Tornado, Hurricane, Flood”.\n\nHer passion shines through in her forecasts. In addition to weather, Ella is a HUGE football fan. She made regular appearances on sports-radio talk shows in Knoxville. You can spot her sporting Baltimore Ravens & Georgia Bulldogs gear year-round. If she isn’t watching radar or football, you can find her cooking or traveling.\n\nShe previously worked for WBIR-TV in Knoxville Tennessee where she covered everything from tornadoes to snow and ice storms.

She is thrilled to be back home in Atlanta!\n\nChelsea grew up in Cobb County and graduated cum laude from The University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism. From there she moved to Macon, Georgia where she was the weekend anchor and an investigative reporter at 13WMAZ.\n\nWhile in Central Georgia Chelsea reported on dozens of cold cases, the fluctuating homicide rate in Macon-Bibb County, and the 14-year long murder mystery of South Georgia teacher and beauty queen, Tara Grinstead, which made national headlines.\n\nAfter four years in Macon, Chelsea moved to Nashville, Tennessee and reported for the ABC affiliate, WKRN-TV.\n\nOne of the most notable stories Chelsea covered while in Music City was the 2020 Nashville Christmas Day bombing. She won an Emmy in the category of ‘best evening newscast’ for her contributions to the 12-hour live coverage and 10pm newscast of the deadly event. \n\nChelsea has covered three Presidential visits to both Georgia and Tennessee and was selected to be a member of the White House Press Pool in 2019. She followed President Donald Trump during his visit to Macon, as he met with farmers affected by Hurricane Michael. She also covered Dr. Jill Biden's visit to Nashville where the First Lady hosted a COVID-19 vaccination clinic and President Joe Biden’s visit to west Kentucky following catastrophic flooding.\n\nChelsea made her TV debut at the age of two on KAKE-TV in Wichita, Kansas, where her father was the evening sports anchor.\n\nWhen she’s not reporting, Chelsea enjoys spending time with friends and family and cheering on the Georgia Bulldogs!

Originally from Nashville, Patrick is excited to return to the southeast after a five-year stint reporting in Seattle. Patrick also reported for TV stations in North Carolina and Wyoming. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland with a degree in journalism.\n\nWhile in Seattle, Patrick covered the nation's first COVID-19 outbreak at a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington. He provided in-depth coverage of the George Floyd protests and the occupied protest zone in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. He also covered major natural disasters, the 2017 Amtrak train derailment in DuPont, Washington and Seattle's (successful) push for a professional hockey team.\n\nA huge sports nut, Patrick grew up an avid Braves and Georgia Bulldogs fan so don't be surprised if you see him in The Battery or between the hedges. When not reporting, Patrick loves traveling, hiking, and exploring the southeast with his golden retriever, JB.\n\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-04-18T15:24:27.998Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wgcl","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/PatrickQuinnTV/","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"25","role":"Reporter"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:56:14.337Z","description":{"basic":"Sawing
