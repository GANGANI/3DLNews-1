She has reported on events ranging from Native American injustices on the reservations of Montana, to the trade of Aaron Rodgers from the Packers to the Jets.  \nFrom a young age, Lindsey knew she was meant for a career that involved talking to people, considering all her report card critiques said, “talks too much”. Once she found a passion for visual storytelling it was a match made in reporter heaven. \nLindsey is thankful to now live where she used to vacation and loves telling the stories of those in her community.

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

Upon moving from Iowa to Texas in 1997, Andrew experienced his first tornado in person and was hooked on weather. The meteorologist on the radio led Andrew’s family to safety, instantly sparking a lifelong passion in Andrew to understand the weather so that he could help other people know what to do in severe weather situations.\nAt the age of 16, Andrew became certified by NOAA and the National Weather Service to storm chase and earned a certification in Advanced Radar Interpretation from the National Weather Service. Andrew continued to pursue his passion for weather at Rowlett High School (Dallas, Texas) where he broadcasted live weathercasts to 3,000 students and staff each week.\nAndrew graduated from the University of Oklahoma where he studied Meteorology and Broadcast Journalism. At OU, Andrew was an on-air meteorologist and reporter for OU Nightly, OU Daily and Purcell Register. Living in Oklahoma allowed Andrew to utilize his storm spotter certification, chasing multiple tornadoes to keep the community ahead of impending bad weather.\nAndrew joined WTOC in early-2018 after spending over two years as a meteorologist at WALB in Albany, Georgia.\nIn 2018, Andrew won First Place in the Associated Press' Best General Reporting after flying with the NOAA Hurricane Hunters. Andrew was also awarded Connect Savannah's 2021 \"Best Local TV Meteorologist\"!\nContinuing his education, Andrew achieved his Broadcast Meteorology Certification from Mississippi State University in 2019.\nWhen not in the studio, Andrew is often talking with local farmers and working to raise awareness for local veteran non-profits.\nYou can watch Andrew on The News at Daybreak every Monday
