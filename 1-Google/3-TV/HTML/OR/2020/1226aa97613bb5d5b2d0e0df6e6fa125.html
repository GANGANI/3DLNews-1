In his free time he hiked the coast, along a pristine spit of land that protects Tillamook Bay from the Pacific Ocean. There was nothing for miles except for dunes, scotch broom and fresh air.

And into this booming atmosphere walked 19-year-old Thomas Irving Potter, the son of a wealthy real-estate developer.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Potter was vacationing at Tillamook Bay.

Being escorted around Tillamook Bay in a boat, by some unnamed pioneer," explained Sutherland.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">"When the goose dropped into the highest dune of the spit, he hiked up to retrieve it and fell in love with the place.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The spit was long and narrow. At some points there was perhaps only a football field of width between the Pacific Ocean and Tillamook Bay. At other spots it was 150 feet high.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">"From the high ridge line that ran down the southern portion of the spit, you could see both the bay on one side and the ocean on the other,” Sutherland said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Potter immediately understood the appeal of a city with views of the roaring Pacific to the west and a pristine bay to the east. It may have reminded him of a miniature San Francisco.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Potter’s family had already developed subdivisions in California, Kansas City and Portland. The family business bought the legal rights to the original homesteads on the spit and formed a real estate company.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Potters named their development "Bayocean Park" and starting drawing up big plans. There was to be a grand hotel, a swimming pool and a boardwalk.

East coast towns like Atlantic City had been built on sand, and it was only seven feet above sea level.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Also, it probably wouldn’t have occurred to the Potters to ask the local tribes about the history of the land.

They also built employee housing , an administration building, an amusement arcade, a store and a bowling alley.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">There was even a natatorium.

Father would work in Portland during the week while mother and the children summered in the family’s very own Bayocean vacation home.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Potters advertised in large cities across the West and sprinkled the society pages with accounts of wealthy couples vacationing in Bayocean.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Enough of the resort had been built by 1911 that there was a buzz and buyers started building summer cottages.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But there was a problem.

As opposed to a two-day trip on a sternwheeler, it was capable of transporting vacationers in style from Portland along the Columbia River and down the coast to Tillamook Bay in just 12 hours.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black float_right"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LNSLGHTA35CINH5PXJWRKNM6U4.jpg?auth=a768396c904114391caa117429a29d4bcdfcfbf4ca8a29d1d174e7db0c42bbd1&amp;width=150" alt="This photo of the Bayocean motor yacht was taken sometime between May 27, 1911, when the yacht was launched in Portland, Oregon, and May 21, 1913, when this image was published in the San Francisco Call.

Navigating the bars where the mighty Pacific met the turbulent waters of both the Columbia River and Tillamook Bay could delay the excursion for days.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Finely dressed vacationers could find themselves clinging to the rails, drenched in salty spray, fighting back nausea.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">So the Potter family came up with another fix — and this is where many think the fate of Bayocean was sealed.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Potters joined the push to get a jetty built to help calm the waters at the bay's entrance. Lumbermen from Portland wanted to build mills in the Tillamook area that could ship their cargo on bigger vessels. A more stable channel also meant safer crossings for fishermen.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The promise of greater economic activity helped spur the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers into action. Surveys were conducted and experts consulted. The Corps recommended a dual-jetty system to make the crossing safe and to protect against shifting sand. But the $2 million price tag was a lot of money in turn-of-the-century Tillamook. When it came time to vote on the idea, there was only enough political will to build one jetty.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“The Corps was reluctant since they'd never done that before,” Sutherland said. “They couldn’t come up with any evidence showing that there would be a negative result if they only built one.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">So despite the Corps’ misgivings, it went with the plan to build only a north jetty.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FU7S4237NBD4RPNORZSGFHA5RE.jpg?auth=f6f2b9639ef892ba85c5883959137d364dc29d3fa7b8d413b5985182b4976966&amp;width=150" alt="The North Jetty under construction in 1915 as seen from Barview." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:3234 / 2086;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>The North Jetty under construction in 1915 as seen from Barview.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Courtesy Garibaldi Maritime Museum.</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The jetty was finished in 1917. It calmed the waters and enhanced Bayocean’s reputation as a desirable summer holiday destination.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">These were the golden years for Bayocean. More and more families started vacationing there. By 1914, some 1,600 sites had been sold and homes were going up.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Small problems at first</h3><div class="article-body--padding article-body-ad"><div class="ad-container f_primary border articleBody

The ocean had eaten away part of the dune they were built on. History writer Jerry Sutherland said the community wrote it off as the natural result of a strong winter storm.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In August 1928, a road finally linked Bayocean to the outside world.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">"There was a grand celebration. The local newspaper reported 1,000 cars and 3,000 to 5,000 people came to celebrate. That would have been the largest gathering of people on Bayocean in all time," said Sutherland.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">That milestone was the result of quiet but mighty forces in the background. Bayocean's seaward currents were being altered by the new jetty. Day after day, month after month, sand was being washed away from the shoreline. Though nobody knew it on that sunny August weekend, Bayocean was destined to shrink — not grow.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Donny Meyers was a young boy when he moved to Bayocean in the 1940s.

He remembers playing with the Coast Guard’s patrol dogs and walking the beaches, finding empty life rafts and boxes of powdered milk.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">One day, he said his friend Jessie Mason figured out the dunes were still high enough to stand on top and contact the blimp pilots overhead.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“And they’d fly over low enough that they could hear him yelling at him through this megaphone. And they’d throw us down Hershey bars and candy bars and stuff,” said Meyers.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But after the war, Bayocean's reprieve was lifted. In 1948, a big storm worsened existing gaps in the spit, making the road at times impassable. Locals tried to fix it with driftwood pilings and hand shovels. But for many, the handwriting was on the wall: one trickster covered a couple of letters in F.D. Mitchell's promotional sign so it read "Watch Bayocean G O."</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Marooned on an island</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In November 1952 a powerful storm tore through the south end of the spit, opening up a half-mile wide gap. The ocean rushed in. Bayocean was no longer at the end of a peninsula. It was marooned on an island.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But instead of building a south jetty, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a structure known as a breakwater, essentially a raised levee meant to stop the sea from flowing into Tillamook Bay.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“The breakwater was constructed in 1956. It was considered a priority above the south jetty because when that breach happened, the areas interior to Tillamook Bay were being affected,” explained coastal engineer Heidi Moritz of the Army Corps.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Once the 1952 storm broke through the narrow isthmus, tons of sand began washing into the bay through the gap, smothering the treasured local oyster beds, breaching lowland levees and sending brackish water into Tillamook's dairyland.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The construction of the breakwater stabilized the situation for Tillamook's industries; however, it took four years to build it. During that time, Bayocean was wiped out for good. Most of what remained was burned, bulldozed and buried under 10 feet of sand.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">A garage was the last Bayocean building to fall into the ocean. It gave way slowly, but was mostly gone by 1971. That was just two years after the U.S. Army Corps started work on a second jetty, which would be completed in 1979. Since then, the shoreline of Bayocean has returned. The island is now a spit again.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">What the native people knew</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">It’s poignant perhaps that nothing about Bayocean would have surprised the few tribal members still living around Tillamook at that time.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Their oral traditions tell of a god-like character, South Wind, whose phallus is the sand spit. He does noble things, like distributing berries across the land for people.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But Portland State University anthropology professor Doug Deur, said South Wind also does some negative things that result in his phallus being severed from time to time.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“It describes him chasing after, attempting to fornicate with a woman who is too young for him. And being punished essentially and so he gets stuck as the tide is rising and has to have it severed,” Deur explained.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/3TMKHQZULJACLJY3NDBGOKAOEE.jpg?auth=73f90e3b8e98a8e6c6122fc705af65752825f3c4a23ced6b29ca9c2d3d6c2fe8&amp;width=150" alt="Oregon State University anthropologist David Lewis thinks tribal members probably advised Bayocean developers about the instability of the spit.

He thinks some of the Native Tillamooks may have warned Bayocean families about erosion issues.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“I mean it was a very racial time period, where native people were not really listened to very much," Lewis said. "Even if they had said something, they probably wouldn’t have been listened to."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">And he thinks maybe that’s what we can learn from the story of Bayocean — to read the environment when making future plans.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">For example, Lewis said tribes tended to build their villages close to resources, like a forest. But they didn’t build in the middle of the forest, because of wildfire. Lewis said there are many examples.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“I think when they saw the community of Champoeg set up on the Willamette River, they were kind of laughing because their houses were above the river maybe on a rise. They knew that at some point, there’d be a massive flood in the valley that would wipe out Champoeg, which actually did happen in 1861," Lewis said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">With tragedies like Champoeg and Bayocean in its history, Oregon has plenty of lessons to learn about working with nature. The next few years should show whether we’ve learned those lessons as we deal with climate change while making development decisions on everything from wind farms to urban expansion. And whatever we do, we’ll be providing lessons — positive or negative — for future generations.</p><div class="article-body--padding article-body-ad"><div class="ad-container f_primary border articleBodyBottom
