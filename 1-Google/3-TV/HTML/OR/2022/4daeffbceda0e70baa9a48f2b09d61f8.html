Once hatched, they would fatten and mature in rectangular concrete tanks sunk into the ground, safe from the perils of the wild, until it was time to make their journey to the ocean.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Carson National Fish Hatchery was among the first hatcheries funded by Congress over 80 years ago to be part of the salvation of salmon, facilities created specifically to replace the vast numbers of wild salmon killed by the building of dozens of hydroelectric dams along the Northwest’s mightiest river, the Columbia. Tucked beside a river in the woods about 60 miles northeast of Portland, Carson has 50 tanks and ponds surrounded by chain-link fencing. They sit among wood-frame fish nursery buildings and a half-dozen cottages built for hatchery workers in the 1930s.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Today, there are hundreds of hatcheries in the Northwest run by federal, state and tribal governments, employing thousands and welcoming the community with visitor centers and gift shops. The fish they send to the Pacific Ocean have allowed restaurants and grocery seafood counters to offer “wild-caught” Chinook salmon even as the fish became endangered.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The hatcheries were supposed to stop the decline of salmon. They haven’t. The numbers of each of the six salmon species native to the Columbia basin have dropped to a fraction of what they once were, and 13 distinct populations are now considered threatened or endangered. Nearly 250 million young salmon, most of them from hatcheries, head to the ocean each year — roughly three times as many as before any dams were built. But the return rate today is less than one-fifth of what it was decades ago. Out of the million salmon eggs fertilized at Carson, only a few thousand will survive their journey to the ocean and return upriver as adults, where they can provide food and income for fishermen or give birth to a new generation.</p><div class="audio-container article-body--padding article-body__media m_top-xs m_bottom-xs"><audio controls="" controlsList="nodownload" preload="metadata"><source src="https://api.spreaker.com/v2/episodes/49941093/play.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Federal officials have propped up aging hatcheries despite their known failures, pouring more than $2.2 billion over the past 20 years into keeping them going instead of investing in new hatcheries and habitat restorations that could sustain salmon for the long term. At the largest cluster of federally subsidized hatcheries on the Columbia, the government spends between $250 and $650 for every salmon that returns to the river. So few fish survive that the network of hatcheries responsible for 80% of all the salmon in the Columbia River is at risk of collapse, unable to keep producing fish at meaningful levels, an investigation by Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica has found.</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/24/how-opb-propublica-analyzed-salmon-steelhead-survival-data/">About the data: How we analyzed salmon and steelhead survival</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">These failures are all the more important because hatcheries represent the U.S. government’s best effort to fulfill a promise to the Northwest’s Indigenous people. The government and tribes signed treaties in the 1850s promising that the tribes’ access to salmon, and their way of life, would be preserved. Those treaties enshrined their right to fish in their “usual and accustomed places.” The pacts between sovereign nations did not stop the U.S. from moving forward with a massive decades-long construction project in the middle of the 20th century: the building of 18 dams that transformed a free-flowing river into a machine of irrigation, shipping and hydroelectric power.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The dams meet nearly 40% of today’s regional electricity needs.

Native fishermen say their way of life has been stolen from them and from future generations. But the government didn’t invest in making hatcheries better equipped to grow more resilient and abundant stocks. Instead, officials ushered in endangered species restrictions. They knew that hatchery fish were genetically weaker than wild salmon, so they put limits on the number of hatchery fish that could be released into rivers, where they might spawn with wild fish and weaken the gene pool. These restrictions hampered the productivity of the hatcheries, squeezing tribal fishing even more.</p><div class="audio-container article-body--padding article-body__media m_top-xs m_bottom-xs"><audio controls="" controlsList="nodownload" preload="metadata"><source src="https://api.spreaker.com/v2/episodes/49955603/play.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In recent years, salmon survival has dropped to some of the worst rates on record.

She also acknowledged that hatcheries will need to change to sustain fish populations as the climate continues to change.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“We want to stay nimble,” she said. “In some cases you may want to change the goal of the hatchery.

Millions don’t survive their trip down the river, which has become a gantlet of dams and slackwater reservoirs, hot and polluted waters, and invasive predators. Millions more die in the ocean or get snared by commercial fishing ships, ending up as grocery fillets or pet food before they can return upriver toward their spawning grounds.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Some die-off is natural. But the dismal survival rates of salmon bred on the Columbia today are neither natural nor sustainable.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica examined the yearly survival of eight Columbia River Basin hatchery populations of vulnerable salmon and steelhead trout, detected at a federal dam on their way out to sea as juveniles and on their way back upriver as adults. This dam-to-dam measure provides one of the only consistent indexes of how well salmon are surviving. But it’s a high-end estimate, because it only measures how well they’re surviving in the ocean. These numbers don’t account for the millions of juvenile fish that die migrating downriver before they’re counted at the dam or the many adults who pass the dam but die before reaching their destination upriver. Our analysis of the publicly available data provides a high-level and easily understandable snapshot of hatchery performance; previously, assessing the health of the hatchery system would have required combing through thousands of pages of government reports and academic research.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Even with this generous estimate, however, the survival rates of these hatchery fish have been well short of the established goals for rebuilding salmon populations, according to the Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica analysis.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"><i>Story continues below graphics.</i></p><hr/><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Graphics: Hatcheries aren’t rebuilding salmon populations in the Columbia basin</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"><i>To rebuild the salmon populations, 4% of juveniles would have to return as adults:</i></p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/BD2UAAIB7RES5CG3ASYN4HRXOI.jpg?auth=0384575cc2686e3f5afb04c20d16cb9a5668cfbbb4fd8096a8ba7354129d9bbc&amp;width=150" alt="Note: Survival rates are for four vulnerable populations of Chinook salmon that were released from hatcheries between 2014 and 2018, the most recent years for which complete data is available.

Penney, now a biologist for the Coeur d’Alene Tribe in northern Idaho, says raising hatchery fish in worsening river and ocean habitat is like “putting a finger in a dike to stop a leak.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Records obtained from NOAA show that over the past five years, dozens of hatchery programs have fallen short of their typical production levels, some by more than half. Some have tried to address that shortfall by capturing more wild fish to breed. Others used eggs that were shared by nearby hatcheries.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But major shortages across the Columbia basin in 2018 and 2019 left hatcheries scrambling to find enough egg-bearing female fish.

By the 1920s, the first analysis of hatcheries at the time found “no evidence” to suggest hatcheries had effectively conserved salmon. Similar research reached the federal Department of Fisheries, a precursor to what is now NOAA Fisheries, in 1929. Amid the poor results and the Great Depression, state and federal fisheries agencies largely abandoned costly large-scale efforts to breed salmon.</p><div class="article-body--padding article-body-ad"><div class="ad-container f_primary border articleBody

Dams were the biggest. Between 1933 and 1975, 18 dams were built on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Nearly half of all salmon habitat in the Columbia basin was completely blocked; the rest was drastically altered as humans turned a free-flowing river system into a series of reservoirs and built farms and communities.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The dams destroyed the river’s most important tribal fishing sites and pushed many populations of wild salmon nearly to the point of extinction or wiped them out entirely. But despite the hatcheries’ failures in the early days, the federal government turned to them after damming up the Columbia and the Snake. It was the best offer officials made to the tribes that depended on salmon.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/CHQVLBCASNGWHK2XQLXEPVSEBA.jpg?auth=971aad7f88b5250f3bbfbf545184a4fe30a7166e6d999da01d019d99c20b6031&amp;width=150" alt="(Left) Native Americans fish for salmon from traditional platforms at Celilo Falls, Oregon, in 1941.

Efforts should be directed toward ameliorating the impact of this development upon the injured interests and not toward a vain attempt to hold still the hands of the clock.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Biologists for the Fish and Wildlife Service knew at the time there was no evidence to suggest hatcheries could make up for the impact. But four of those scientists, including the author of the 1920s research casting doubt on hatcheries, suggested hatcheries anyway; after seeing the government’s plans for dam construction, biologists knew that preserving existing salmon runs would be essentially impossible.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Hatcheries again failed to offset the damage. By the late 1970s, hatcheries were releasing three times more juvenile salmon than scientists estimate the wild fish ever produced themselves. But fish counts at federal dams showed that while tens of millions more juvenile salmon were heading downriver each year, the number of returning adult salmon kept dropping.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Part of the problem was how the fish were bred. Salmon have lasted millions of years, across multiple ice ages, because of the diversity in their populations. But in the hatcheries, that diversity started to disappear and fish developed traits that make it harder for them to survive in the wild.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Rob Jones, the former head of NOAA’s hatchery division, said the agencies running hatcheries have known this for as long as he can remember, which is why they have always depended on wild populations to bolster their stocks.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Without infusing hatcheries, from time to time, with better-fit fish,” Jones said, “hatchery fish might taper off and not return anymore. Because their fitness is just so poor.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the early 1990s, several salmon populations landed on the endangered species list. Scientists and environmental advocates began to argue that hatchery fish posed a threat to wild salmon recovery.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Fisheries scientists, by promoting hatchery technology and giving hatchery tours, have misled the public into thinking that hatcheries are necessary and can truly compensate for habitat loss,” Ray Hilborn, a prominent fisheries scientist at the University of Washington, wrote in a 1992 paper. “Hatchery programs that attempt to add additional fish to existing healthy wild stocks are ill advised and highly dangerous.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">By the end of the 1990s, <a href="https://www.nwcouncil.org/media/filer_public/79/ca/79cabc95-73b0-4764-bc1c-636b34f21226/99_4_5.pdf" target="_blank">a panel of scientists for the Northwest Power and Conservation Council concluded that hatcheries had failed in their objective</a> to mitigate habitat damage and were harming wild populations by competing for food and spreading weaker genes. And, they noted, other scientific reviews had reached the same conclusion.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Scientists and fish culturists should be concerned about the findings of three independent scientific panels that concluded hatcheries have generally failed to meet their objectives,” they wrote.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Congress created a<a href="https://www.streamnet.org/home/data-maps/hatchery-reform/about-hsrg/" target="_blank"> task force to reform hatcheries in 2000</a>, aiming to minimize competition between wild and hatchery fish and to keep weaker hatchery-fish genes out of the wild. Soon, hatcheries faced limits on which fish they could breed, how many wild fish they could capture, how many fish they could release, and how many of their fish were allowed to escape to spawn in the wild. Each hatchery program now requires a genetics management plan.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“There was a lot of work on genetics the past couple of decades, and that’s because that’s probably where our biggest concern was,” said Purcell, who succeeded Jones as head of NOAA hatcheries.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But as it focused on wild genetics, NOAA’s reforms largely ignored how hatcheries grow and release their fish. The agency did not require updates to outdated facilities, nor did it order changes to how hatchery fish were penned, fed or released.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Tribes had begun experimenting with new methods of breeding in their own hatcheries. At its hatchery in Cle Elum, Washington, the Yakama Nation painted concrete tanks to match streambeds, tried filling them with woody debris found in streams, and used underwater feeding tubes so fish didn’t get used to being fed at the surface by humans. They bred captured wild fish instead of hatchery stock and used a collection of earthen ponds to acclimate fish to the wild before they’re released. They documented some success at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280500231_A_Synthesis_of_Findings_from_an_Integrated_Hatchery_Program_after_Three_Generations_of_Spawning_in_the_Natural_Environment/link/55c23d8308aea2d9bdbfe45d/download">increasing abundance while minimizing the harm to wild genetics.</a></p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/JUA2SOD7OBAMPEFMDKEHISWHHA.jpg?auth=606320427d55f3bf32efa3f07cc3648abad1846484f2a193893b7f232ad1ae7c&amp;width=150" alt="At the Melvin R.

And in warmer oceans, fish starve without adequate food.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01734-w" target="_blank">A 2021 study led by NOAA ecologist Lisa Crozier</a> found that warming ocean temperatures could cause salmon survival to decline by roughly 90% within the next 40 years.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“We can imagine all kinds of new situations that could occur. Unfortunately, most of them don’t seem to be favorable for salmon,” Crozier said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The obstacles to saving salmon are myriad. Large swaths of the Columbia River Basin remain impaired by the effects of excessive heat and chemical pollution, and biologists say habitat restoration efforts are far behind what is needed to give salmon a real chance of rebounding. Advocates of removing the four dams on the lower Snake River to save salmon <a href="https://www.nwpb.org/2021/10/25/murray-inslee-detail-salmon-recovery-process-that-could-include-snake-river-dam-removal/" target="_blank">have gotten the attention of elected officials</a>, but that would only benefit one subset of the basin’s salmon. It wouldn’t help the Wenatchi on the upper Columbia. And salmon there and elsewhere would still need a major boost in fitness to survive the ocean journey.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But Crozier’s study also recommended “desperately needed” actions to restore freshwater habitat, improve river flows and change hatchery practices to give salmon a better chance in the ocean.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“My biggest concern about publishing that paper was that people would say, ‘Oh, salmon are doomed.

He points to changes in fish tanks, water temperature and feeding schedules that can all increase hatchery fish’s survival odds. Facilities could also adjust how many fish are released and when: Longtime hatchery philosophy has been to flood the river with fish. But scientists have found that<a href="https://www.nwcouncil.org/reports/density-dependence-and-its-implications-for-fish-management-and-restoration-in-the-columbia-river-basin-and-july-2016-addendum/" target="_blank"> overloading the environment with too many fish can slow population growth</a>, and that varying release times gives fish a better chance of survival.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">As climate change damages the habitats of wild salmon, hatchery fish become all the more important.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“As we increasingly rely on them, we need to do them better,” Berejikian said of hatcheries. “Right now, the emphasis is not there.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Officials at federal agencies governing hatcheries said they know salmon survival needs to improve, but demurred when asked about adopting the strategies Berejikian mentioned.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Most production at the 13 hatcheries run by the Fish and Wildlife Service is governed by legal agreements or settlements, giving the agency little flexibility, spokesperson Brent Lawrence said. He touted the agency’s success in keeping fish alive while they’re at the hatchery and said that fish survival in the wild is largely outside the agency’s control.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“We strive to release the healthiest salmon possible from our hatcheries to give the fish the best chance of survival,” Lawrence said.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Guy Norman, chair of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, acknowledged changes are needed at hatcheries to produce stronger fish. But the council’s latest program called for no such changes. Norman said the council would help facilitate research and improvements, but that it has a limited role in prescribing operations at the state and tribal hatcheries in its program. However, the council has ordered changes in the past, such as stipulating that all hatcheries funded through its program needed to follow recommendations for protecting wild salmon.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Purcell, the NOAA hatcheries official, said her agency is limited in what it can require of hatcheries if the changes aren’t directly impacting an endangered population.
