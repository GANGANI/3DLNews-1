There she covered high profile stories such as the deputy involved shooting death of Andrew Brown Jr., marching alongside protesters and CNN crews as they shed light on an ongoing investigation. Sharon has also tracked hurricanes throughout Eastern North Carolina, uncovered mold and poor air quality in schools, covered the 2020 presidential election, and much more.\nBefore moving to New Bern, Sharon spent two months interning as a reporter in West Africa for Joy News in Accra, Ghana. She uncovered poor food quality and shed light on traffic issues that could save lives. Sharon graduated from the University of Miami with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Sports Administration. During her time at Miami, Sharon worked as a sports and news reporter for UMTV's SportsDesk and NewsVision, two shows on the University's student-run television program. She was also a member of the University of Miami's Women's tennis team, playing singles and doubles. While in college, Sharon interned for the University of Miami's Athletic Broadcast Department, shooting game footage for the ACC Network and ESPN.\nSharon loves trying out new restaurants, cooking, playing tennis, working out, and doing ceramics in her free time. \nWhile Sharon grew up in West Chester, Ohio, she now calls Music City her new home, and she's excited to tell stories of people in the mid-state.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:55:25.936Z","twitter":"https://mobile.twitter.com/Sharon_Stories","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/sharondanq","custom_gray_displaypriority":"13"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-31T02:41:31.102Z","description":{"basic":"Friends

James became active in the community through various outreach initiatives, whether it was speaking at local schools or volunteering to clean up the city. \n\n\nPrior to that, James served as a reporter/ fill-in anchor in Southeast Texas. He covered stories ranging from hurricanes, presidential visits to an explosion at a local oil refinery.\n\n\nOne of the stories that stands out most to him was when he was able to document a father’s ‘fight’ to see his terminally ill daughter in the hospital, at the height of the pandemic. Through his reporting, the hospital changed its policy and allowed him to reunite with her before she died. \n\n\nWhile there, he received a local press club award and was also a part of the station’s coverage which won a statewide Emmy.\n\n\nJames, a Dallas native, graduated from the University of North Texas. As you can imagine, he is a huge Dallas sports fan. \n\n\nWhen he’s not cheering for his favorite teams or reporting, he’s typically spending time with family, traveling or attending church. \n\n\nHe is excited to call the Music City home and looks forward to connecting with viewers and seeing all that the city has to offer.

She was on the ground a whole week after 20 people were killed in Waverly’s deadly flash floods. She walked with protesters and the Tennessee Three lawmakers fighting to get their seat back in the State House. She also brought the latest live coverage of The Covenant School shooting that took six innocent lives. \n\nMarissa uncovered new developments when she spoke with a Tennessee State Representative’s secretary who worked for him when he was arrested by FBI agents. He was later charged with wire fraud, bribery, and kickbacks. \n\nBefore WSMV4, she was an MMJ, reporter, and fill-in anchor in the Quad Cities at WQAD in Moline, Illinois. There she covered “The Flood of 2019” and was on the ground after a barrier along the Mississippi River broke in downtown Davenport, Iowa. She talked with business owners and community members who lost everything to the waters.\n\nMarissa graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she received a B.S. in Advertising. She became the football reporter, and interviewed Head Coach Lovie Smith each week. She also helped anchor the University’s new morning show, “Good Morning Illini.”\n\nWhen not working on a story, Marissa is an avid runner and completed her third marathon in 2022. To compensate she also loves to cook, bake, and try Nashville restaurants.\n\nShe’s the biggest fan of country music born and raised in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nIf you have a story idea, send it to

He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.","longBio":"Jeremy Finley is the chief investigative reporter for WSMV4 Investigates. He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.\n\nJeremy’s investigations have resulted in multiple criminal charges and prison sentences, TBI and district attorney investigations, new state laws, the resignation of one of the highest paid elected officials in Nashville, a $1 million payout to the victims of a nationwide company scamming the sick and uninsured, and the discovery of missing girls.\n\nThe Nashville Scene wrote that Jeremy is “no stranger to blockbuster expose’s.” He was the first to expose the “unintended acceleration” in Toyota vehicles, which ultimately led to one of the largest recall of automobiles in the nation’s history and Congressional hearings in which his investigations were included.\n\nIt's his investigations into elected officials which prompted the Nashville Post to call him a watchdog for exposing corrupt politicians. After Jeremy exposed an elected official lounging in his bathrobe while claiming to be a meeting, the Nashville Scene called the story, “a devastatingly effective expose ... a piece that has already become part of Nashville's political folklore.”\n\nJeremy’s undercover work has repeatedly exposed thieves and scam artists in action, resulting in guilty pleas. In one notable case, he and a WSMV4 photojournalist found runaway girls hiding in the home of a man accused of squatting in a foreclosed home. The girls were then located by police and the man pleaded guilty to harboring runaways.\n\nJeremy is a three-time recipient of the IRE award, one of the highest honors in investigative journalism. He received the honors from Investigative Reporters and Editors for his stories exposing mistakes made by government agencies during the historic flood that swamped downtown Nashville, for his contributions to the WSMV4 investigations that exposed the corruption in former Judge Casey Moreland's courts, and for exposing imposter police officers in Middle Tennessee. He’s also been named as a finalist for the IRE award three times, received a national Emmy nomination for investigative reporting, received a national Edward R. Murrow award and a national Headliner award in 2018 for investigative reporting.\n\nHe’s also received twenty-five Emmys, six regional Edward R. Murrow awards, multiple first place honors from the Associated Press and the Best Public Service award from the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. He's been named the journalist of the year by the AP and was named the best large market TV reporter in Tennessee.\n\nJeremy is reminded daily what’s important in life thanks to the women who run his life: his wife Rebecca and their two daughters. He’s a voracious reader, cheers on the St. Louis Cardinals, has an unhealthy obsession with Jeep Wranglers and is a terrible runner who barely survived a few marathons.\n\nWhile he’s most proud of his investigations, he admits his favorite assignment was covering the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, for WSMV4 and the other stations owned by the Meredith Corporation.\n\nJeremy is also an internationally published novelist. His debut novel, \"The Darkest Time of Night,\" was called one of the best books of the summer by People magazine and the New York Post in 2018. His next book, \"The Dark Above,\" received rave reviews from NPR and the Library Journal. He is busy at work on his next novel.\n\nJeremy is a graduate of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (Go Salukis!).

James covered stories that garnered international interest from the death of Tyre Nichols to the abduction of Eliza Fletcher.\n\n\nWhile living in Memphis, James prided himself on being a voice for underprivileged communities and being a person, who residents could turn to in times of crisis or triumph. \n\n\nHe also was a member of the local National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) chapter. James became active in the community through various outreach initiatives, whether it was speaking at local schools or volunteering to clean up the city. \n\n\nPrior to that, James served as a reporter/ fill-in anchor in Southeast Texas. He covered stories ranging from hurricanes, presidential visits to an explosion at a local oil refinery.\n\n\nOne of the stories that stands out most to him was when he was able to document a father’s ‘fight’ to see his terminally ill daughter in the hospital, at the height of the pandemic. Through his reporting, the hospital changed its policy and allowed him to reunite with her before she died. \n\n\nWhile there, he received a local press club award and was also a part of the station’s coverage which won a statewide Emmy.\n\n\nJames, a Dallas native, graduated from the University of North Texas. As you can imagine, he is a huge Dallas sports fan. \n\n\nWhen he’s not cheering for his favorite teams or reporting, he’s typically spending time with family, traveling or attending church. \n\n\nHe is excited to call the Music City home and looks forward to connecting with viewers and seeing all that the city has to offer.
