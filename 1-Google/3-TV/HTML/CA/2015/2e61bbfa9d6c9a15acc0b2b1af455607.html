Kennedy Journalism Award in 2004 and has twice received an Online Journalism Award for commentary from the Online News Association (2002, 2008).  Fiore has received two awards for his work in new media from the National Cartoonists Society (2001, 2002), and in 2006 received The James Madison Freedom of Information Award from The Society of Professional Journalists.","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fc4e2a612b15b67bad0c6f0e1db4ca9b?s=600&d=blank&r=g","twitter":"MarkFiore","facebook":null,"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/markfiore/?hl=en","linkedin":null,"sites":[{"site":"arts","roles":["contributor"]},{"site":"news","roles":["editor"]},{"site":"futureofyou","roles":["editor"]},{"site":"science","roles":["editor"]}],"headData":{"title":"Mark Fiore | KQED","description":"KQED News Cartoonist","ogImgSrc":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fc4e2a612b15b67bad0c6f0e1db4ca9b?s=600&d=blank&r=g","twImgSrc":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fc4e2a612b15b67bad0c6f0e1db4ca9b?s=600&d=blank&r=g"},"isLoading":false,"link":"/author/markfiore"}},"breakingNewsReducer":{},"campaignFinanceReducer":{},"firebase":{"requesting":{},"requested":{},"timestamps":{},"data":{},"ordered":{},"auth":{"isLoaded":false,"isEmpty":true},"authError":null,"profile":{"isLoaded":false,"isEmpty":true},"listeners":{"byId":{},"allIds":[]},"isInitializing":false,"errors":[]},"navBarReducer":{"navBarId":"news","fullView":true,"showPlayer":false},"navMenuReducer":{"menus":[{"key":"menu1","items":[{"name":"News","link":"/","type":"title"},{"name":"Politics","link":"/politics"},{"name":"Science","link":"/science"},{"name":"Education","link":"/educationnews"},{"name":"Housing","link":"/housing"},{"name":"Immigration","link":"/immigration"},{"name":"Criminal Justice","link":"/criminaljustice"},{"name":"Silicon Valley","link":"/siliconvalley"},{"name":"Forum","link":"/forum"},{"name":"The California Report","link":"/californiareport"}]},{"key":"menu2","items":[{"name":"Arts & Culture","link":"/arts","type":"title"},{"name":"Critics’ Picks","link":"/thedolist"},{"name":"Cultural Commentary","link":"/artscommentary"},{"name":"Food & Drink","link":"/food"},{"name":"Bay Area Hip-Hop","link":"/bayareahiphop"},{"name":"Rebel Girls","link":"/rebelgirls"},{"name":"Arts Video","link":"/artsvideos"}]},{"key":"menu3","items":[{"name":"Podcasts","link":"/podcasts","type":"title"},{"name":"Bay Curious","link":"/podcasts/baycurious"},{"name":"Rightnowish","link":"/podcasts/rightnowish"},{"name":"The Bay","link":"/podcasts/thebay"},{"name":"On Our Watch","link":"/podcasts/onourwatch"},{"name":"Mindshift","link":"/podcasts/mindshift"},{"name":"Consider This","link":"/podcasts/considerthis"},{"name":"Political Breakdown","link":"/podcasts/politicalbreakdown"}]},{"key":"menu4","items":[{"name":"Live Radio","link":"/radio","type":"title"},{"name":"TV","link":"/tv","type":"title"},{"name":"Events","link":"/events","type":"title"},{"name":"For Educators","link":"/education","type":"title"},{"name":"Support KQED","link":"/support","type":"title"},{"name":"About","link":"/about","type":"title"},{"name":"Help Center","link":"https://kqed-helpcenter.kqed.org/s","type":"title"}]}]},"pagesReducer":{},"postsReducer":{"stream_live":{"type":"live","id":"stream_live","audioUrl":"https://streams.kqed.org/kqedradio","title":"Live Stream","excerpt":"Live Stream information currently unavailable.","link":"/radio","featImg":"","label":{"name":"KQED Live","link":"/"}},"stream_kqedNewscast":{"type":"posts","id":"stream_kqedNewscast","audioUrl":"https://www.kqed.org/.stream/anon/radio/RDnews/newscast.mp3?_=1","title":"KQED Newscast","featImg":"","label":{"name":"88.5 FM","link":"/"}},"news_11862291":{"type":"posts","id":"news_11862291","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"news","id":"11862291","score":null,"sort":[1614603629000]},"parent":0,"labelTerm":{"site":"news","term":72},"blocks":[],"publishDate":1614603629,"format":"audio","disqusTitle":"Women Janitors Win More Protections From Rape on the Night Shift","title":"Women Janitors Win More Protections From Rape on the Night Shift","headTitle":"The California Report | KQED News","content":"\u003cp>The nation's largest janitorial company,\u003ca href=\"https://www.abm.com/\"> ABM Industries,\u003c/a> has settled a lawsuit with three women janitors from Fresno who claimed the company fostered a sexually hostile work environment, emboldening supervisors to sexually harass and assault employees.

The company declined to be interviewed about the allegations made by the three women because of ongoing legal claims. But in a statement, ABM said it takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously, and responded quickly to the complaints by the Fresno janitors. The accused men no longer work for ABM, the company said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some of the harassment the women report happened while the company was under a court&#8208;ordered agreement with the federal government to improve how it handles sexual harassment. That arrangement came as a result of a lawsuit in the Central Valley of California, which included allegations from Fresno.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;This is a pervasive problem that is so big and has been around for so long, there is really no way to say that the company was not aware of the possibility &ndash; indeed the probability &ndash; that there were women facing this kind of abuse,&rdquo; said Jennifer Reisch, an attorney with Equal Rights Advocates, who is one of the lawyers representing the three women.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The three Fresno janitors complained to the company about the behavior in spring 2017, and ABM placed them on paid leave while it looked into the matter.

While she was on the clock, her direct supervisor regularly watched pornography from his truck, masturbated in front of her while he propositioned her and made obscene comments about her body, according to documents she submitted to the EEOC.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(Mercedes is a pseudonym because Reveal does not use the names of people reporting sexual violence without their permission. The name of the supervisor was blacked out in the documents provided by the women&rsquo;s attorneys.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For years, Mercedes said she felt pressured to stay quiet about the harassment because her boss threatened to fire her or get her deported. She also told the government that she had not reported the harassment to the company sooner because ABM had never clearly explained how she could make a complaint. This echoes what other janitors have said in previous cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mercedes finally went to the police in 2014 after she says her supervisor tried to rape her in his car under the pretense of taking her to a new work site. But even then, she told the police she was too fearful of deportation and losing her job to move forward with the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last spring, Mercedes went back to the police. She says that several months before, the supervisor had cornered her in a cramped supply closet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The suspect then pulled out his penis from his pants and told the victim to give him oral sex,&rdquo; the police report states. &ldquo;The victim stated no and turned away from him. The suspect then grabbed the victim&rsquo;s hand and tried to get her to touch his penis.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mercedes says she was able to push him away, but he continued to harass her. Just days before she filed the report, he &ldquo;thrusted his groin area toward the rear of the victim&rsquo;s buttocks,&rdquo; the report says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The same supervisor was accused of assaulting another female ABM janitor based in Fresno. In a June 2017 police report, she says that when she was cleaning the kitchen of a Citibank branch years before, the supervisor had grabbed her and raped her with his finger by placing &ldquo;a foot between her legs so she couldn&rsquo;t close them and forced his left hand down her pants.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The accusations extended beyond a single supervisor. A third janitor said that another male foreman tried to kiss her and take off her pants.

In the past, he said, the company tended to take the supervisor&rsquo;s side when it received a sexual harassment complaint.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The company also signed a labor contract last spring that added provisions for addressing sexual harassment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;ABM has become better allies in the sense of understanding that they have a role to play in this, that deniability is no longer acceptable,&rdquo; Huerta said. &ldquo;Do I think they&rsquo;re 100 percent cured?

It is among a rare group of American companies that have been sued multiple times by the federal government for sexual harassment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In lawsuits, janitors have complained that the company failed to take their reports of sexual harassment seriously. In the San Francisco case that resulted in the 2015 settlement, a supervisor dissuaded a janitor who said she had been raped by her manager from calling the police. In another case filed by the federal government, the company did not talk to a church volunteer who said he saw a supervisor try to attack a janitor. That supervisor turned out to be a registered sex offender and other janitors say he went on to attack them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The conditions of night&#8208;shift janitorial work foster sexual violence. According to a 2016 report by UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Labor Occupational Health Program, the combination of isolation, vulnerable workers, poorly trained managers and layers of subcontracting contribute to a &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; that allows harassment to flourish.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Reisch said that given these conditions, ABM could be more proactive in trying to protect its workers by doing more targeted and direct outreach about sexual harassment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;A company like ABM, that knows that its workforce is comprised of thousands of women who are working at night, alone, who have vulnerabilities as the result of the conditions in which they work &ndash; they need to take extra steps,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They can't just wait until the next rape happens.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\"Rape on the Night Shift\" is an investigative collaboration between KQED, \u003ca href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FRONTLINE\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://www.univision.com/noticias\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Univision\u003c/a> and the \u003ca href=\"https://investigativereportingprogram.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley\u003c/a>.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos.png\">\u003cimg src=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-800x63.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"63\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11642070\" srcset=\"https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-800x63.png 800w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-160x13.png 160w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-240x19.png 240w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-375x29.png 375w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos-520x41.png 520w, https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/10/2018/01/logos.png 865w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\">\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n","disqusIdentifier":"11642062 https://ww2.kqed.org/news/?p=11642062","disqusUrl":"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2018/01/16/nations-largest-janitorial-company-faces-new-allegations-of-rape/","stats":{"hasVideo":false,"hasChartOrMap":false,"hasAudio":false,"hasPolis":false,"wordCount":2029,"hasGoogleForm":false,"hasGallery":false,"hasHearkenModule":false,"iframeSrcs":[],"paragraphCount":44},"modified":1516127165,"excerpt":"ABM Industries Inc. has a history of being sued for failing to stop sexual abuse on the job.","headData":{"twImgId":"","twTitle":"","ogTitle":"","ogImgId":"","twDescription":"","description":"ABM Industries Inc. has a history of being sued for failing to stop sexual abuse on the job.","title":"Nation’s Largest Janitorial Company Faces New Allegations of Rape | KQED","ogDescription":"","schema":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","headline":"Nation’s Largest Janitorial Company Faces New Allegations of Rape","datePublished":"2018-01-16T02:01:32-08:00","dateModified":"2018-01-16T10:26:05-08:00","image":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KQED-OG-Image@1x.png","isAccessibleForFree":"True","publisher":{"@type":"NewsMediaOrganization","@id":"https://www.kqed.org/#organization","name":"KQED","url":"https://www.kqed.org","logo":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KQED-OG-Image@1x.png"}}},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"nations-largest-janitorial-company-faces-new-allegations-of-rape","status":"publish","sourceUrl":"https://www.revealnews.org/","nprByline":"\u003cstrong>\u003ca href=”https://www.revealnews.org/author/bernice-yeung/”>Bernice Yeung\u003c/a>\u003cbr />\u003ca href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/\">Reveal\u003c/a>\u003c/strong>","source":"Reveal","path":"/news/11642062/nations-largest-janitorial-company-faces-new-allegations-of-rape","audioTrackLength":null,"parsedContent":[{"type":"contentString","content":"\u003cdiv class=\"post-body\">\u003cp>\u003cp>\u003cem>In the #MeToo era, KQED is revisiting its groundbreaking &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"http://ww2.kqed.org/news/tag/night-shift\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rape on the Night Shift\u003c/a>&rdquo; series from 2015.

The company declined to be interviewed about the allegations made by the three women because of ongoing legal claims. But in a statement, ABM said it takes all allegations of sexual harassment seriously, and responded quickly to the complaints by the Fresno janitors. The accused men no longer work for ABM, the company said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some of the harassment the women report happened while the company was under a court&#8208;ordered agreement with the federal government to improve how it handles sexual harassment.

While she was on the clock, her direct supervisor regularly watched pornography from his truck, masturbated in front of her while he propositioned her and made obscene comments about her body, according to documents she submitted to the EEOC.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(Mercedes is a pseudonym because Reveal does not use the names of people reporting sexual violence without their permission. The name of the supervisor was blacked out in the documents provided by the women&rsquo;s attorneys.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For years, Mercedes said she felt pressured to stay quiet about the harassment because her boss threatened to fire her or get her deported. She also told the government that she had not reported the harassment to the company sooner because ABM had never clearly explained how she could make a complaint. This echoes what other janitors have said in previous cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mercedes finally went to the police in 2014 after she says her supervisor tried to rape her in his car under the pretense of taking her to a new work site. But even then, she told the police she was too fearful of deportation and losing her job to move forward with the case.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last spring, Mercedes went back to the police. She says that several months before, the supervisor had cornered her in a cramped supply closet.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The suspect then pulled out his penis from his pants and told the victim to give him oral sex,&rdquo; the police report states. &ldquo;The victim stated no and turned away from him. The suspect then grabbed the victim&rsquo;s hand and tried to get her to touch his penis.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mercedes says she was able to push him away, but he continued to harass her. Just days before she filed the report, he &ldquo;thrusted his groin area toward the rear of the victim&rsquo;s buttocks,&rdquo; the report says.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The same supervisor was accused of assaulting another female ABM janitor based in Fresno. In a June 2017 police report, she says that when she was cleaning the kitchen of a Citibank branch years before, the supervisor had grabbed her and raped her with his finger by placing &ldquo;a foot between her legs so she couldn&rsquo;t close them and forced his left hand down her pants.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The accusations extended beyond a single supervisor. A third janitor said that another male foreman tried to kiss her and take off her pants.

Every week, Pen talks to movers and shakers about how the Bay Area shapes what they create, and how they shape the place we call home.","imageSrc":"https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Rightnowish-Podcast-Tile-500x500-1.jpg","imageAlt":"KQED Rightnowish with Pendarvis Harshaw","officialWebsiteLink":"/podcasts/rightnowish","meta":{"site":"arts","source":"kqed","order":"5"},"link":"/podcasts/rightnowish","subscribe":{"npr":"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/721590300/rightnowish","rss":"https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/programs/rightnowish/feed/podcast","apple":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rightnowish/id1482187648","stitcher":"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/kqed/rightnowish","google":"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vS1FJTkMxMjU5MTY3NDc4","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/show/7kEJuafTzTVan7B78ttz1I"}},"jerrybrown":{"id":"jerrybrown","title":"The Political Mind of Jerry Brown","tagline":"Lessons from a lifetime in politics","info":"The Political Mind of Jerry Brown brings listeners the wisdom of the former Governor, Mayor, and presidential candidate.
