The gap between being inspired and entertained just got smaller. Join <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Kelly Corrigan as she choreographs big-ideas conversations and personal truth-telling with some of the creative thinkers and artists who define our time. Corrigan and her guests dig into such questions as “Is knowing more always better?” and trade stories on topics ranging from what makes creativity possible to how someone might convince her spouse to participate in a sex study. Corrigan’s conversational style, perceptive humor, and connection with the audience bring out the best in her guests, as they meander toward that inevitable moment when you think, “Exactly!”
