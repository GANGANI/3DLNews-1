The name was changed the following year because a nearby section of Berkeley was also called Ocean View. The town became Albany because the first mayor, Frank J. Roberts, was born in Albany, New York.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Alcatraz\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>It is Spanish for \"pelican.\" The name Isla de Los Alcatraces was first given to what is now Yerba Buena Island because there were so many pelicans there. Later the name was transferred to the Alcatraz Island of today.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Angel Island\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Juan Manuel de Ayala named it Isla de los &Aacute;ngeles in 1775.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Antioch\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>In 1849 the place was called Smith's Landing because it had been settled by twin brothers with the surname Smith. One of the brothers was a minister and invited a group of New Englanders to settle on his property. On July 4, 1851, the new citizens had a picnic and decided to rename the land Antioch, after a Biblical city in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Atherton\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The town was named after the businessman Faxon D. Atherton, who first visited California in 1836. Years later he acquired 500 acres where the town now sits.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Benicia\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The land was to be named Francisca, after the wife of Gen. Mariano Vallejo. But when the chief magistrate of Yerba Buena registered the name for the town, he decided to call his growing settlement San Francisco. Francisca became too similar to San Francisco, and thus the name was changed to another one of Se&ntilde;ora Vallejo&rsquo;s names, Benicia.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Berkeley\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>On May 24, 1866, the trustees of the College of California chose the name Berkeley. Frederick Billings proposed the name, inspired by a poem from George Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. Berkeley had written the poem in 1728 while sailing to Rhode Island with the ultimate goal of founding a school in Bermuda: &ldquo;Westward the course of Empire takes its way / The four first acts already past, / A fifth shall close the drama with the day / Time's noblest offspring is the last.&rdquo; Less known is that Berkeley bought slaves to work on his plantation during his stay in Rhode Island.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Bolinas\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>In 1834, Ignacio Martinez mentioned a valley that people call &ldquo;Baulenes.&rdquo; The name probably comes from a Coast Miwok word. The name was misspelled as Ballenas from 1852 to 1910 on Coast Survey charts, an accidental analogy to the Spanish word for whale. Then in 1896, George Davidson falsely assumed the bay had been named for Francisco de Bola&ntilde;os from Sebasti&aacute;n Vizca&iacute;no's expedition. This caused the spelling to change to Bolanos and Boli&ntilde;as. By 1873, the USGS adopted the spelling Bolinas.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Burlingame\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Named in 1868 by William Ralston. He named it after his friend, Anson Burlingame, a lawyer and politician. Notably, Burlingame had been President Abraham Lincoln's U.S. minister to the Qing Empire in China.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Castro Valley\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Named after Guillermo Castro, a rancher.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Concord\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Salvio Pacheco, owner of the Monte del Diablo rancho, selected the site for a town in 1862. He named the settlement Todos Santos, but many of the new residents were from New England with Anglo sensibilities. By 1869, the town was known as Concord, probably referring to the Concord in Massachusetts.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Cupertino\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The town took the name from Cupertino Creek, which had been named for St. Joseph of Cupertino.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Daly City\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>John Daly arrived in California when he was 13 in the 1850s. His mother had died on the Panama Canal crossing. The boy found work on a dairy farm and rose quickly. By 1868 he owned 250 acres. After the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans took refuge on Daly's dairy farm. When the land was incorporated in 1911, the town was named in his honor.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Danville\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>It was named in the 1860s, possibly after Danville, Kentucky.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Dublin\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>James Witt Dougherty bought a large parcel of land in the area. By the 1870s many Irish immigrants had moved nearby. It is rumored that Dougherty said &ldquo;There are so many Irish here, you might as well call it Dublin.&rdquo;\u003cbr>\n[baycuriouspodcastinfo]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>El Cerrito\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>It means \"little hill\" in Spanish. The hill it refers to is actually in Albany and is now called Albany Hill.

The name was changed the following year because a nearby section of Berkeley was also called Ocean View. The town became Albany because the first mayor, Frank J. Roberts, was born in Albany, New York.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Alcatraz\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>It is Spanish for \"pelican.\" The name Isla de Los Alcatraces was first given to what is now Yerba Buena Island because there were so many pelicans there. Later the name was transferred to the Alcatraz Island of today.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Angel Island\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Juan Manuel de Ayala named it Isla de los &Aacute;ngeles in 1775.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Antioch\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>In 1849 the place was called Smith's Landing because it had been settled by twin brothers with the surname Smith. One of the brothers was a minister and invited a group of New Englanders to settle on his property. On July 4, 1851, the new citizens had a picnic and decided to rename the land Antioch, after a Biblical city in Syria.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Atherton\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The town was named after the businessman Faxon D. Atherton, who first visited California in 1836. Years later he acquired 500 acres where the town now sits.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Benicia\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The land was to be named Francisca, after the wife of Gen. Mariano Vallejo. But when the chief magistrate of Yerba Buena registered the name for the town, he decided to call his growing settlement San Francisco. Francisca became too similar to San Francisco, and thus the name was changed to another one of Se&ntilde;ora Vallejo&rsquo;s names, Benicia.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Berkeley\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>On May 24, 1866, the trustees of the College of California chose the name Berkeley. Frederick Billings proposed the name, inspired by a poem from George Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. Berkeley had written the poem in 1728 while sailing to Rhode Island with the ultimate goal of founding a school in Bermuda: &ldquo;Westward the course of Empire takes its way / The four first acts already past, / A fifth shall close the drama with the day / Time's noblest offspring is the last.&rdquo; Less known is that Berkeley bought slaves to work on his plantation during his stay in Rhode Island.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Bolinas\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>In 1834, Ignacio Martinez mentioned a valley that people call &ldquo;Baulenes.&rdquo; The name probably comes from a Coast Miwok word. The name was misspelled as Ballenas from 1852 to 1910 on Coast Survey charts, an accidental analogy to the Spanish word for whale. Then in 1896, George Davidson falsely assumed the bay had been named for Francisco de Bola&ntilde;os from Sebasti&aacute;n Vizca&iacute;no's expedition. This caused the spelling to change to Bolanos and Boli&ntilde;as. By 1873, the USGS adopted the spelling Bolinas.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Burlingame\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Named in 1868 by William Ralston. He named it after his friend, Anson Burlingame, a lawyer and politician. Notably, Burlingame had been President Abraham Lincoln's U.S. minister to the Qing Empire in China.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Castro Valley\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Named after Guillermo Castro, a rancher.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Concord\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Salvio Pacheco, owner of the Monte del Diablo rancho, selected the site for a town in 1862. He named the settlement Todos Santos, but many of the new residents were from New England with Anglo sensibilities. By 1869, the town was known as Concord, probably referring to the Concord in Massachusetts.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Cupertino\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>The town took the name from Cupertino Creek, which had been named for St. Joseph of Cupertino.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Daly City\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>John Daly arrived in California when he was 13 in the 1850s. His mother had died on the Panama Canal crossing. The boy found work on a dairy farm and rose quickly. By 1868 he owned 250 acres. After the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans took refuge on Daly's dairy farm. When the land was incorporated in 1911, the town was named in his honor.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Danville\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>It was named in the 1860s, possibly after Danville, Kentucky.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Dublin\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>James Witt Dougherty bought a large parcel of land in the area. By the 1870s many Irish immigrants had moved nearby.
