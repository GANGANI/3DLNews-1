His job was to look out for negative stories from women he could &ldquo;take off the marketplace,&rdquo; by buying up the rights but never publishing them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The plan, as Pecker outlined it, was for him to suppress these stories, and at the same time publish negative stories about Trump&rsquo;s opponents. Some of these stories, Pecker said, were sent to Trump and Cohen for approval prior to publication.[aside label=\"related coverage\" tag=\"trump\"]Over the next year, Pecker said he carried out this role. His testimony was corroborated by Keith Davidson, an attorney who represented both Daniels and former \u003cem>Playboy \u003c/em>model Karen McDougal. Around June 2016, McDougal considered going public with her story of a yearlong affair with Trump. But Pecker bought the rights to that story, with the expectation that he would be reimbursed by Trump. That never happened.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early October 2016, according to the testimony of former Trump communications aide Hope Hicks, the campaign was rocked by the release of the \u003cem>Access Hollywood \u003c/em>tape, where Trump could be heard boasting &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab &rsquo;em by the p****.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The next day, Daniels threatened to go public with accusations she&rsquo;d had a sexual encounter with \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/07/1249318101/stormy-daniels-trump-trial-new-york\">Trump in 2006\u003c/a> in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite during a celebrity golf tournament, according to Pecker, Cohen and Davidson.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In her testimony, Daniels said there was a &ldquo;power imbalance&rdquo; when, after leaving the suite&rsquo;s restroom, she found Trump on the hotel bed in his underwear. That&rsquo;s when, Daniels said, they had sex.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>She testified that Trump had dangled a possible role on his TV show \u003cem>Celebrity Apprentice\u003c/em>. This detail &mdash; that the sex wasn&rsquo;t entirely wanted &mdash; caused the defense to request a mistrial, which was denied. It also provided a motive for Trump to suppress the story. Prosecutors said, &ldquo;Trump knew what happened in that hotel room&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t want it to come out. The adult film actor&rsquo;s testimony also included intimate details of her alleged sexual encounter, some of which Judge Juan M. Merchan agreed with the defense were not necessary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As October drew to a close, Cohen testified, he frantically opened bank accounts and tried to come up with a way to pay the $130,000 to keep Daniels quiet. But Trump, Cohen said, wanted to delay the payment until after the election, with the idea that after that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if Daniels was paid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This point, that Trump was making the payment to influence the election by keeping women voters on board, was corroborated by a number of other witnesses. Hicks testified Trump, by then in the White House, told her that it was better the story came out in 2018, rather than 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen ultimately wired the money himself to Daniels, with the understanding, he said, that he would be repaid by Trump. Cohen testified to a number of conversations with Trump, backed up by phone records, including on the day he wired the payments. But the defense rattled Cohen on cross-examination when it presented evidence that one of the calls which Cohen had said was made through Trump&rsquo;s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, was instead with Schiller about threats from a 14-year-old prankster.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, the heart of the case rested on the testimony of what happened after the election, when the records were falsified, in particular the handwritten notes and documents from the Trump Organization&rsquo;s former comptroller, Jeff McConney.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>McConney authenticated a key record: the bank statement showing Cohen&rsquo;s wire transfer. That record included handwritten notes from Cohen and Trump&rsquo;s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, describing the $130,000 payment that would be &ldquo;grossed up&rdquo; to cover Cohen&rsquo;s taxes. That sum, combined with another reimbursement and a bonus, for a total of $420,000, was paid out over 12 months at a rate of $35,000 per month.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The payments would be described as pursuant to a &ldquo;legal retainer.&rdquo; (Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury in Trump&rsquo;s civil fraud trial, did not testify.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the stand, Cohen described a repayment scheme that formed the basis of the 34 counts of falsified business records: 11 falsified invoices, 12 falsified ledger entries and 11 checks falsely recording the repayment as legal &ldquo;retainers.&rdquo; Nine of the checks were signed by Trump, himself.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohen said he and Weisselberg met and discussed the agreement with Trump shortly before he left for Washington, on or about Jan. 17, 2020. Cohen said Trump approved the deal, saying at the end of the meeting that &ldquo;it was going to be one heck of a ride&rdquo; in Washington. Cohen said he and Trump discussed the arrangement again, in early February, in the Oval Office. Photos and White House records corroborated that the two met in the Oval Office at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The defense presented just two witnesses, including Robert Costello, an attorney who wanted to represent Cohen after Cohen&rsquo;s home and office were searched by the FBI in 2018. Costello had been put on the stand to refute Cohen&rsquo;s claim that Costello was pressuring Cohen to stay on Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; But Costello&rsquo;s emails showed that Trump was deciding which of Cohen&rsquo;s lawyers he wanted to pay, and that Costello was concerned about not giving &ldquo;the appearance that we are following instructions from [Rudy] Giuliani or the president,&rdquo; referring to the former New York City mayor who was Trump&rsquo;s lawyer at the time.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003cstrong>How this conviction could affect the 2024 election\u003c/strong>\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>This likely is the only one of Trump&rsquo;s four ongoing criminal cases that will be heard ahead of the 2024 election in November, since federal trials in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and a state case in Georgia are in various stages of delays.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This decision in New York is likely to have rippling effects as Trump campaigns as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

Spamouflage operates across a wide range of social media platforms and internet forums, pushing pro-China messages and attacking critics of Beijing. Last year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it&rsquo;s ever disrupted and linked it to Chinese law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Both Doppelganger and Spamouflage used OpenAI tools to generate comments in multiple languages that were posted across social media sites. The Russian network also used AI to translate articles from Russian into English and French and to turn website articles into Facebook posts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Spamouflage accounts used AI to debug code for a website targeting Chinese dissidents, to analyze social media posts, and to research news and current events. Some posts from fake Spamouflage accounts only received replies from other fake accounts in the same network.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another previously unreported Russian network banned by OpenAI focused its efforts on spamming \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086483703/telegram-ukraine-war-russia\">the messaging app Telegram\u003c/a>. It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta. The posts were aimed at audiences in the U.S., Canada and Israel.

Spamouflage operates across a wide range of social media platforms and internet forums, pushing pro-China messages and attacking critics of Beijing. Last year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it&rsquo;s ever disrupted and linked it to Chinese law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Both Doppelganger and Spamouflage used OpenAI tools to generate comments in multiple languages that were posted across social media sites.

It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta.
