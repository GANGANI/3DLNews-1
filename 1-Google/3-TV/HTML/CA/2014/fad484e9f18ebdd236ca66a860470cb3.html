Spamouflage operates across a wide range of social media platforms and internet forums, pushing pro-China messages and attacking critics of Beijing. Last year, Facebook owner Meta said Spamouflage is the largest covert influence operation it&rsquo;s ever disrupted and linked it to Chinese law enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Both Doppelganger and Spamouflage used OpenAI tools to generate comments in multiple languages that were posted across social media sites. The Russian network also used AI to translate articles from Russian into English and French and to turn website articles into Facebook posts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Spamouflage accounts used AI to debug code for a website targeting Chinese dissidents, to analyze social media posts, and to research news and current events. Some posts from fake Spamouflage accounts only received replies from other fake accounts in the same network.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another previously unreported Russian network banned by OpenAI focused its efforts on spamming \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086483703/telegram-ukraine-war-russia\">the messaging app Telegram\u003c/a>. It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta. The posts were aimed at audiences in the U.S., Canada and Israel. Meta banned Stoic from its platforms and sent the company a cease and desist letter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>OpenAI said the Israeli operation used AI to generate and edit articles and comments posted across Instagram, Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, as well as to create fictitious personas and bios for fake accounts. It also found some activity from the network targeting elections in India.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>None of the operations OpenAI disrupted only used AI-generated content. &ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t a case of giving up on human generation and shifting to AI but of mixing the two,&rdquo; Nimmo said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He said that while AI does offer threat actors some benefits, including boosting the volume of what they can produce and improving translations across languages, it doesn&rsquo;t help them overcome the main challenge of distribution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;You can generate the content, but if you don&rsquo;t have the distribution systems to land it in front of people in a way that seems credible, then you&rsquo;re going to struggle getting it across,&rdquo; Nimmo said. &ldquo;And really, what we&rsquo;re seeing here is that dynamic playing out.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But companies like OpenAI must stay vigilant, he added. &ldquo;This is not the time for complacency.

It used OpenAI tools to debug code for a program that automatically posted on Telegram and used AI to generate the comments its accounts posted on the app. Like Doppelganger, the operation&rsquo;s efforts were broadly aimed at undermining support for Ukraine via posts that weighed in on politics in the U.S. and Moldova.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another campaign that both OpenAI and Meta said they disrupted in recent months traced back to a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv called Stoic. Fake accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and concerned citizens. They posted about the war in Gaza, praised Israel&rsquo;s military and criticized college antisemitism and the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip, according to Meta. The posts were aimed at audiences in the U.S., Canada and Israel. Meta banned Stoic from its platforms and sent the company a cease and desist letter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>OpenAI said the Israeli operation used AI to generate and edit articles and comments posted across Instagram, Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, as well as to create fictitious personas and bios for fake accounts. It also found some activity from the network targeting elections in India.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>None of the operations OpenAI disrupted only used AI-generated content. &ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t a case of giving up on human generation and shifting to AI but of mixing the two,&rdquo; Nimmo said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He said that while AI does offer threat actors some benefits, including boosting the volume of what they can produce and improving translations across languages, it doesn&rsquo;t help them overcome the main challenge of distribution.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;You can generate the content, but if you don&rsquo;t have the distribution systems to land it in front of people in a way that seems credible, then you&rsquo;re going to struggle getting it across,&rdquo; Nimmo said. &ldquo;And really, what we&rsquo;re seeing here is that dynamic playing out.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But companies like OpenAI must stay vigilant, he added. &ldquo;This is not the time for complacency. History shows that influence operations which spent years failing to get anywhere can suddenly break out if nobody&rsquo;s looking for them.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003c/div>\u003c/p>","attributes":{"named":{},"numeric":[]}}],"link":"/news/11988245/openai-thwarts-influence-operations-by-russia-china-and-israel","authors":["byline_news_11988245"],"categories":["news_8","news_248"],"tags":["news_2114","news_18378","news_33542","news_20279"],"affiliates":["news_253"],"featImg":"news_11988247","label":"news_253"},"news_11988031":{"type":"posts","id":"news_11988031","meta":{"index":"posts_1716263798","site":"news","id":"11988031","score":null,"sort":[1717005838000]},"guestAuthors":[],"slug":"california-lawmakers-introduce-measures-to-fight-ai-discrimination-deepfakes","title":"California Lawmakers Introduce Measures to Fight AI Discrimination, Deepfakes","publishDate":1717005838,"format":"standard","headTitle":"California Lawmakers Introduce Measures to Fight AI Discrimination, Deepfakes | KQED","labelTerm":{"site":"news"},"content":"\u003cp>As corporations increasingly weave artificial intelligence technologies into the daily lives of Americans, California lawmakers want to build public trust, fight algorithmic discrimination and outlaw deepfakes that involve elections or pornography.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The efforts in California &mdash; home to many of the world&rsquo;s biggest AI companies &mdash; could pave the way for AI regulations across the country.

The AI Act addresses how law enforcement agencies can use AI, while Bauer-Kahan&rsquo;s bill does not, and Wicks&rsquo; watermarking bill could end up stronger than AI Act requirements. But the California bills and the AI Act both take a risk-based approach to regulation, both advise continued testing and assessment of forms of AI deemed high risk, and both call for watermarking generative AI outputs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;If you take these three bills together, you&rsquo;re probably at 70%&ndash;80% of what we cover in the AI Act,&rdquo; de Graaf said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very solid relationship that we both benefit from.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the meeting, de Graaf said they discussed draft AI bills, AI bias and risk assessments, advanced AI models, the state of watermarking images and videos made by AI, and which issues to prioritize.
