Proposition 22 was the industry&rsquo;s response to \u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5\">Assembly Bill 5\u003c/a>, a state law that codified a state Supreme Court decision that would have required the companies \u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/economy/2019/09/whos-in-whos-out-of-ab-5/\">to classify those workers as employees\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Treating gig workers as independent contractors is central to the business model of the California-based companies, the middlemen who gave rise to the on-demand, app-based gig economy that has permeated our culture. The companies are fighting to hang on to that model, saying it helps them provide gig workers with flexible schedules. Critics say it lets the companies avoid paying employment taxes and shift financial responsibility to their workers and customers, plus governments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2021, a Superior Court judge \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-20/prop-22-unconstitutional\">invalidated Proposition 22\u003c/a>, saying it limits the Legislature&rsquo;s constitutional power to create and enforce a complete workers&rsquo; compensation system because it declares gig workers independent contractors ineligible for the benefit. While the state Supreme Court will be considering this narrow issue, because of a clause in the initiative, it&rsquo;s possible the whole law will be thrown out because of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gig companies appealed the judge&rsquo;s decision, and a state appeals court ruled 2 to 1 \u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/economy/2023/03/prop-22-appeal/\">in their favor\u003c/a> last year.

After it became law, app-based platform workers became eligible for some benefits, such as guaranteed weekly earnings of 120% of minimum wage, health care stipends, and occupational accident and accidental death insurance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although industry-backed polls show many gig workers voted for Proposition 22 and have benefited from some of its provisions, gig workers continue to complain about their pay and working conditions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In April, \u003ca href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2024/04/uber-lyft-drivers-rally-at-mission-safeway-to-demand-higher-pay/\">drivers protested, as they have many times\u003c/a>, at Uber and Lyft headquarters in San Francisco. They said they were there because of low wages, safety concerns and &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-and-lyft-drivers-are-facing-discrimination-from-customers-and-getting-banned-from-the-apps-report-finds-5b6513dc\">deactivations\u003c/a>&rdquo; &mdash; getting kicked off the apps and losing their ability to work, sometimes suddenly and without knowing why.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for drivers to make ends meet,&rdquo; said Cesar Palancares, a field organizer for Bay Area-based worker-advocacy groups Gig Workers Rising and Working Partnerships USA, and a leader of the protests. Nowadays, he said, &ldquo;Drivers often have to work 12 hours to earn what they used to earn working six or seven hours.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Palancares said pay is still low because workers&rsquo; eligibility for the earnings guarantee is based on the time they agree to take on a gig and the time they spend on that ride or delivery, but not on the time they spend waiting for a gig.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United is so concerned about gig-worker pay that it plans to push for pay standards, like those in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/5/18127208/new-york-uber-lyft-minimum-wage\">New York City\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-and-lyft-get-their-first-legislative-win-in-campaign-to-write-new-labor-laws-11648820705\">Seattle\u003c/a>, even if Proposition 22 is overturned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We want to build pay regulation on top of labor rights, specifically catering to how we work in this industry,&rdquo; said Nicole Moore, president of Rideshare Drivers United, which plans to advocate for legislation or ordinances that would establish a rate card with a minimum rate based on miles and minutes driven.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve learned from NYC is you can set a rate card, and you can have data from the companies that ensures that pay is high enough so your expenses are being covered,&rdquo; Moore said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gig industry&rsquo;s current estimates for average worker earnings differ widely from labor groups&rsquo; estimates: A DoorDash spokesperson said delivery workers&rsquo; average earnings were $36 an hour last year; an Uber spokesperson said its drivers&rsquo; average earnings were $33 &ldquo;per utilized hour&rdquo; as of the fourth quarter of last year. Industry-wide, Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for Protect App-Based Drivers + Services, said that in 2022, &#8203;&#8203;California drivers earned an average of $34.46 per &ldquo;active hour,&rdquo; including tips, an increase of 26% compared with pre-Proposition 22 times.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, labor groups and academics have long disputed those figures, including in the legal briefs they submitted before the Supreme Court hearing because companies do not count the time gig workers wait for an actual ride or delivery. They also say the industry figures don&rsquo;t factor in workers&rsquo; costs for fuel, maintaining their vehicles, health care costs &mdash; not all gig workers are eligible for the stipends &mdash; and more. A study by National Equity Atlas and others, done in 2021 after Proposition 22 took effect, found that the workers&rsquo; average earnings were \u003ca href=\"https://nationalequityatlas.org/prop22-paystudy\">as little as $6.20 an hour\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Oral arguments&rsquo; focus\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>The SEIU and the four gig-worker plaintiffs will argue that the state constitution grants the Legislature &ldquo;unlimited power to enforce a complete workers&rsquo; compensation system.&rdquo; The Legislature already spoke when it passed AB 5, they say. So they contend that &ldquo;the Legislature&rsquo;s exercise of that power can be withdrawn only by a constitutional amendment.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The interveners and appellants &mdash; the gig companies and the state, which is required to defend the law &mdash; will argue that the Legislature&rsquo;s &ldquo;plenary,&rdquo; or absolute, power over workers&rsquo; comp is not exclusive. And they will say no subject is beyond the scope of the initiative process.[aside tag=\"gig-workers\" label=\"More Related Stories\"]\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;The legal issue is actually pretty straightforward,&rdquo; said Kurt Oneto, a lawyer for the gig companies. Oneto said a constitutional amendment adopted by California voters in 1918 that gave the Legislature power over workers&rsquo; comp &ldquo;unlimited by any provision&rdquo; in the constitution was &ldquo;only enacted to prevent courts from invalidating workers&rsquo; comp&rdquo; &mdash; not to limit voters&rsquo; power over it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This decision could set a national precedent in the nagging issue of worker classification.

Proposition 22 was the industry&rsquo;s response to \u003ca href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5\">Assembly Bill 5\u003c/a>, a state law that codified a state Supreme Court decision that would have required the companies \u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/economy/2019/09/whos-in-whos-out-of-ab-5/\">to classify those workers as employees\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Treating gig workers as independent contractors is central to the business model of the California-based companies, the middlemen who gave rise to the on-demand, app-based gig economy that has permeated our culture. The companies are fighting to hang on to that model, saying it helps them provide gig workers with flexible schedules. Critics say it lets the companies avoid paying employment taxes and shift financial responsibility to their workers and customers, plus governments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2021, a Superior Court judge \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-20/prop-22-unconstitutional\">invalidated Proposition 22\u003c/a>, saying it limits the Legislature&rsquo;s constitutional power to create and enforce a complete workers&rsquo; compensation system because it declares gig workers independent contractors ineligible for the benefit. While the state Supreme Court will be considering this narrow issue, because of a clause in the initiative, it&rsquo;s possible the whole law will be thrown out because of it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gig companies appealed the judge&rsquo;s decision, and a state appeals court ruled 2 to 1 \u003ca href=\"https://calmatters.org/economy/2023/03/prop-22-appeal/\">in their favor\u003c/a> last year.

After it became law, app-based platform workers became eligible for some benefits, such as guaranteed weekly earnings of 120% of minimum wage, health care stipends, and occupational accident and accidental death insurance.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Although industry-backed polls show many gig workers voted for Proposition 22 and have benefited from some of its provisions, gig workers continue to complain about their pay and working conditions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In April, \u003ca href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2024/04/uber-lyft-drivers-rally-at-mission-safeway-to-demand-higher-pay/\">drivers protested, as they have many times\u003c/a>, at Uber and Lyft headquarters in San Francisco. They said they were there because of low wages, safety concerns and &ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-and-lyft-drivers-are-facing-discrimination-from-customers-and-getting-banned-from-the-apps-report-finds-5b6513dc\">deactivations\u003c/a>&rdquo; &mdash; getting kicked off the apps and losing their ability to work, sometimes suddenly and without knowing why.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for drivers to make ends meet,&rdquo; said Cesar Palancares, a field organizer for Bay Area-based worker-advocacy groups Gig Workers Rising and Working Partnerships USA, and a leader of the protests. Nowadays, he said, &ldquo;Drivers often have to work 12 hours to earn what they used to earn working six or seven hours.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Palancares said pay is still low because workers&rsquo; eligibility for the earnings guarantee is based on the time they agree to take on a gig and the time they spend on that ride or delivery, but not on the time they spend waiting for a gig.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United is so concerned about gig-worker pay that it plans to push for pay standards, like those in \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/5/18127208/new-york-uber-lyft-minimum-wage\">New York City\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-and-lyft-get-their-first-legislative-win-in-campaign-to-write-new-labor-laws-11648820705\">Seattle\u003c/a>, even if Proposition 22 is overturned.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;We want to build pay regulation on top of labor rights, specifically catering to how we work in this industry,&rdquo; said Nicole Moore, president of Rideshare Drivers United, which plans to advocate for legislation or ordinances that would establish a rate card with a minimum rate based on miles and minutes driven.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve learned from NYC is you can set a rate card, and you can have data from the companies that ensures that pay is high enough so your expenses are being covered,&rdquo; Moore said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The gig industry&rsquo;s current estimates for average worker earnings differ widely from labor groups&rsquo; estimates: A DoorDash spokesperson said delivery workers&rsquo; average earnings were $36 an hour last year; an Uber spokesperson said its drivers&rsquo; average earnings were $33 &ldquo;per utilized hour&rdquo; as of the fourth quarter of last year. Industry-wide, Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for Protect App-Based Drivers + Services, said that in 2022, &#8203;&#8203;California drivers earned an average of $34.46 per &ldquo;active hour,&rdquo; including tips, an increase of 26% compared with pre-Proposition 22 times.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, labor groups and academics have long disputed those figures, including in the legal briefs they submitted before the Supreme Court hearing because companies do not count the time gig workers wait for an actual ride or delivery. They also say the industry figures don&rsquo;t factor in workers&rsquo; costs for fuel, maintaining their vehicles, health care costs &mdash; not all gig workers are eligible for the stipends &mdash; and more. A study by National Equity Atlas and others, done in 2021 after Proposition 22 took effect, found that the workers&rsquo; average earnings were \u003ca href=\"https://nationalequityatlas.org/prop22-paystudy\">as little as $6.20 an hour\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Oral arguments&rsquo; focus\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>The SEIU and the four gig-worker plaintiffs will argue that the state constitution grants the Legislature &ldquo;unlimited power to enforce a complete workers&rsquo; compensation system.&rdquo; The Legislature already spoke when it passed AB 5, they say. So they contend that &ldquo;the Legislature&rsquo;s exercise of that power can be withdrawn only by a constitutional amendment.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The interveners and appellants &mdash; the gig companies and the state, which is required to defend the law &mdash; will argue that the Legislature&rsquo;s &ldquo;plenary,&rdquo; or absolute, power over workers&rsquo; comp is not exclusive.

Oneto said a constitutional amendment adopted by California voters in 1918 that gave the Legislature power over workers&rsquo; comp &ldquo;unlimited by any provision&rdquo; in the constitution was &ldquo;only enacted to prevent courts from invalidating workers&rsquo; comp&rdquo; &mdash; not to limit voters&rsquo; power over it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This decision could set a national precedent in the nagging issue of worker classification.
