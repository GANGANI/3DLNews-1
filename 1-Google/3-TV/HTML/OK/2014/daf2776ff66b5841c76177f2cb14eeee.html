<p></p>MADILL, OK -- Tragedy strikes a Texoma family for the second time in less than a week, as a second daughter dies following a car crash near a softball tournament.<br/><br/>A wake was held tonight for an 11-year-old girl killed in a wreck while away in western Oklahoma. She was there playing on a Johnston County softball team.<br/><br/>The team, the Tishomingo Shockers, was so happy to be playing in a state tournament. But one family up in Beckham County for the event got in a bad wreck. Today the second girl involved in the accident died from her injuries.<br/><br/>The bond between mother and daughter, and between sisters, and the pain of losing them.<br/><br/>"Makes you rethink life and what's most important," says family friend Chad Coleman.<br/><br/>A wake for Kari Baker, 11, in Madill, turned into a night to remember not just Kari, but also her 12-year-old sister Kelli.<br/><br/>"I met her at the Boys and Girls Club last year and we became really good friends," says Kari's friend Bethany Coleman.<br/><br/>Coleman is learning about death at a young age, saying goodbye to her friend who she called "Kare Bear."<br/><br/>Kari had just completed the 4th grade at Tishomingo Elementary School.<br/><br/>Tishomingo Shockers coach and Middle School principal Charles Hook says it was Kelli, who just finished 6th grade this year, who was on his 12-and-under team.<br/><br/>They were playing at the OK Kids Baseball Association's state softball tournament in Hobart. Her sister and mom were tagging along.<br/><br/>Troopers say the Bakers were driving from their hotel when at an intersection, they turned into the path of a semi. In an instant, Kari was gone.<br/><br/>Mother Cathy -- treated and released in Elk City -- rushed to Kelli's bedside in Oklahoma City. <br/><br/>Since Friday, friends and family have been pulling for Kelli to pull through. Then came word on Wednesday that she too is gone.<br/><br/>"I think it's horrible. I think it's a tragedy. I mean no parent should bury their kids," says parent Quinton Huls.<br/><br/>At the Boys and Girls Club where Cathy baker works as a program aide, there were tears on Wednesday after they learned their co-worker lost not one daughter, but both.<br/><br/>Now, adults and children alike struggle to understand. <br/><br/>"And her sister was close to me too so it's hard to just know that she's not here anymore," says Bethany Coleman.<br/><br/>Kari's funeral is set for Thursday at 2 p.m. at First Baptist Church in Madill and burial at Shay Cemetery.<br/><br/>There's no word yet on funeral arrangements for Kelli. <br/><br/><div class="wnFooter">
