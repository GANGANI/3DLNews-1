<p></p><p>MARSHALL COUNTY, OK -- A deadly crash in Marshall County claims the lives of three people, including two children.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>The wreck shut down the highway between Ardmore and Madill for several hours Tuesday morning.</p><p>Commuters on Highway 70 could only wait as emergency crews worked near Simpson Road just west of Madill.  </p><p>"I just seen that they closed the road off and there was a helicopter," said Vicki Woodruff. </p><p>The highway was shut down around 9:30 when troopers say 29 year old Todd Leonard of Oklahoma City and two of his three children, a three year  old and a one year old, were killed. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>They say it happened when the  family was hit by a westbound semi while it was trying to avoid another  vehicle that was turning.  </p><p>"He locked up his breaks, and in an attempt to avoid those vehicles causing him to travel left of center," said Lieutenant Darian Galloway.</p><p> Galloway says the third child was flown to a hospital in Oklahoma City.  </p><p>"Well, you just think of the family," said Donald Robertson.</p><p> Donald Robertson who lives on property just south of the highway says he&#39;s had a couple close calls.</p><p>"People cause the accidents," said Robertson. "Breaking the law, not respecting the law." </p><p>Captain Ronnie Hampton of OHP says the 9.2 mile piece of Highway 70 that  runs from Oakland to the Carter County line, is a deadly stretch of  road.  </p><p>Since January of 1997, there have been a total of 16 fatal collisions. Killing 29 people and injuring 17 more.  </p><p>Troopers say to improve safety, rumble strips have been added on the sides of the highway.  </p><p>Recently, ODOT added another.  </p><p>"To heighten people&#39;s sense of awareness the department of transportation has put one on the center of the roadway," said Lt. Galloway.</p><p>But it will be some time before data is available to see if they are effective.    </p><p>OHP says the accident is still under investigation.  </p><p>According to the Marshall County sheriff&#39;s office, they believe the 7 year old is going to be ok.</p><div class="wnFooter">
