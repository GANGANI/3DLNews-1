Heavy rain, lightning, damaging winds, and quarter to golf ball size hail are the main threats with the leading line of storms. A level 2 out of 5 risk is in place to account for these threats. Flooding will be a higher threat as 1-2 inches of rain has already fallen for some with an additional inch or more possible. Temperatures are expected to vary due to rain - some could be as cool as the upper 60s later this afternoon.&nbsp;\u003c/p> \u003cp>\u003cstrong>Looking Ahead&nbsp;\u003c/strong>- Storm chances linger through midweek next week. The second round of thunderstorms could move in closer to 10 PM Thursday night. This round could last through mid-morning Friday with lingering isolated storm chances through Friday evening. A slight risk is in place for the entire area Friday with a 60 MPH wind and quarter size hail threat. A level 1 risk is also in place for all of Texoma Saturday with a 60 MPH wind and quarter size hail threat. Low-end rain and storm chances last through at least next Wednesday with temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.

Flooding will be a higher threat as 1-2 inches of rain has already fallen for some with an additional inch or more possible. Temperatures are expected to vary due to rain - some could be as cool as the upper 60s later this afternoon.&nbsp;\u003c/p> \u003cp>\u003cstrong>Looking Ahead&nbsp;\u003c/strong>- Storm chances linger through midweek next week. The second round of thunderstorms could move in closer to 10 PM Thursday night. This round could last through mid-morning Friday with lingering isolated storm chances through Friday evening. A slight risk is in place for the entire area Friday with a 60 MPH wind and quarter size hail threat. A level 1 risk is also in place for all of Texoma Saturday with a 60 MPH wind and quarter size hail threat.
