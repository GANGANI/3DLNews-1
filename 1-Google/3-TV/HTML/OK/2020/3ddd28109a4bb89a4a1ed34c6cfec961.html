A low, but non-zero tornado threat exists for Thursday. A third round of severe storms could linger into Friday afternoon/evening. A level 2 risk is in place for both Thursday and Friday. Up to 3 to 5 inches of rain is possible over the next 7 days, so flash flooding will continue to be a huge threat for Texoma. Isolated storm chances linger through the weekend and into the start of next week. Turn Around, Don&#39;t Drown when encountering a flooded road!
