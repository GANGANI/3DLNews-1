<p></p><p>IDABEL, OK -- A McCurtain County jury has convicted a man whose wife disappeared a decade ago. </p>
<p>The husband told Valliant police back on February 26, 2002, that his 25-year-old wife had been missing since February 21. Now, on a Wednesday afternoon more than ten years later, a jury of seven men and five women has decided that he killed her. </p>
<p>Waiting for the verdict, family and friends of Jerry Meek said they didn&#39;t believe he killed his wife. "I don&#39;t think the boy done anything," says stepmom Paulette Meek.</p>
<p>"Has this been difficult for you to watch him go though this?" KTEN asked. "Sure, because his future&#39;s up for grabs," says dad Terry Meek.</p>
<p>Jerry Meek, 40, of Valliant, heard the guilty verdict and recommended sentence of life with parole on the eighth day of trial, after having testified on Monday.</p>
<p>"He just talked about his life with Hope, how it was," says Paulette Meek. "The good, bad, and the ugly. ...We weren&#39;t allowed to have much time with the kids or to be around them, she didn&#39;t approve of them visiting his family."</p>
<p>"We didn&#39;t get to come around there. She wouldn&#39;t let the Christians hang around," says Terry Meek, regarding visits to their Valliant home.</p>
<p>According to court documents, investigators interviewed one of the couple&#39;s children, who told them that her mother and father had been fighting, and that she believed the fight ended when her mother became quiet.</p>
<p>The child went on to state that she and her brother had to help their dad cut some carpet in the bedroom, documents state. They went a lot of places including fishing and camping, and Jerry Meek allegedly dumped the carpet near Hochatown. </p>
<p>On Feb. 21, 2002, Jerry was absent from work, and was caught on surveillance tape around 1 p.m. buying two fifty-gallon totes from the Hugo Wal-Mart, investigators stated. He&#39;d just withdrawn $1,000 in cash from his bank account in Valliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The day before on Feb. 20, Hope had allegedly called Jerry&#39;s work -- the Valliant paper mill -- accusing him of having had an affair with a co-worker. Investigators say she told her brother in one of her last recorded calls that she was looking for his mistress.</p>
<p>Hope Meek&#39;s body was never found. After five hours of deliberation, the jury delivered a guilty verdict which was read around 5:30 p.m. </p>
<p>"It&#39;s been a long two weeks," says Paulette Meek. Jerry Meek&#39;s dad says Hope&#39;s Wiccan beliefs conflicted with theirs and that was one reason they couldn&#39;t visit. One of Hope&#39;s relatives from Florida testified earlier in the trial but her family was not there on Wednesday, Jerry&#39;s family said.</p>
<p>Formal sentencing is set for December 11.</p>
