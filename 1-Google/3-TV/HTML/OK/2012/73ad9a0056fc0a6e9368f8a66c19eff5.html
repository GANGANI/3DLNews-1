<p></p><p>SHERMAN, TX -- A man accused of beating his own mother to death was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison, and prosecutors say marijuana helped fuel the crime.</p>
<p>Jurors deliberated for a little over an hour before finding John Saxon, 30,&nbsp;guilty of murder and arson on Thursday afternoon. Later, they sentenced him to 80 years in prison on each count, but the terms will be served at the same time.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Mary Saxon, 47,&nbsp;kicked her son out two days before the&nbsp;murder last October because she did not want him to use marijuana or alcohol in the house.&nbsp;"Two days after Mary Saxon gave him the boot, he murdered her," said prosecutor Donnie Carter.</p>
<p>In a videotaped confession, John Saxon admits to pulling a 4-year-old nephew out of Mary&#39;s bed,&nbsp;before beating&nbsp;her with a shovel.&nbsp;Prosecutors say he also slit her throat and set&nbsp;her Denison house on fire.</p>
<p>John Saxon&#39;s attorney, Joe N. Smith, tried to prove he was insane when he killed his mother, and therefore not responsible for his actions. Several friends and&nbsp;relatives took the stand for the punishment phase, right before jurors decided the sentence.</p>
<p>The third and final day of testimony wrapped up with a prosecution psychiatrist, Dr. Victor Scarano, who said that Saxon&#39;s delusions&nbsp;-- like saying his mother was injecting him with needles under his arms -- were caused by smoking marijuana.&nbsp;"In my opinion, if Mr. Saxon had not been on cannabis and developing a delusion, he would never have murdered his mother," Scarano said.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Scarano, Saxon&#39;s delusions were temporary, but Smith pointed to the testimony of two other psychiatrists on Wednesday that the delusions were more chronic in nature, arguing that he was instead insane. "Marijuana did not cause him to do what he did to his mother," said Smith. "Insanity did." </p>
<p>Under the law being in an "intoxicated" state is not a defense for the crime.&nbsp;Smith argued that Saxon was not intoxicated but insane, in part because he immediately admitted to a sheriff&#39;s deputy in Southmayd&nbsp;that he committed the crime.&nbsp; "To me that shows someone who had no clue what was going on," Smith said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Kerye Ashmore&nbsp;argued that Saxon was a chronic marijuana user, who was clean while in the military in Iraq, but began using marijuana again after he lost his construction job when his company went bankrupt in 2009.&nbsp;"This defendant hasn&#39;t been a problem unless he&#39;s smoking marijuana, and then he&#39;s a big problem," Ashmore said.</p>
<p>Saxon has three children with his ex-wife,&nbsp;who says their relationship broke up before the murder because of behavior that she believes was undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. "He was in my face, militant like, had his hands behind his back and screaming in my face and you can&#39;t live with it like that," Krystal Saxon says. "I&nbsp;wanted him to get help and he did but the help he got from the&nbsp;V.A., it was just pills."</p><div class="wnFooter">
