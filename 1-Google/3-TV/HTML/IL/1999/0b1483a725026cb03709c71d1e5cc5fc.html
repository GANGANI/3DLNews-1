I grew up watching Dick Johnson and Allison Rosati on NBC5 Chicago and Dan Roan on WGN. Seeing them reporting on TV was interesting and I pictured myself being in their shoes one day. \nJournalists play an important role in the community. We keep everyone informed by reporting on the issues that matter in addition to telling both sides of a story. While the audience associates the station with their reporters/anchors, those who work behind the scenes are just as important to help build relationships with our community and our clients.\n\nI enjoy walking outside, watching sports, and hanging out with friends. I know it sounds cliché but my friends and family are the most important people in my life. Those in my family are my biggest supporters because they are with me through the ups and downs. My friends are also important because they are there to keep me positive.

His first role at WIFR was sports director, and he transitioned to news anchor a few years later.\n\n“I’ve always been someone who really enjoys sharing stories with those I care about. And I really care about the Rockford community and love the ability to share information and insight on what’s important to the Stateline.\"\n\nHe also met his wife, Kirsten (a Hononegah High School alum), at college. They now have four children: Keenan, Kiah, Larson and Braylon. Mike calls them the most important people in his life. “They are the first consideration in every decision I make. They are simply what matter most.”\n\nMike takes his role as a journalist very seriously, saying it is an important job in the community.\n\n“[It is the role of the journalist] to be the presenter of information, not the shaper of viewpoints. We have the ability to ask important questions of decision makers, and we don’t take that opportunity lightly. We also are obligated to show how a story, press release or other sourced information impacts the community. It’s our job to humanize issues and news of the day to make the community understand why this would be important and impactful to them.”\n\nWhen he’s not at work, Mike loves playing and watching sports, playing games and cards, traveling, playing trivia, spending time at his family’s Northwoods Wisconsin cabin and following his four kids around the Midwest doing whatever they are passionate about.\n\nBIGGEST INFLUENCE: My mom taught me so many of my best virtues. The biggest being to enjoy every moment to the fullest and take your responsibilities seriously, but never take yourself too seriously.\n\nFAVORITE DRINK: Do Grasshoppers count? Otherwise, a nice ice-cold glass of water. (Boring, I know.)\n\nFAVORITE ENTREE: My special family recipe for beef stroganoff or pizza.\n\nFAVORITE DESSERT: Hot fudge sundae.\n\nFAVORITE HOLIDAY: Thanksgiving. Great food, spending time with family and it just starts the Christmas season. To me, the build-up to Christmas is even better than the day itself.\n\nFAVORITE SEASON: Easily, it’s fall. The smells (leaves and cookouts), the sweatshirt weather, the football, my anniversary (Sept. 18), a huge fan of fall foliage. I just like the overall mood I’m in when it’s fall.\n\nFAVORITE SPORT: Tough one, because I love them all. To watch: football and college basketball. To play: tennis and basketball. To study: baseball and football.\n\nFAVORITE MOVIES: “Goodwill Hunting,\" \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Fletch.” In that order.\n\nFAVORITE BOOK/AUTHOR: I am more into non-fiction. Maybe \"Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga.\"\n\nMOST DARING FEAT: The most recent thing I can think of is singing \"O, Canada\" with Mark Henderson at a Rockford Ice Hog’s game. I’m not what you would call a \"strong singer,\" and I would say it’s the first time I’ve sang in front of a large group of people since 8th grade choir, 35 years ago.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"type":"author","custom_gray_stationname":"wifr","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-11-14T14:04:04.797Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T03:14:19.293Z","description":{"basic":"Lucy's #7 Burger Bar, known for it's stuffed burgers, is flipping the script for one day offering smash burgers."},"headlines":{"basic":"Lucy’s #7 Burger Bar hopes one-day-only offering is a “smash” success","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/4GNdp9A4fA01faXQqB92Kxo019o=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"SMASH.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4.jpg","owner":"mike.garrigan@wifr.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/4GNdp9A4fA01faXQqB92Kxo019o=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/4GNdp9A4fA01faXQqB92Kxo019o=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/xIbXJlJJICfMaqNEFC3_KknEcYY=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/R4VSV7ZBWFCTNCD6BUW2J5DVD4.jpg","usage_instructions":"none","version":1,"template_id":32,"focal_point":{"max":[972,677],"min":[972,677]}},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"2b64418f91f4407f741a891edc672182d455f286f2eef2b4dcaa82233f1f9a3e"},"caption":"The Beloit burger bar is offering a one-day only menu flip, Thursday, May 30.

I have my BA in Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts with a Minor in Film Studies. \n\nWHY DID YOU GET INTO THE NEWS (OR SPORTS) BUSINESS/BECOME A JOURNALIST: I didn't mean to get involved in journalism. It has always been something that I respect, but I never saw myself working in the news. Look at me now! I work for the news and I love every second of it!\n\nFAVORITE THING ABOUT BEING A JOURNALIST: The team in the newsroom. I work primarily with our social media pages, so I love throwing ideas around and having fun with it. \n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF A JOURNALIST AND A TELEVISION STATION IN OUR COMMUNITY: Our job is to inform our incredible community of everything that going on. Our primary focus is our community. \nI grew up with the mindset that Rockford is a bad place. It didn't take long for me to realize that I was completely wrong. Rockford is a lovely town with a lot to offer its community!\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO OUTSIDE WORK: To relax, I like to watch miscellaneous videos on YouTube, play video games with friends, watch movies, and spend time with my family.\nI like to make music. I do the occasional show in Chicago. When I was living in Fort Collins, Colorado, I did a handful of shows. The local music scene is really hyped up and supported by the locals. \n\nWHO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON/PEOPLE – OR ANIMAL - IN YOUR LIFE AND WHY: My parents, of course! I am very lucky to have a great relationship with my family. My parents, sister, and I are super close.\nBut I don't want to give the expected answer to this question... I am going to say that my buddy Seth Anderson is the most important person in my life. Why? Because he's a once-in-a-lifetime human you get to meet. There is no one like Sethy. \n\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW: Everyone that I know personally will know this, but I am a HUGE cat person. Dogs are cool, but cats are top-tier animals. \n\nWHO HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN YOUR LIFE AND WHY: My sister, Maddie. She has supported every strange hobby I have ever had and keeps tabs on me every day. \n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DRINK: Diet Pepsi (Hot take, I know. You can direct your hate mail to @forrestnelson23 on X or Instagram)\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DINNER ENTREE: Italian Beef sandwiches \n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT: To quote the incomparable artist Future, \"I love cheesecake.\"\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY AND WHY: Thanksgiving. Food + Family = Happy Forrest.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SEASON AND WHY: Fall. I love a hoodie.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SPORT: League of Legends\n\nNAME THREE OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES: The Social Network, Minding the Gap, Marcel the Shell with Shoes on. \n\nNAME YOUR FAVORITE BOOK/AUTHOR: The last book I remember reading was one of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books in grade school. \n\nWHAT IS THE MOST DARING THING YOU’VE DONE: I have never taken a risk in my life.

He is seen broadcasting on location two to three times a week promoting local businesses and showing off the proud accomplishments of the region. Aaron has logged in thousands of live remotes. Some include: Living at Rock Cut State Park for a week, An RV Adventure to Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse, Mississppi Gulf Coast, New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. Live broadcasts from Yellowknife in the North West Territories, Cancun Mexico, Six Flags Great America, Wisconsin Dells, and Quincy Illinois.

I grew up watching Dick Johnson and Allison Rosati on NBC5 Chicago and Dan Roan on WGN. Seeing them reporting on TV was interesting and I pictured myself being in their shoes one day. \nJournalists play an important role in the community. We keep everyone informed by reporting on the issues that matter in addition to telling both sides of a story. While the audience associates the station with their reporters/anchors, those who work behind the scenes are just as important to help build relationships with our community and our clients.\n\nI enjoy walking outside, watching sports, and hanging out with friends. I know it sounds cliché but my friends and family are the most important people in my life. Those in my family are my biggest supporters because they are with me through the ups and downs. My friends are also important because they are there to keep me positive. My mom, dad, and younger brother Rocco are the biggest influences in my life because they have been with me since the start and support me through thick and thin.\n\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW: I've had five wisdom teeth pulled.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DRINK: Raspberry Iced Tea\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DINNER ENTREE: Penne Alla Vodka\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT: Concrete Mixer with Reese's Cups\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY AND WHY: Christmas because I get to spend quality time with both sides of my family.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SEASON AND WHY: Probably spring because it's when the warm weather begins to roll in. Anytime it's sunny and in the 70s is the ideal weather for me.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SPORT: Ice Hockey\n\nNAME THREE OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES: Miracle, Whiplash, Talladega Nights.\n\nWHAT IS THE MOST DARING THING YOU’VE DONE: I've gone zip lining in the Dominican

She started her career as WIFR's social media coordinator in 2012. In 2017, Laura left Rockford and became the digital content manager for the CBS affiliate in Milwaukee. Laura returned to WIFR in 2021 and has since held the roles of assignment editor, managing editor and digital content manager. \n\nLaura often says she fell into the news industry by accident. She started at the station hoping to get some real-world job experience while she figured out her next step. Instead, she fell in love with being able to share the stories from her community and the adrenaline rush of breaking news. She is also fascinated by the ever-changing world of digital media. \n\nDuring her decade in local news, Laura has covered deadly tornadoes, kidnapping cases, cold case breakthroughs and multiple presidential visits. She says journalists have a responsibility to tell people what's going on in their community and recognizes that at a time when it's easier than ever to spread misinformation, local news is vital in helping viewers decipher fact from fiction. \n\nLaura loves spending time with family, friends and her cat, Kitty (yes, that's really her name). When she's not at work, Laura enjoys catching up on her favorite TV shows, curling up with a good book or teaching herself a new skill from TikTok or YouTube. She also loves cooking, baking and experimenting with different cuisines.

I have my BA in Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts with a Minor in Film Studies. \n\nWHY DID YOU GET INTO THE NEWS (OR SPORTS) BUSINESS/BECOME A JOURNALIST: I didn't mean to get involved in journalism. It has always been something that I respect, but I never saw myself working in the news. Look at me now! I work for the news and I love every second of it!\n\nFAVORITE THING ABOUT BEING A JOURNALIST: The team in the newsroom. I work primarily with our social media pages, so I love throwing ideas around and having fun with it. \n\nWHAT IS THE ROLE OF A JOURNALIST AND A TELEVISION STATION IN OUR COMMUNITY: Our job is to inform our incredible community of everything that going on. Our primary focus is our community. \nI grew up with the mindset that Rockford is a bad place. It didn't take long for me to realize that I was completely wrong. Rockford is a lovely town with a lot to offer its community!\n\nWHAT DO YOU DO OUTSIDE WORK: To relax, I like to watch miscellaneous videos on YouTube, play video games with friends, watch movies, and spend time with my family.\nI like to make music. I do the occasional show in Chicago. When I was living in Fort Collins, Colorado, I did a handful of shows. The local music scene is really hyped up and supported by the locals. \n\nWHO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON/PEOPLE – OR ANIMAL - IN YOUR LIFE AND WHY: My parents, of course! I am very lucky to have a great relationship with my family. My parents, sister, and I are super close.\nBut I don't want to give the expected answer to this question... I am going to say that my buddy Seth Anderson is the most important person in my life. Why? Because he's a once-in-a-lifetime human you get to meet. There is no one like Sethy. \n\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW: Everyone that I know personally will know this, but I am a HUGE cat person. Dogs are cool, but cats are top-tier animals. \n\nWHO HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN YOUR LIFE AND WHY: My sister, Maddie. She has supported every strange hobby I have ever had and keeps tabs on me every day. \n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DRINK: Diet Pepsi (Hot take, I know. You can direct your hate mail to @forrestnelson23 on X or Instagram)\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DINNER ENTREE: Italian Beef sandwiches \n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT: To quote the incomparable artist Future, \"I love cheesecake.\"\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY AND WHY: Thanksgiving. Food + Family = Happy Forrest.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SEASON AND WHY: Fall. I love a hoodie.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SPORT: League of Legends\n\nNAME THREE OF YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES: The Social Network, Minding the Gap, Marcel the Shell with Shoes on. \n\nNAME YOUR FAVORITE BOOK/AUTHOR: The last book I remember reading was one of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books in grade school. \n\nWHAT IS THE MOST DARING THING YOU’VE DONE: I have never taken a risk in my life.

As a kid, his favorite segments on WGN-TV in Chicago were Dean’s List with Dean Richards and Sports with Pat Tomasulo. \n\nAfter studying journalism at Illinois State University, Jake began his career at WIFR-TV in May of 2023. \n\nJake says his favorite moments in his career so far include meeting Jodi Benson from Disney's The Little Mermaid and interviewing UAW Local 1268 President Matt Frantzen live in November 2023, as news broke that Belvidere’s Stellantis assembly plant would re-open. \n\nHe believes a journalist’s role in a community should be built on strong rapport, capable of performing their job with professionalism while also being a kind person that viewers would call a friend.\n\nOutside of work, Jake loves heading to the movie theater, going to the gym and hanging out with his two brothers — one of whom is his identical twin! \n\nJake loves lounging around with his French bulldog, Kirby, named after one of his favorite video game characters. He has been a big Chicago Bears fan since elementary school and hopes to one day celebrate a Super Bowl win with his family.

Community involvement, and the personal interactions that come out of it, is one of the easiest ways to set ourselves apart. Being a good steward in our community, and a positive role model, go a long way.”\n\nMOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN LIFE: Jesus Christ. He has blessed me with a wonderful family, a tremendous set of friends, the talents to achieve professional success doing the job I love as much today as I did the first day, and so many other blessings too numerous to count.\n\nFAVORITE DRINK: Diet Mt. Dew\n\nFAVORITE ENTREE: Orange chipotle chicken\n\nFAVORITE DESSERT: Oreo cheesecake\n\nFAVORITE HOLIDAY: New Year's Eve/Day. It's always nice to be able to hit the reset button, to celebrate the achievements and highlights of the year that's ending and to set new goals for the year ahead.\n\nFAVORITE SEASON: Hands down, summer! It's the season of baseball, grilling out, picnics, festivals and flip-flops!\n\nFAVORITE SPORT: Baseball. I love all sports, but when push comes to shove, nothing can beat my love for my Chicago Cubs.\n\nFAVORITE MOVIES: I'm a huge fan of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for \"Home Alone.\" Lastly, as a huge Bill Murray fan, I love both \"Groundhog Day\" and \"What About Bob?\"\n\nMOST DARING FEAT: I've participated in Rockford's Polar Plunge more than a dozen times in March, and while that water is ridiculously cold, it is nowhere near as cold as the water I plunged into for a Polar Plunge in St. Germain, Wisconsin, back in 2003, when the temperature at \"plunge\" time was 10 degrees with a wind chill at negative-5 degrees.
