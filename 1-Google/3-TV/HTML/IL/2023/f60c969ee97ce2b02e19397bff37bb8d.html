Dr. Gundry then reveals the 'just one thing' that leads to living well until a ripe old age. The program ends with a step-by-step approach to help us feel better and more youthful today while offering revolutionary, yet simple, methods to losing weight, reducing our need for medications and increasing our healthspan.</p>
