There, he worked his way through multiple roles including production assistant, photographer, multimedia journalist, investigative reporter, and news anchor. Joe also occasionally anchored hourly radio news updates for 93.9 The Eagle FM and other properties of Zimmer Radio & Marketing Group.\n\nIn 2015, Joe earned a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Missouri, emphasizing study in convergence and emerging media. He also earned a certificate in multicultural studies at Mizzou. In 2019, Joe was appointed an adjunct faculty member at the prestigious Missouri School of Journalism, teaching applied projects for journalism and strategic communication. He returned to that teaching role in 2024. Joe is a member of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), the National Association of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ).\n\nIn a brief stint outside the Midwest, Joe covered education, politics, and breaking news in Jacksonville, Florida for News4JAX (WJXT) between 2020 and 2023. He was a frequent guest on WJCT News' ‘First Coast Connect’ Friday Media Round Table, offering analysis and commentary on the week's top stories. His work at News4JAX earned a Regional Emmy Award nomination in the Suncoast Region and went on to be featured in the Academy Award-nominated documentary short film, ‘The ABCs of Book Banning.’ \n\nJoe’s investigative and breaking news reporting also yielded multiple accolades from the Missouri Broadcasters Association, the Kansas City Press Club, and the Florida Association of Broadcast

factor in the forecast over the next 48 hours. High pressure will mean sunny skies on Wednesday with a light wind. That same type of forecast will translate through Thursday so back-to-back days of full sunshine and temperatures in the mid to upper 70s with pleasant low relative humidity. Beyond that, there is disagreement in the forecast models as to how quickly the next round of showers will get here. Some forecast models bring the rain showers in on Thursday night into Friday. Other forecast models hold the rain showers off until Saturday morning. Either way, the showers, and thunderstorms will have to overcome quite a bit of dry air before they make it to the ground and through that area of weakening high pressure. As it stands for now, we will keep some scattered showers in the forecast for Friday, but it’s more likely those showers come through early Saturday morning with a few thunderstorms. They should exit the area by Saturday afternoon making way for what will be a thoroughly pleasant weekend. Sunday could see a few showers also, but a mostly dry day is expected."}],"credits":{"by":[{"_id":"brian.inman","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Brian Inman","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/0ffc2753-efd7-4f50-a3c9-1953529dcd54.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Brian Inman is Chief Meteorologist of the WGEM First Alert Weather Team.

Then, sky conditions will gradually turn partly cloudy as a weak reinforcing cold front slides through the region. Similar to yesterday, after about 2 PM/3 PM, a <u><b>few</b></u> stray showers/storms look to develop. These would start on the northern tier (Lee County, Iowa; Hancock &amp; McDonough County, Illinois; Clark &amp; Scotland County, Missouri) and then drift south/southeastward through the rest of the Tri-States.
