With family in the valley, Jaclyn enjoyed many family reunions and Thanksgiving holidays here; even getting married at Caesars Palace.\n\nJaclyn started her broadcasting career at KOVR in Sacramento as a writer and producer, then made her way to the southeast region. As a reporter for WAGA in Atlanta for six years, she pounded the pavement covering crime and investigating community issues that affected local viewers.  As a field reporter, big stories took her around the country to cover scenes like the tornado-ravaged fields of Oklahoma, wildfires in Arizona and snowstorms in Illinois.\n\nJaclyn credits many mentors for motivating her in the field of journalism and she hopes to return the favor as an active member of the Asian American Journalism Association.\n\nIn her spare time, Jaclyn enjoys exploring new and different restaurants, art galleries and live music. She also has a soft spot for animals and confesses, “I feel like I say ‘hi’ to every dog I meet.” So, feel free to ask for a pet selfie!

His long career started in Iowa in 1991 when the Persian Gulf War broke out.\n\nJoe also worked at television news stations in Lawton, Oklahoma, Lubbock, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico where he spent much of his career. There, Joe covered dozens of wildfires, including the destructive Cerro Grande Fire in Los Alamos that burned many homes. Joe received numerous awards for his reporting in New Mexico.\n\nAfter 16 years in New Mexico Joe then traveled to the Last Frontier, Alaska! As a primary anchor/reporter for KTVA TV he was part of team coverage of November 2018’s 7.1 magnitude earthquake which destroyed homes, businesses and the KTVA newsroom. With cameras knocked over, glass shattered and water dripping from damaged water pipes, news operations continued as KTVA journalists continued to report vital earthquake information to Alaskans. KTVA, including Joe, received two Regional Emmy Awards for coverage of the earthquake. Joe, along with colleagues, also won an Emmy award for a 30-minute special on “The Last Frontier Honor Flight.” Joe traveled with Alaska WWII, Vietnam and Korean War veterans to Washington D.C. to tour their war memorials.\n\n“I was honored to be in the company of men and women who, without hesitation, put their lives on the line for our freedom. I will always be grateful to those who serve.”\n\nJoe says he feels privileged to now serve people in Nevada. He is married with two children, a boy and girl ages 8 and 11. Joe is an avid photographer and is looking forward to finding all the hiking and biking trails around Las Vegas, and golf courses!\n\n“I’ve been golfing decades and both of my kids can now beat me! Maybe I need lessons.”\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kvvu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-04-05T22:41:45.661Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4","type":"author"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T00:57:43.623Z","description":{"basic":"Drivers that are leaving Primm or heading up to Las Vegas Wednesday should prepare with a full charge or tank of gas with cellphones fully charged as a 12-hour outage hits Baker, California."},"headlines":{"basic":"With 12-hour outage in Baker, drivers are urged to gas up, charge","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/RRdFAx831q134Pi9N-YxmcIw72s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/png","originalName":"0528 MAP California Planned Power Outage.png","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","owner":"justine.verastigue@kvvu.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/RRdFAx831q134Pi9N-YxmcIw72s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/RRdFAx831q134Pi9N-YxmcIw72s=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/3kscNgjHtqHLpaU-DLeamfc4bLQ=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","usage_instructions":"Cleared for use","version":0,"template_id":29,"focal_point":{"max":[843,591],"min":[843,591]}},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"72fe2e86bccba56e8659de9a75ea8ff3ccc4d6e6631e868bda31fe9caef91050"},"caption":"Drivers that are leaving Primm or heading up to Las Vegas Wednesday should prepare with a full charge or tank of gas with cellphones fully charged as a 12-hour outage hits Baker, California.","created_date":"2024-05-29T00:57:23Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"FOX5","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":1080,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-29T00:57:23Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Baker power outage","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/GTG3T65OMVBTJM7EVKY5BTKQW4.png","version":"0.10.9","width":1920,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"FOX5"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"kvvu":{"website_section":{"path":"/traffic","_website":"kvvu","name":"Traffic -
