Jennifer Richmond also provided the following statement from Richmond Rogers’ husband, Brian Rogers:</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text"><i>“My wife and I had just spent the last three weeks decorating the house, hanging Christmas lights, buying last minute presents, wrapping presents, watching our kids compete in the state wrestling tournament, and trying to get out all the Christmas cards to friends and family. It was the first Christmas we were celebrating since the passing of Amanda’s father earlier in the year. We wanted to make it special for visiting family and our 4 boys. After spending time with her mother and sister the previous two days, the 23rd was our day. We were married on December 23, 2005, making this our 18th anniversary.</i></p><p class="text | article-text"><i>“We planned to take two of our dogs for a walk, go on a date, and spend the night at the Hotel Captain Cook. It was a beautiful day. We chose to hike at the North Fork of Eagle River trailhead. We had hiked here many times and was one of Amanda’s favorites. We were having an amazing time watching the dogs play, playing with the dogs ourselves, and admiring the beauty of outdoor Alaska during the winter. We visited with a few friends along the way. We stopped at an especially scenic area along the river to admire the view. We were a bit tired so we laid down on the snow covered ice to rest and looked at the blue sky above and the cloud formations above the mountains. The dogs ran and played. A short ways away was a small opening in the ice with water flowing, no more than about 18 inches wide. One of the dogs went over to get a drink and fell into the opening. We ran over to the opening. There was only about a five foot area of uncovered ice downstream from the opening. I thought I saw a flash of a big white paw underneath the ice. Before even thinking, I was jumping into the water to save our dog. I held onto the edge of the ice as I frantically ducked under the ice reaching into darkness trying to feel and grab our dog. I felt nothing. I ran out of breath and jumped out of the opening. I took four steps down stream to look for the dog through the ice again. I turned around and Amanda was getting into the water. I knew from the look on her face she was going in to save our dog.</i></p><p class="text | article-text"><i>“She is an emergency room nurse, trained to help and save people. In this situation she was going to save our dog. I yelled but doubt she even heard me as she was completely concentrating on saving the dog. Before I could get back to the opening to try and grab her I could see her SWIMMING downstream under the ice and then out of sight. I waited and waited and am still waiting. To anyone wondering why we would jump in to save our dog I can only answer, our instincts took over and we went in without thought. Amanda loved her dogs nearly as much as our kids, they were our family. We have a room in our house dedicated to the memory of all our previous dogs. We have tattoos of our dog’s paws. Amanda has around 35 thousand photos and videos on her phone from our 18 years of marriage and a majority of them of our dogs. She did not jump in to save “just a dog,” it was a family member. To me and our 4 boys she died a hero.</i></p><p class="text | article-text"><i>“Amanda was an amazing mother and has raised four tremendous children. She worked as an emergency room nurse, a death scene investigator and a pediatric hospice nurse but the job she excelled at was mom. She enjoyed the outdoors, her family, all animals, and adventure. She has touched so many people’s lives for the better. I could go on and on and on. She was a beautiful person with a beautiful soul.</i></p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text"><i>“Our family would personally like to thank the Rankin family, the first responders who responded that day, Anchorage Police and Alaska State Police, the search and rescue workers who have and will work to recover Mandy, my neighbors, Eagle River, the amazing Alaska State Wrestling community, my colleagues with Alaska Emergency Medicine Associates, the Anchorage Medical Community, Mandy and I’s friends and family, those who have or will send meals, and anyone sending thoughts and prayers. I know I am missing so many people but my brain is still in a fog. It is truly incredible the overwhelming support we have received during our crisis. We are blessed to live in such a special place. Thank you.”</i></p><p class="text | article-text"><b>Sunday 6:10 p.m. update:</b></p><p class="text | article-text">When light returned to the valley, the Alaska Wildlife Troopers along with volunteers with the AK Dive Search Rescue &amp; Recovery Team, were at the North Fork Eagle River Trailhead searching for the woman who went missing Saturday. Those searching were able to get to the site and cut into the ice, allowing the team to deploy technology that may have included divers, sonar and remote operated vehicles underneath the ice. The search on Sunday included several areas of interest that the dive team identified.</p><p class="text | article-text">“It is certainly a tragic event for the family, our thoughts are with them, especially with the closeness to the Christmas holiday,” Austin McDaniel, the Communications Director for Alaska State Troopers, said. “But our focus is finding the missing woman so the family can have some closure.”</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">Rep.

This event is a grave reminder of how quickly situations can turn perilous in natural settings, especially near our river.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Representative Allard encouraged the Chugiak-Eagle River community to come together to support the family. She also thanked the response from emergency services, along with search and rescue and safety teams, who often demonstrate their dedication to public safety.</p><p class="text | article-text">Due to areas of thin ice and open water, the teams are operating their search and rescue operations when it’s safe for them to operate, Troopers said.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">McDaniel said he urges people to be cautious of thin ice when using snow machines, ice skating, ice fishing and crossing bodies of water on foot.</p><p class="text | article-text">“If you’re going to be on any frozen lakes, rivers, other type of waterways, make sure you know the depth of the ice,” McDaniel said. “With the interesting winter we’ve been having in Southcentral, Alaska, there could be a substantial amount of snow on top of very thin ice.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Alaska’s News Source was at the North Fork Eagle River Trailhead on Sunday and talked with authorities and people who were at the scene.

It was a beautiful day. We chose to hike at the North Fork of Eagle River trailhead. We had hiked here many times and was one of Amanda’s favorites. We were having an amazing time watching the dogs play, playing with the dogs ourselves, and admiring the beauty of outdoor Alaska during the winter. We visited with a few friends along the way. We stopped at an especially scenic area along the river to admire the view. We were a bit tired so we laid down on the snow covered ice to rest and looked at the blue sky above and the cloud formations above the mountains. The dogs ran and played. A short ways away was a small opening in the ice with water flowing, no more than about 18 inches wide. One of the dogs went over to get a drink and fell into the opening. We ran over to the opening. There was only about a five foot area of uncovered ice downstream from the opening. I thought I saw a flash of a big white paw underneath the ice. Before even thinking, I was jumping into the water to save our dog. I held onto the edge of the ice as I frantically ducked under the ice reaching into darkness trying to feel and grab our dog. I felt nothing. I ran out of breath and jumped out of the opening. I took four steps down stream to look for the dog through the ice again. I turned around and Amanda was getting into the water.

To anyone wondering why we would jump in to save our dog I can only answer, our instincts took over and we went in without thought. Amanda loved her dogs nearly as much as our kids, they were our family. We have a room in our house dedicated to the memory of all our previous dogs. We have tattoos of our dog’s paws. Amanda has around 35 thousand photos and videos on her phone from our 18 years of marriage and a majority of them of our dogs. She did not jump in to save “just a dog,” it was a family member.

He's lived in nine states and is the youngest of seven kids. He takes pleasure in knowing that his hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, is much colder than Anchorage in the winter. Joe has road trips in his blood, as he likes to say, \"on three sides of his family.\" Now in Alaska, there are only five states he hasn't at least driven through. Joe talks a lot. He's very social and loves people in general. His non travel, non news passions include: playing guitar and singing, writing literature, watching horror movies, checking out \"haunted\" places and cooking. He considers himself an \"amateur chef.\" His favorite news experience was tornado spotting for a legendary country music radio station in Wichita, Kansas. Joe has 27 nieces and nephews. He became a great uncle before turning 30. He has recently published his first horror story and is very proud of that.

While he spent more than one decade working and learning alongside extremely talented Lower 48 journalists, he never stopped missing his Alaska communities, his adopted family and the former co-workers he’d always make time to visit.  Now, he is excited to return North to the Great Land and use his 25 years of journalism experience, and passion for investigative reporting and sharing stories based off the human experience, to help lead the state’s number one television news organization, KTUU-Channel 2 & KYES-CBS5.\n   \nSimon considers his Alaska homecoming to be a very full circle moment, as Alaska’s News Source now combines KTUU & the former KTVA’s operations.  Between 2005-2012 he worked for both stations, respectively, as a political-investigative reporter/anchor, where he also managed both newsrooms on the weekends. His Alaska reporting highlights include covering former governors Frank Murkowski, Sarah Palin, and Sean Parnell's administrations.  He also anchored some of the state’s biggest, historic breaking news stories, including: Sen. John McCain announcing former Gov. Palin as his running mate; the Supreme Court’s Exxon Valdez oil spill ruling; 2009’s Mount Redoubt volcanic eruption, and the last years of one of the most prominent political figures in U.S. history, former Sen. Ted Stevens.  He also provided months of reporting coverage during the series of VECO political corruption trials. And for five years traveled to Juneau to provide gavel-to-gavel legislative session coverage. As a cancer survivor, some of his most important work, during his first Alaska stint, was spent volunteering and reporting on cancer’s impact as Alaska’s number one killer.  He volunteered with the American Cancer Society, Alaska Men’s Run, and Alaska Men’s Retreat boards and committees.  He also spent years sharing his cancer story with Anchorage School District middle schoolers.  His cancer reporting, and community service, was also honored with several Alaska Broadcaster Association awards.\n\nPrior to moving back to Alaska, Simon worked for Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina Lower 48 stations, most recently serving as assistant news director for Ft. Myers, Florida’s WFTX-TV. There he was part of the leadership team that oversaw coverage of the biggest story of his career to date: Category-5 Hurricane Ian’s landfall and direct aftermath across every Southwest Florida community. Simon’s point of pride during this Regional Edward R. Murrow-winning breaking news coverage was his station, and dedicated team, never went off the air. Broadcasting from a remote evacuation site, they rode out the storm with the communities they served. The Florida Association of Broadcast Journalists, FABJ, went onto name WFTX the Community Service Station of the Year. Simon went onto manage the production of the Murrow & FABJ-winning documentary, Hurricane Ian: Still Standing, as executive producer.  The special used the WFTX reporting and meteorologist staff’s perspectives to document Ian's formation, impact and aftermath.  At WFTX, Simon was also responsible for starting and overseeing the station’s investigative unit, which would end up covering months of Ian’s after-effects, on top of leading coverage plans for ongoing water and housing crises and Florida’s trending rise of Antisemitism.\n  \nBefore moving to Florida, in 2019 Simon made the transition from longtime investigative reporter/anchor to newsroom manager when WHIO-TV, America's #1 CBS affiliate, recruited him to oversee the station’s investigations and special reports unit as Special Projects Executive Producer. (Yes: there he had the pleasure of working with former KTUU news anchor James Brown.)  Following exposing how a lack of multi-agency communication led to a child’s death, his team’s award-winning investigative reporting served as the impetus for changing an Ohio state law, which created an ombudsman to investigate similar child abuse cases. Simon was also part of the WHIO leadership team that oversaw breaking news coverage of a mass shooting in downtown Dayton, Ohio’s entertainment area, the Oregon District.  During his nearly three years in Ohio, Simon was part of a team honored with dozens of journalism’s most prestigious awards, including: Regional EMMYs, Regional Edward R. Murrow awards, and Ohio Society of Professional Journalists & Ohio Associated Press accolades.\n \nSimon’s journalism passion started where he grew up in the Birmingham, Alabama suburb Mountain Brook. Thanks to his high school's work study program, he was fortunate to be able to start his TV news career at 16 years old, interning for the next two years with WVTM-TV, at the time owned by the NBC network. For the next 20 years, his respective reporting career stops included Missouri, Kansas, Alaska, North Carolina and Wisconsin. The proud University of Missouri School of Journalism graduate focused his studies on investigative journalism, (the world's premier investigative journalism organization, Investigative Reporters and Editors [IRE], is located at Mizzou). He spent all four college years working for the university-owned NBC affiliate KOMU-TV, where he helped start the station's Target 8 investigative unit, which is still in existence today. His point of pride decades later continues to be championing journalism's founding principal of being a government watchdog. His long track record of reporting on government waste, holding people in power accountable, giving those that feel they do not have a voice an outlet and uncovering personal stories behind trends, he hopes, has led to change for the better in the many communities he has served. In that spirt, he is a proud member of several professional organizations, including: Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE); National Press Photographers Association (NPPA); NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists; and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.\n\nSimon’s Ohio move came after spending five years in Wisconsin, including the last three years working for Alaska News Source Gray-TV sister station, WSAW-TV, in the north central city of Wausau. He was hired to start the station's investigative unit and served for three years as WSAW's senior investigative reporter along with anchoring the 4:00 p.m. newscast. At WSAW, his reporting included exposing a crisis and government coverup inside the state's juvenile justice system, loopholes impacting veterans' emergency care, and the lack of resources for families battling the opioid crisis, which received a regional Edward R. Murrow award.  His first two years in Wisconsin were spent reporting for Madison's WISC-TV, where his investigative reporting on gangs and the opioid epidemic, along with extensive reporting on an officer-involved shooting death, was part of a National Edward R. Murrow and a regional EMMY award for Outstanding Achievement for Media Interactivity. Simon was also part of the investigative team the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association honored for exposing how emergency radio failures were putting first responders' lives at risk. \n\nPrior to his first Alaska move in 2005 to report at KTVA-TV, Simon was a general assignment reporter for Wichita, Kansas’ KAKE-TV, where among much crime news he covered the infamous BTK serial killer's reemergence and capture. His resume also includes news reporter roles at Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina's Spectrum Cable News and in Montgomery, Alabama, at Gray-TV sister station WSFA-TV. \n\nFrom his large adopted Alaska family, to extensive network of people he cares deeply about scattered across the Lower 48, most important to Simon are the loved ones in his life. He survived both testicular cancer at 21 years old, and a massive \"widowmaker\" heart attack at 35 years old. He thinks health education and taking care of yourself is vital. In his free time you'll find him working out most mornings, reading all sorts of books, from a good biography to the best fiction, traveling to his next, new destination, finding healthy food that doesn't taste too healthy, streaming the best TV shows and movies and trying to be Mason’s best fur dad.","slug":"matthew-simon","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-simon-5315533b","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ktuu","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-10-06T02:18:07.061Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1","website_url":"/authors/matthew-simon/"}}},{"_id":"paul.choate","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Paul Choate","org":"Anchorage, AK","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/2cdd2f36-83de-4b73-9df9-a422163e9865.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"","url":null,"slug":"","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"pchoate@ktuu.com"}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"pchoate@ktuu.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"paul.choate","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Choate","byline":"Paul Choate","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/2cdd2f36-83de-4b73-9df9-a422163e9865.jpg","email":"pchoate@ktuu.com","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[{"name":"2022 Alaska Broadcasters Association Goldie Award - KTUU, Use of Digital Media"},{"name":"2020 Edward R.

He spent his time in the classroom learning from industry professionals whose backgrounds ranged from ESPN and FOX Sports to countless local stations. He also produced, directed, and anchored his own shows in the Full Sail broadcast studio.\n\nWhile in school, Tyler worked and attended some of the biggest sporting events in the country, including March Madness and Super Bowl 57. He also interned with DII Rollins College as a Play-By-Play announcer and team reporter for “The Rollins Report.”\n\nBefore Full Sail, Tyler spent four years as a Diesel Mechanic in the United States Marine Corp, serving overseas in Okinawa, Japan and stateside at Camp Pendleton, California. It’s here where daily banter with other Marines about the latest sports news inspired him to pursue the broadcast business altogether.\n\n“Becoming a Marine was a goal of mine from the beginning of my life. But when I saw the opportunity to not only work in sports, but to give back to something that has meant so much to me, I had to take the opportunity … and it’s the greatest decision I ever made.”\n\nWhen he’s not in the studio or out in the field, Tyler spends his free time producing sports edits across his social media pages, exploring the nature of America’s Last Frontier, or catching up on the latest release in the video game world. \n\nIf you’ve got a story that needs to be told, feel free to reach out to Tyler at
