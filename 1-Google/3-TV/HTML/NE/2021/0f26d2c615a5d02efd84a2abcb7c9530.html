Nebraska for nearly three decades. Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at

Since then, he has been fascinated with forecasting, weather patterns, extreme weather and understanding why it all happens.\n\nDavid didn't always want to be on TV. As a high school student, he wanted to work for the National Weather Service. In college, he realized he liked to talk about the weather too much, and the best way to use that was to move on to TV.

All told, the sheriff’s office turned up at least $40,000 in questionable transactions. The fund received money from community donations from events like pancake feeds, in turn used to run essential services, and was not tied to city dollars.

Koeller is a meteorologist for 6 News WOWT, bringing you weather updates in several afternoon and evening newscasts as well as any time severe weather threatens.\n\nWeather has been David's passion from age 5 when he witnessed a tornado touch down not far from his home in Colorado Springs. Since then, he has been fascinated with forecasting, weather patterns, extreme weather and understanding why it all happens.\n\nDavid didn't always want to be on TV. As a high school student, he wanted to work for the National Weather Service. In college, he realized he liked to talk about the weather too much, and the best way to use that was to move on to TV. He said he never gets tired of people asking about the forecast.\n\nAfter living in Colorado, David grew up in Kansas City, Kansas and graduated from Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. He attended St. Louis University beginning in 2008 where he ran the student television station and served as their meteorologist. While at SLU, David interned at Fox 2 and then KMBC 9 in Kansas City. He graduated in May of 2012 and moved to Springfield, Missouri a few months later to serve as the Chief Meteorologist for FOX 5 until September of 2018.\n\nIn his spare time, David enjoys biking and running, spending time outdoors and swimming as well as some occasionally binge watching Netflix or Amazon.\n\nDavid said the weather in Omaha has already proven to be very exciting, and he is looking forward to bringing the forecast to everyone in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wowt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-08-09T20:05:59.300Z","type":"author","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T01:32:08.418Z","description":{"basic":"After

Nebraska for nearly three decades. Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at jacob.lawson@1011now.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"27","custom_gray_stationname":"koln","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-11T16:29:48.546Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:08:59.719Z","description":{"basic":"A grand jury is set to review evidence after an officer-involved shooting left a Columbus boy dead earlier this year."},"headlines":{"basic":"Case involving fatal shooting of Columbus teenager heads to grand jury","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/HmPjx1hyL8F3FnlsgWRE-TnOCII=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","galleries":[],"keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"t_d42edda8dfdc4a2e826bf4033c7cbce9_name_file_1280x720_2000_v3_1_.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/HmPjx1hyL8F3FnlsgWRE-TnOCII=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/HmPjx1hyL8F3FnlsgWRE-TnOCII=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/NushJLKz9nJMM_LG9Ewa1Ov0dLw=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","version":0},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"c07d399772bf8c3f90dfa7739c49b54c18af95c70e4aa39a5f74e4e82d5a3fb8"},"caption":"The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating an incident that turned into an officer-involved shooting on Tuesday.","created_date":"2024-02-06T21:24:43Z","height":720,"last_updated_date":"2024-02-06T21:24:43Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray"},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Nebraska State Patrol investigating officer-involved shooting in Columbus","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/KEQEXHKV4BDG5KIIR7AWT7UCFA.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"imageId":null,"ingestImageToAnglerfish":true,"photographer":null,"usage_instructions":null},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wowt":{"website_section":{"path":"/video/shared","_website":"wowt","name":"Shared Video","_id":"/video/shared","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/29/case-involving-fatal-shooting-columbus-teenager-heads-grand-jury/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wowt","websites":{"wowt":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news/crime","_website":"wowt","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Crime","path":"/news/crime","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/crime","_website":"wowt","name":"Crime","site":{"site_title":"Crime"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Crime"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1049,"navigation-menu-links":2001},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/","/news"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/news"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/crime"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wowt./news/crime"},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/case-involving-fatal-shooting-columbus-teenager-heads-grand-jury/"}},"_id":"MSO63ELGDFHSDEYFS4VCAY2NVY","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/news/crime","_website":"wowt","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Crime","path":"/news/crime","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/crime","_website":"wowt","name":"Crime","site":{"site_title":"Crime"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Crime"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1049,"navigation-menu-links":2001},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/news"],"publishing-sections":["/"],"navigation-menu-links":["/","/news"]},"parent":{"default":"/news","publishing-sections":"/","navigation-menu-links":"/news"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/news/crime"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wowt./news/crime"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/case-involving-fatal-shooting-columbus-teenager-heads-grand-jury/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/29/omahas-henry-doorly-zoo-aquarium-launching-zooventure-experience/","content_elements":[{"_id":"JKJGYMDJCZF43MM7E6VFWZ7RQE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"JSG6NFWQXVEKDLK4H4SZCKJXVM","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"OMAHA, Neb.

August 2022 as a reporter and was promoted to Senior Reporter in February 2024.\n\nJohn grew up in Yutan, Nebraska. While studying at Yutan High School, his journalism teacher inspired him to pursue storytelling in multiple mediums. John stayed with journalism because it allows him to learn a little bit about everything.\n\nJohn graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2021 with a degree in journalism and minors in English, history and political science. He worked as a staff writer for the Beatrice Daily Sun, telling the stories of Gage County and its residents. John joined the 10/11 NOW news team in August 2022 and is excited to learn more about what stories make the Lincoln community tick. \n\nIn his free time, John loves to travel, write, read, watch movies and hang out with family and friends.\n\nIf you have tips or stories for John, reach him at his email address john.grinvalds@1011now.com.

He is originally from Lyndon, Ill., a village of just under 600 people located about 45 minutes northeast of the Quad Cities. While he enjoys the small-town life, Jaret is excited to explore Omaha and all it has to offer. \n\nAs a major foodie, he cannot wait to start checking out the plethora of great restaurants he has heard about in the city. In his free time, Jaret also enjoys cooking, traveling, listening to all kinds of music and learning about history and cultures.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wowt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"4","last_updated_date":"2023-08-25T18:38:51.378Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T16:36:36.216Z","description":{"basic":"Construction
