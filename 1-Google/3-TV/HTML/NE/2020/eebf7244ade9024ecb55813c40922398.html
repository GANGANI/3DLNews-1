He went to high school at Pius X in Lincoln and then attended the University of Nebraska where he majored in Meteorology. \n\nAfter school, he accepted his first job as a meteorologist in Cheyenne, Wyoming. While living out west, Bill married his high school sweetheart Katie in Estes Park, Colorado. By the end of his time in Wyoming, Bill and Katie were expecting their first child, Liam, who was born in the summer of 2016. To be closer to family, Bill and Katie decided to move back home to Lincoln in the fall of 2015, which is when Bill started at 10/11 News. He spent a year as a reporter before moving over full time into the weather department. Shortly after Liam was born in 2016, Bill and Katie were surprised with another baby - Jamie - who was born in the summer of 2017.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2022, Bill worked full time in the weather department covering shows for KOLN in Lincoln, KSNB in Hastings, KNOP in North Platte, and KNEP in Scottsbluff. In the summer of 2022, Bill became the station's first Digital News Executive Producer,  helping producing content for 10/11's streaming platforms.\n\nWhen Bill isn't at work or chasing storms, he's usually at home causing trouble with Liam and Jamie and their two dogs, Snickers and Rory. When he can, he hits the golf course with Chief Meteorologist Ken Siemek!\n\nWatch our newscasts live on 1011now.com and our 10/11 NOW app on Roku, AppleTV and FireTV.","slug":"","instagram":"wxrentschler","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"26","custom_gray_stationname":"koln","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-08-28T20:51:20.049Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:00:00Z","description":{"basic":"Scattered thunderstorm chances are expected over the next several days."},"headlines":{"basic":"Friday Forecast: Scattered showers with cloudy, cool conditions to finish the work week","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/ZiEMsniJ6PZkv7NQGi33zmHi46Y=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA.gif","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/gif","originalName":"BillStateSkycast-GRAF4km-ezgif.com-speed.gif","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA.gif","owner":"bill.rentschler@1011now.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/ZiEMsniJ6PZkv7NQGi33zmHi46Y=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA.gif","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/ZiEMsniJ6PZkv7NQGi33zmHi46Y=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA.gif","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/aNukrvOchq7rfgICOenRUD6DoMU=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/I6MGMOV7TBEJLLP6QLS35CUQSA.gif","usage_instructions":"None","version":0,"template_id":29},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"378e4b5f065322f9f6ad965261bdb742cd82582eb98d387d0c9ad7b928470061"},"caption":"Mostly cloudy skies with scattered areas of light rain, with isolated thunderstorms, are expected for Friday.","created_date":"2024-05-30T20:04:45Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"KOLN","type":"author"}]},"distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"df7eb693-e238-4261-a264-c7a4edf606e5"},"height":338,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T20:04:45Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"name":"All Gray TV Stations (English and Spanish)","source_type":"staff","additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"KOLN -

You can now see his weather forecasts weekdays on First at Four and Fridays at 5, 6 and 10pm. He earned his American Meteorological Society Certified Broadcast Meteorologist seal in 2008.\n\nFrom an early age, Brandon has been fascinated with weather. After receiving his meteorology degree at North Carolina State, Brandon began his broadcast meteorology career at KRBC in Abilene, Texas in 2003. He started as the weekend meteorologist. During his time there he was promoted to morning meteorologist and eventually chief meteorologist before moving to Lincoln. While there have been numerous forecasts, severe weather events and winter weather events in his career so far, the most memorable was the tornado in Southwest Lincoln in 2019. \n\nWhen not working on or delivering a weather forecast, you can usually find Brandon watching a movie, at a rock concert or hanging out with friends. He also enjoys watching and going to see several sports including basketball, football, baseball, hockey and auto racing.

Koeller is a meteorologist for 6 News WOWT, bringing you weather updates in several afternoon and evening newscasts as well as any time severe weather threatens.\n\nWeather has been David's passion from age 5 when he witnessed a tornado touch down not far from his home in Colorado Springs. Since then, he has been fascinated with forecasting, weather patterns, extreme weather and understanding why it all happens.\n\nDavid didn't always want to be on TV. As a high school student, he wanted to work for the National Weather Service. In college, he realized he liked to talk about the weather too much, and the best way to use that was to move on to TV. He said he never gets tired of people asking about the forecast.\n\nAfter living in Colorado, David grew up in Kansas City, Kansas and graduated from Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. He attended St. Louis University beginning in 2008 where he ran the student television station and served as their meteorologist. While at SLU, David interned at Fox 2 and then KMBC 9 in Kansas City. He graduated in May of 2012 and moved to Springfield, Missouri a few months later to serve as the Chief Meteorologist for FOX 5 until September of 2018.\n\nIn his spare time, David enjoys biking and running, spending time outdoors and swimming as well as some occasionally binge watching Netflix or Amazon.\n\nDavid said the weather in Omaha has already proven to be very exciting, and he is looking forward to bringing the forecast to everyone in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wowt","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2023-08-09T20:05:59.300Z","type":"author","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T01:32:08.418Z","description":{"basic":"After

Jake studied theatre and stage/screenwriting between UNK and UNO before news, earning a bachelor and master of fine arts degrees. His passions for storytelling and the Midwest later landed him in Nebraska journalism.\n \nJake loves a good story and spent much of his master’s program interviewing the homeless in Kearney. Their harrowing and poignant stories revealed the necessity of local storytelling, and Jake has been working to amplify local voices ever since.\n \nHe has passed through several newsrooms across the state, tackling direction and production positions while always having the time to write up a neat article. Reporters and anchors often catch Jake sorting through eye-popping court documents or some goofy story that came across the assignment desk.\n \nWhen he’s not highlighting affidavits, you can find Jake watching the latest films at any of Lincoln’s theaters. He’ll also venture out into some cozy nearby camping spots in the warmer months to pitch a tent, read a book, and set a fire. Jake also enjoys time at home with his cats Beau and Lenny.\n \nJake lives to chat with people about what really matters to them, and he’s almost always waiting by the phone at 10/11. You can give him a call at the newsroom’s number, 402-467-4970.\nYou can also tell Jake about your tales via email at jacob.lawson@1011now.com.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"27","custom_gray_stationname":"koln","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-04-11T16:29:48.546Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T22:44:56.912Z","description":{"basic":"A child from Hickman had to be life-flighted to Omaha after a crash just east of Eagle."},"headlines":{"basic":"Hickman girl life-flighted after two-vehicle crash east of Eagle","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":["car crash","car accident"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"car crash generic.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","owner":"kali.orourke@gray.tv","proxyUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/ciudo4okTssA4eVsOW9FoMv2ywM=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/rizv-ulqnZRoLIs8ozaOlu6t-a4=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/S6SL76JKDJCOLCDMEAZA5VUCCU.jpg","usage_instructions":"Cleared for use","version":0,"template_id":35},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"c064a8c7e60b1f5f19091343361201387d098f269c9b22230024493fed1e0c4f"},"caption":"A child from Hickman had to be life-flighted to Omaha after a crash just east of Eagle.","copyright":"Copyright 2023 MGN.
