She joined Arizona’s Family in January 2020.  ​\n\nBefore making a cross-country move to Arizona, Susan held the same title at WPRI in Providence, Rhode Island, recovering hundreds of thousands of dollars for consumers. During her time in the Ocean State, she also covered several high-profile stories for the station, including the Aaron Hernandez murder trial and the capture of Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Her series of reports on the failed launch of Rhode Island’s $364 million benefits eligibility computer system prompted special legislative hearings and led to the resignations of several senior administrators.\n\nSusan landed her first job in television news as a reporter and producer at WKTV in Utica, New York. She also worked at WFMJ in Youngstown, Ohio.  \n\nSusan graduated cum laude from Syracuse University with bachelor’s degrees in broadcast journalism, political science and Spanish. As part of her undergraduate studies, she spent a semester abroad in Madrid, Spain.\n\nSusan and her husband, Steve, have two children. Whenever they have a free moment together, they enjoy playing golf at the Valley’s beautiful courses.

Still a junior in high school, he started there in 1989 as a tape operator for KYEL-TV. While the age of \"tape\" is long over, Gibby has evolved with the times. He became a photographer for KYEL and then moved to KOLD in Tucson after graduating from Yuma High School.\n\nHe moved to Phoenix to join 3TV as a photojournalist in 1994 -- he had just turned 21 -- and became an integral part of the station's flagship show, \"Good Morning Arizona.\" He's seen Arizona's Family through nearly three decades of growth and transformation, including the merger with CBS 5.\n\nWhile he's still working behind the camera, he's also in front of it just as much now as an on-air reporter for \"Good Morning Arizona\" on 3TV and CBS 5. Gibby covers everything from the day's breaking news to the fun, light-hearted features Arizona's Family loves to see.\n\n\"My mom said, 'If you love what you do, then you'll never work a day in your life.' I have not worked a day in my life,\" Gibby said on his 25th anniversary with Arizona's

Holly graduated from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. Go, Devils!\n\nBefore returning to the Valley of the Sun, Holly worked in El Paso, Texas, for three years as a one-man band multimedia journalist, weekend weather forecaster, and fill-in anchor.\n\nWhile in El Paso, Holly covered a wide range of stories. Some of her most memorable coverage includes the Aug. 3 Walmart mass shooting and presidential visits, including Vice President Kamala Harris’ first official visit to the southern border, alongside many stories regarding the border immigration crisis. In addition, Holly did an exclusive ride-along with the Border Patrol as thousands of migrants crossed into the United States from Mexico daily.\n\nHolly grew up in Los Angeles and loves the ocean more than anything. She is a big fan of country music and plans to attend ​all the concerts she can in Phoenix.\n\nHolly is looking forward to getting to know the community and helping them have a voice.\n\nWhen she’s not working, she’s enjoying the outdoors, at a country music concert or a sporting event (Go, Dodgers!). She also loves wakeboarding and snowboarding.\n\nHolly’s family is now split between Los Angeles, Lake Havasu City, and Flagstaff so being happy to be back in Arizona is an understatement.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kpho","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2024-05-28T02:50:35.860Z","role":"Reporter
