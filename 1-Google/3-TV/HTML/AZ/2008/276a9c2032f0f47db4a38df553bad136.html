The Emmy award-winning reporter is excited to explore the Valley! \n\nMicaela is an Ohio native and most recently worked as a reporter/fill-in anchor in Cleveland. During her three years at Spectrum News 1 Ohio, Micaela earned 5 Emmy nominations, won several Society of Professional Journalists awards, and an AP award. Micaela enjoys health/medical reporting, human interest storytelling as well as investigative journalism. \n\nWhile at Spectrum News, she worked on multiple in-depth series that included an exclusive interview with a man on death row whose case inspired state legislators to work to change the law, a deep dive into policing in Cleveland and Cincinnati, and an exclusive interview with a wrongfully convicted teen who was released from prison after a prosecutor fought to prove his innocence. Her reporting also took her to Paulsboro, New Jersey where a train carrying vinyl chloride derailed in 2012. Her stories there explored the lessons that can be learned from a community that’s dealt with toxic train derailments following the major wreck and chemical spill in East Palestine, Ohio, in February 2023.\n\nBefore moving to Cleveland, she became the first Multimedia Journalist at WTVG 13abc in her hometown of Toledo, Ohio. While there, she filled in on the anchor desk and earned an Emmy in the “Breaking News” category for her live reporting at the scene of a shooting at a high school Homecoming football game.\n\nMicaela is a proud Ohio University E.W. Scripps School of Journalism graduate and served as the captain of the Ohio University Dance Team her senior year.\nWhile in college, she gained experience working as an anchor and reporter at the student-run TV station WOUB. After her freshman year of college, she interned at WTVG 13abc in Toledo, Ohio. She then went on to intern in New York City at the TODAY Show and CBS News in the Investigative Unit. While at CBS News, Micaela’s team won a contest among 50 interns. She served as the correspondent for her group’s news story that was selected as the winner by top CBS News executives and aired on CBSN.\n\nMicaela believes working in local news is a privilege and she’s honored to continue her career in Phoenix. When not on the job, Micaela loves to travel, eat ice cream, and spend time with friends and

Most of her airtime has been spent right here in the Valley of the Sun.\n\nShe started on her career path in the '90s as a college intern and eventual radio news reporter for one of Atlanta’s hottest radio stations located inside the CNN Center in Atlanta. It was there that she landed a wonderful gig and was heard by millions of listeners on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show.\n\nGibson's coast-to-coast career has given her the skill of versatility as a high-energy personality on Arizona's Family. Her passion is telling great stories, getting out and about to meet and talk to people in the community, and making what she calls \"that comfortable connection\" with her viewers.\n\nGibson is a proud resident of the Valley and mom to her two

She joined Arizona’s Family in January 2020.  ​\n\nBefore making a cross-country move to Arizona, Susan held the same title at WPRI in Providence, Rhode Island, recovering hundreds of thousands of dollars for consumers. During her time in the Ocean State, she also covered several high-profile stories for the station, including the Aaron Hernandez murder trial and the capture of Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Her series of reports on the failed launch of Rhode Island’s $364 million benefits eligibility computer system prompted special legislative hearings and led to the resignations of several senior administrators.\n\nSusan landed her first job in television news as a reporter and producer at WKTV in Utica, New York. She also worked at WFMJ in Youngstown, Ohio.  \n\nSusan graduated cum laude from Syracuse University with bachelor’s degrees in broadcast journalism, political science and Spanish. As part of her undergraduate studies, she spent a semester abroad in Madrid, Spain.\n\nSusan and her husband, Steve, have two children.

Still a junior in high school, he started there in 1989 as a tape operator for KYEL-TV. While the age of \"tape\" is long over, Gibby has evolved with the times. He became a photographer for KYEL and then moved to KOLD in Tucson after graduating from Yuma High School.\n\nHe moved to Phoenix to join 3TV as a photojournalist in 1994 -- he had just turned 21 -- and became an integral part of the station's flagship show, \"Good Morning Arizona.\" He's seen Arizona's Family through nearly three decades of growth and transformation, including the merger with CBS 5.\n\nWhile he's still working behind the camera, he's also in front of it just as much now as an on-air reporter for \"Good Morning Arizona\" on 3TV and CBS 5. Gibby covers everything from the day's breaking news to the fun, light-hearted features Arizona's Family loves to see.\n\n\"My mom said, 'If you love what you do, then you'll never work a day in your life.' I have not worked a day in my life,\" Gibby said on his 25th anniversary with Arizona's
