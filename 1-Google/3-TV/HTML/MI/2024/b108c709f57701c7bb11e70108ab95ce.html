His passion for meteorology and forecasting only grew deeper in time, leading to occasional \"vacations\" to go storm-chasing out in the Great Plains. Noel has yet to forecast truly dynamic winter weather and looks forward to this opportunity in the U.P. Absolutely, positively relishes the opportunity -- and he'll get so much more than he ever imagined.\n\nIn his spare time, Noel enjoys playing the drums, hockey, volleyball, hiking, cross-country road trips and trying out all the pizza places in town. He'll likely hold off on another vacation out to Tornado Alley for a long while.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wluc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"2","last_updated_date":"2022-08-24T18:06:07.686Z","type":"author","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/noel.navarroWX","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelnavarro/"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T21:48:44.658Z","description":{"basic":"Warm stretch to begin June but rain, thunderstorms enter the picture for U.P. counties west starting Friday."},"headlines":{"basic":"Warm end to May, warm start to June -- but rain, storms return","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/0olfezKkdnK1T9RTTUnB6P_JWPY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Capture.JPG","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","owner":"nnavarro@wluctv6.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/0olfezKkdnK1T9RTTUnB6P_JWPY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/0olfezKkdnK1T9RTTUnB6P_JWPY=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/Jh5viBwo957GtJIto7pb0QCvlhE=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","usage_instructions":"None","version":0,"template_id":34},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"10df88d826f085fa108ac2a29b665d20713f64d2ba56c27b6e22e4bfce9c96d4"},"caption":"Warm stretch to begin June but rain, thunderstorms enter the picture for U.P. counties west starting Friday.","created_date":"2024-05-30T21:48:36Z","credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Noel Navarro","type":"author"}],"by":[{"byline":"Maxuser","name":"Maxuser","type":"author"}]},"height":476,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T21:48:36Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray","sponsored":false},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Warm end to May, warm start to June -- but rain, storms return","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/FCLKWZ5BR5FCJJX73DYV33DVZY.JPG","version":"0.10.9","width":859,"syndication":{},"creditIPTC":"Noel Navarro"},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wluc":{"website_section":{"path":"/news","_website":"wluc","name":"News","_id":"/news","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/30/warm-end-may-warm-start-june-rain-storms-return/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wluc","websites":{"wluc":{"website_section":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wluc","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wluc","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1041},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wluc./weather/forecast"},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/warm-end-may-warm-start-june-rain-storms-return/"}},"_id":"Z4JL4WGFOZGBVA4GTUT4ELG4RY","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wluc","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wluc","name":"Forecast","site":{"site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Forecast"},"node_type":"section","order":{"default":2002,"publishing-sections":1041},"ancestors":{"default":["/","/weather"],"publishing-sections":["/"]},"parent":{"default":"/weather","publishing-sections":"/"},"_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast"},"inactive":false}},"_website_section_id":"wluc./weather/forecast"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/30/warm-end-may-warm-start-june-rain-storms-return/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/30/marquette-county-election-commission-conduct-hearing-recall-language-filed-against-maps-board-members/","content_elements":[{"_id":"6U4IFKAGZRC3BFEF6VY4GW7F6M","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":"7XHSETOKWRFCFK55SU5NGO4GW4","comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"MARQUETTE COUNTY, Mich.

She received the MAB Best In Weather award  in 2018, 2019 and 2021.\n\nShe returned to the Upper Peninsula in 2018 after spending some time in tornado alley as a weekend meteorologist for the KSPR Weather Team in Springfield, Missouri. Hint-she loves severe weather. Jennifer was born in Puerto Rico but raised in sunny Florida. Growing up in Florida she loved watching thunderstorms in the summer. After touring the weather department at WJXT, her local news station in Jacksonville, Florida, she realized her future was in Meteorology.\n\nIn 2011, she graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Arts in broadcast journalism and a minor in theater.\nJennifer started her career on the shores of Lake Superior in 2012 at WLUC-TV6 in Marquette, Michigan as a news reporter. During her time as a reporter and fill-in anchor here she traveled across the entire U.P. to cover stories including the 2012 elections and the evolution of Duke LifePoint with U.P. Health System. In 2015, her mini-series on medical marijuana won an award from the Michigan Association of Broadcasters. During this, she worked towards a degree in meteorology.\n\nAfter three years of reporting, she started her weather career as a forecaster at WILX News 10 in Lansing, Michigan. She then graduated in May of 2016 from Mississippi State University with a Bachelor of Science in broadcast meteorology. To continue her education she earned the National Weather Association Seal of Approval in November of 2020.\n\nJennifer enjoys hiking, exploring, spending time on the lake, and attending plays. Jennifer is excited to be back on the shores of Lake Superior. Interesting tidbits: she’s fluent in Spanish, a huge Disney fanatic, and loves chicken wings (all the chicken wings)!!
