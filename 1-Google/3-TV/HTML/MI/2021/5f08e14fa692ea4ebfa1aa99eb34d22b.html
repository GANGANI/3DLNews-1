He rejoined the TV6 team in January 2017.\n\nBorn and raised in Marquette, Andrew grew up watching TV6. Andrew’s aunt worked at the station and would bring him to visit and meet the news team. This helped ignite Andrew’s passion for television news.\n\nAs a youth, Andrew participated in 8-18 Media, a program of the Upper Peninsula Children’s Museum.

Andrew is still active in the Children’s Museum as a member of its board of directors.\n\nAndrew graduated from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Music degree in cello performance and a minor in government.\n\nAndrew was a reporter and producer for the TV6 Morning News from May 2012 until Aug. 2013. He then became a political and investigative reporter at FOX 11 News in Green Bay, Wisconsin. At FOX 11, Andrew covered Wisconsin politics and elections. In the 2016 election cycle, he interviewed Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Tim Kaine, Bernie Sanders and many other candidates.\n\nAndrew decided to return to Upper Michigan for many reasons, including opportunities with music and snow! Andrew is a member of the Marquette Symphony Orchestra and teaches music lessons. He also enjoys downhill skiing, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nAndrew is a fan of the Green Bay Packers, Detroit Tigers and Michigan Wolverines.

She rejoined the TV6 News team in August 2020.\n\nOriginally from the downstate Grand Rapids area, Elizabeth has lived in the Upper Peninsula for more than 18 years. Elizabeth grew up in the television industry.  Her grandmother, mother and aunt all held various positions at television stations across the country. Watching them, listening to their stories and spending so much time behind the scenes lead her to pursue a career in broadcast journalism.\n\nA proud Spartan, Elizabeth graduated from Michigan State University. Go Green!\n\nElizabeth was a reporter and anchor for the TV6 Early News and News Tonight from 2005 until 2009. She also worked for a time as a morning producer and as the first producer and anchor for FOX UP News.

However, Cody is a proud Michigander, born and raised in the Lower Peninsula in Gladwin County and a 2014 graduate of Northern Michigan University.\n \nCody was the senior reporter and evening anchor at KBZK / KXLF in Bozeman, Montana’s News Leader. For nearly three years, he sat alongside journalism greats like Donna Kelley and Chet Layman at the anchor desk while also leading the helm in the field, covering a wide arrange of topics and accruing several top awards, including two E.B. Craney Awards for breaking and hard news coverage and being voted “Bozeman’s Best Anchor” alongside Donna and Chet in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, he also joined the list of journalists in the historical coverage of Ted Kaczinski, also known as “The Unabomber,” being the first reporter to interview Ed Sprout, the semi-truck driver who avoided 25-plus years of cameras after hauling the Unabomber’s cabin from Montana to California. Cody frequently donned wildland fire gear and orange vests in the Bozeman area, covering wildland fires that expanded to tens of thousands of acres of Montanan prairie and mountain landscape, including the Bridger Foothills Fire, which destroyed around 70 homes in early-September 2020. He was also recently awarded \"Bozeman's Best News Writer of 2022\" prior to his return to Upper Michigan in November 2021. While in Montana, Cody also volunteered as an exotic animal rehabilitator, rescuing reptiles and other \"unusual pets\" from poorly-maintained circumstances. He also frequented the backcountry trails of Yellowstone National Park. \n \nPrior to KBZK, Cody worked as a reporter and anchor at 9&10 News in Cadillac, MI, covering several counties and telling hundreds of stories across Michigan’s Northern Lower Peninsula. There, he was recognized with several Michigan Association of Broadcaster accolades for his coverage and attention to community life and events. One moment that he is proud of: meeting and interviewing \"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky following the death of hockey legend Gordie Howe. Cody followed the Presidential Election of 2016 closely, interviewing many of the candidates and attending dozens of presidential rallies. He also was among the team to report on-the-ground during the peak of the Flint Water Crisis, covering the impact in both the communities across Genesee County and animal shelters found to also be battling lead-contaminated water. In record, he is the first reporter to have been able to venture into and cover \"from the inside\" a Rainbow Family Gathering in Manistee County in 2015, traveling by way of potato truck deep into the Manistee National Forest in Wexford County. \n \nBack at NMU, Cody was swayed into journalism through the amazing opportunities at WNMU TV13’s “Public Eye News” and The North Wind campus newspaper, where he worked as an anchor/producer/director at PEN and, at The North Wind, the sports editor before becoming the editor-in-chief in 2014. He also produced and jockeyed a radio show on NMU's \"Radio X.\"\n \nAll of that aside, Cody was brought back to Northern Michigan for a primary reason: it’s home. Cody loves everything to do with U.P., from hiking and fishing to remembering jumping off of Black Rocks during his university years. He’s trading the Bridger Mountains of Gallatin County for Sugarloaf and Hogsback, knowing that while they may not be as tall that no other landscape in the world has Lake Superior as a backdrop. \n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wluc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-03-11T19:08:04.807Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":7,"website_url":"/authors/CodyBoyer/","headlines":{"basic":"Cody Boyer"},"description":{"basic":"Cody joined the TV6 team in November 2021."},"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"CBoyer@wluctv6.com"}],"type":"author","custom_gray_biovideouuid":"","hasVideoCenterVideo":false,"promo_items":{"basic":{"type":"image","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/25d88d14-5a16-4cd7-a888-1735d225b434.png","auth":{"3":"8dd837b1a559fea3a896062f9329759381cab1d2fadee7356c70188000ce6392"}}},"dataTransformedAt":"2024-05-31T05:05:55.508Z"},{"_id":"a_stetson","firstName":"Audrey","lastName":"Stetson","byline":"Audrey Stetson","role":"TV6 Multimedia Journalist (MMJ)","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/gray/2cf47c10-c21f-4400-a9be-e512d1a21990.png","email":"","affiliations":"","education":[],"awards":[],"books":[],"podcasts":[],"bio_page":"/authors/a_stetson/","bio":"Audrey joined the TV6 team August 2023","longBio":"Born and raised in the Upper Peninsula, Audrey Stetson is happy to be part of the TV6 News Team.\n\nAudrey grew up in Ishpeming, eating at the Congress with her family and doing nothing with her friends in parked cars.

There she hosted a weekly segment, “I Love the Arklatex,” where she went hunting for the Boggy Creek Monster and searched for the quirkiest and yummiest things the Arklatex had to offer.\n\nAnnie is an animal lover and embraces being a “crazy cat lady.” She can often be spotted walking her cat on the National Mall. Annie is also an avid football fan and never misses watching her San Diego State Aztecs play, even if that means streaming the game over the computer and staying up all hours of the night.\n\nDuring the summer, you can spot her out sailing on the Potomac or Anacostia rivers. She tries to go out every weekend to soak in all the summertime sun.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"gray-dc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-07-26T18:41:38.522Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":10,"website_url":"/authors/AnnieAndersen/","headlines":{"basic":"Annie Andersen"},"description":{"basic":"Annie has worked at various news outlets in Washington, D.C., including covering the 2020 and 2022 election cycles for C-SPAN.
