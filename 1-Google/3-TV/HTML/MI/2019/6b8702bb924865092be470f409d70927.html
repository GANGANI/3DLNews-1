But it was also a holiday weekend, and if you were a senior, your classes were over. Graduates as well as current students, some from Lansing schools and some from other districts, were gathered together to celebrate the end of the school year for some and a three-day weekend for all.

And our students are doing better than they have in years. Please do not judge our students because they wanted to enjoy themselves on a three-day weekend. We should judge the assailants who drove up and started shooting. We should figure out who those people are and we should deal with them accordingly. But just because students were out late does not mean they are bad or up to no good. When I was in high school, I, too, would stay out late with friends, especially during a three-day weekend. We would go to IHOP or just drive around. Sometimes, we would go to the beach and watch the stars. But the point is that teenagers sometimes have parties and sometimes stay out late. I appreciate that our first reaction might be to act tough and make even more rules against kids and everyone else.

Marz is a Heart Journalism award winner placing number 16th nationally in what is considered the “Pulitzer Prize of Collegiate Journalism.”\n\nWhile at Kent State, Marz worked closely with the Kent State Student Media as a multimedia journalist/reporter shooting, writing, and editing his stories for TV2 News. He served as a weather and segment anchor and a newscast producer. He also interned with WKYC 3 News in Cleveland, OH. \nAdditionally, Marz worked as a radio jockey, marketing, and web director, later becoming the general manager of the student-run radio station Black Squirrel Radio. Following graduation Marz had a brief stint at WETM 18 News in Elmira, NY, and then Ideastream Public Media in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe Cleveland native loves all things music and entertainment but has experience in all forms of storytelling. Marz enjoys graphic design, marketing, and social media content creation. Reality TV is his guilty pleasure when he isn’t sharing the realities of the world on News 10. He plans to show his flare while telling stories in the Mid-Michigan.
