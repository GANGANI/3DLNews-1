The Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation has reflected the passion its founders had for the organization and its mission during their lifetimes by granting a $7.5 million challenge to the organization as a 1:1 philanthropic match.\r\nThe Foundation’s commitment honors the legacy of Fred and Barbara Erb, their lifelong love of and commitment to Detroit PBS and 90.9 WRCJ, and shared values of sustainability, servant leadership and collaboration toward a just and civil society. Detroit PBS expects this exceptional gift will motivate others committed to philanthropy, from its audience, other foundations and the corporate community, to match the Foundation’s generosity over the next 36 months to help fund the new community media campus.\r\nIn April, the organization purchased the property at 234 Piquette Avenue, in the Milwaukee Junction neighborhood, between John R and Brush Streets, where it will renovate and expand an existing building to serve as much more than a traditional television station.

The PBS Books Readers Club is featuring some of the season’s hottest, fresh fiction from four contemporary and sought-after authors: Rachel Khong, Olivia Ford, Percival Everett and Tana French. These page turners check every box, ranging in category from philosophical and emotive to heartwarming and redemptive to adventurous and darkly humorous to suspenseful and alluring.\r\n“To me, a great summer read is a book you get lost in while you’re reading it, and you can’t wait to talk about when you’re done!” says Lauren Smith, co-host and executive producer of the PBS Books Readers Club. “The books selected vary widely across genres and are replete with riveting storylines and memorable characters — they’re each a must-read, perfect for those lazy summer days.”\r\nBeginning this month, PBS Books Readers Club will feature one of these authors in its monthly digital video series.\r\n“Real Americans,” by Rachel Khong, Wednesday, May 29 @ 8 p.m.\r\nIn honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, PBS Books Readers Club dives into this highly anticipated novel from award-winning Rachel Khong, author of “Goodbye, Vitamin.”  Khong discusses this sweeping family drama that tells the story of three generations of Chinese Americans, raising questions about identity, what it means to be real Americans and wrestles with issues of class, race and genetics.\r\nThe novel is narrated by three members of the same family: May, the Chinese-born matriarch; her American daughter, Lily; and Lily’s biracial son, Nick. The novel begins in 1999 in New York City, when 22-year-old Lily Chen, an unpaid intern at a slick media company, meets Matthew, heir to a pharmaceutical empire. Matthew is everything Lily is not yet despite all this, Lily and Matthew fall in love and eventually have a child, Nick.\r\nFast forward to 2021, Nick has never felt like he belonged on the isolated Washington island where he lives with his single mother, Lily. He can’t shake the sense she’s hiding something. When Nick sets out to find his biological father, the journey threatens to raise more questions than it provides answers.\r\n“Mrs. Quinn’s Rise to Fame,” by Olivia Ford, Wednesday, June 27 @ 8 p.m.\r\nLauded by The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR, this debut novel by Olivia Ford is a delightful, coming-of-old-age tale. Jenny Quinn, a 77-year-old homemaker has lived a quiet life with her husband of nearly 60 years. But as she ages, she aches for more meaning, so she applies and wins a spot on the popular British show, “Britain Bakes.”\r\nJenny delights in a new-found independence. But that independence, and the stress of the competition, starts to unearth memories and a secret buried decades ago. With her baking star rising, Jenny struggles to keep a lid on that first secret—a long-concealed deceit that threatens to shatter the very foundations of her marriage. By putting herself in the limelight, has Jenny created a recipe for disaster?

The PBS Books Readers Club is featuring some of the season’s hottest, fresh fiction from four contemporary and sought-after authors: Rachel Khong, Olivia Ford, Percival Everett and Tana French. These page turners check every box, ranging in category from philosophical and emotive to heartwarming and redemptive to adventurous and darkly humorous to suspenseful and alluring.\r\n“To me, a great summer read is a book you get lost in while you’re reading it, and you can’t wait to talk about when you’re done!” says Lauren Smith, co-host and executive producer of the PBS Books Readers Club. “The books selected vary widely across genres and are replete with riveting storylines and memorable characters — they’re each a must-read, perfect for those lazy summer days.”\r\nBeginning this month, PBS Books Readers Club will feature one of these authors in its monthly digital video series.\r\n“Real Americans,” by Rachel Khong, Wednesday, May 29 @ 8 p.m.\r\nIn honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, PBS Books Readers Club dives into this highly anticipated novel from award-winning Rachel Khong, author of “Goodbye, Vitamin.”  Khong discusses this sweeping family drama that tells the story of three generations of Chinese Americans, raising questions about identity, what it means to be real Americans and wrestles with issues of class, race and genetics.\r\nThe novel is narrated by three members of the same family: May, the Chinese-born matriarch; her American daughter, Lily; and Lily’s biracial son, Nick. The novel begins in 1999 in New York City, when 22-year-old Lily Chen, an unpaid intern at a slick media company, meets Matthew, heir to a pharmaceutical empire. Matthew is everything Lily is not yet despite all this, Lily and Matthew fall in love and eventually have a child, Nick.\r\nFast forward to 2021, Nick has never felt like he belonged on the isolated Washington island where he lives with his single mother, Lily. He can’t shake the sense she’s hiding something. When Nick sets out to find his biological father, the journey threatens to raise more questions than it provides answers.\r\n“Mrs. Quinn’s Rise to Fame,” by Olivia Ford, Wednesday, June 27 @ 8 p.m.\r\nLauded by The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR, this debut novel by Olivia Ford is a delightful, coming-of-old-age tale. Jenny Quinn, a 77-year-old homemaker has lived a quiet life with her husband of nearly 60 years. But as she ages, she aches for more meaning, so she applies and wins a spot on the popular British show, “Britain Bakes.”\r\nJenny delights in a new-found independence. But that independence, and the stress of the competition, starts to unearth memories and a secret buried decades ago. With her baking star rising, Jenny struggles to keep a lid on that first secret—a long-concealed deceit that threatens to shatter the very foundations of her marriage. By putting herself in the limelight, has Jenny created a recipe for disaster?

The PBS Books Readers Club is featuring some of the season’s hottest, fresh fiction from four contemporary and sought-after authors: Rachel Khong, Olivia Ford, Percival Everett and Tana French. These page turners check every box, ranging in category from philosophical and emotive to heartwarming and redemptive to adventurous and darkly humorous to suspenseful and alluring.\r\n“To me, a great summer read is a book you get lost in while you’re reading it, and you can’t wait to talk about when you’re done!” says Lauren Smith, co-host and executive producer of the PBS Books Readers Club. “The books selected vary widely across genres and are replete with riveting storylines and memorable characters — they’re each a must-read, perfect for those lazy summer days.”\r\nBeginning this month, PBS Books Readers Club will feature one of these authors in its monthly digital video series.\r\n“Real Americans,” by Rachel Khong, Wednesday, May 29 @ 8 p.m.\r\nIn honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, PBS Books Readers Club dives into this highly anticipated novel from award-winning Rachel Khong, author of “Goodbye, Vitamin.”  Khong discusses this sweeping family drama that tells the story of three generations of Chinese Americans, raising questions about identity, what it means to be real Americans and wrestles with issues of class, race and genetics.\r\nThe novel is narrated by three members of the same family: May, the Chinese-born matriarch; her American daughter, Lily; and Lily’s biracial son, Nick. The novel begins in 1999 in New York City, when 22-year-old Lily Chen, an unpaid intern at a slick media company, meets Matthew, heir to a pharmaceutical empire. Matthew is everything Lily is not yet despite all this, Lily and Matthew fall in love and eventually have a child, Nick.\r\nFast forward to 2021, Nick has never felt like he belonged on the isolated Washington island where he lives with his single mother, Lily. He can’t shake the sense she’s hiding something. When Nick sets out to find his biological father, the journey threatens to raise more questions than it provides answers.\r\n“Mrs. Quinn’s Rise to Fame,” by Olivia Ford, Wednesday, June 27 @ 8 p.m.\r\nLauded by The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR, this debut novel by Olivia Ford is a delightful, coming-of-old-age tale. Jenny Quinn, a 77-year-old homemaker has lived a quiet life with her husband of nearly 60 years. But as she ages, she aches for more meaning, so she applies and wins a spot on the popular British show, “Britain Bakes.”\r\nJenny delights in a new-found independence. But that independence, and the stress of the competition, starts to unearth memories and a secret buried decades ago. With her baking star rising, Jenny struggles to keep a lid on that first secret—a long-concealed deceit that threatens to shatter the very foundations of her marriage. By putting herself in the limelight, has Jenny created a recipe for disaster? PBS viewers who are loyal fans of  “Great American Recipe,” will love this charming read.\r\n“James,” by Percival Everett, Wednesday, July 24 @ 8 p.m.\r\nEnjoy a robust discussion with Pulitzer Prize finalist, Percival Everett about his new release, “James.”  An instant New York Times bestseller, this brilliant, action-packed reimagining of “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” is harrowing, darkly humorous and brimming with scathing observations.  \r\nWhen the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans—to be separated from his wife and child forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father who recently returned to town. Thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond.\r\nFans of PBS’ Passport catalog and Ken Burns’ historical films, including his series on Mark Twain will enjoy this thrilling and soulful novel.\r\n“The Hunter,” by Tana French, Wednesday, Aug. 28 @ 8 p.m. \r\nLastly, New York Times bestselling author Tana French talks with PBS Books Readers Club about her latest novel, “The Hunter,” the sequel to “The Searcher.” In “The Hunter,” French weaves a nuanced tale of loyalty and retribution and what we sacrifice when the two collide.\r\nSet a small village in the West of Ireland, two men enter the town. One of them is coming home. Both of them are coming to get rich. One of them is coming to die.\r\nCal Hooper took early retirement from Chicago PD and moved to rural Ireland looking for peace and has built a relationship with a local woman, Lena and her daughter, Trey.  Once Trey’s absentee father reappears, bringing along an English millionaire and a scheme to find gold in the townland, suddenly everything the three of them have been building is under threat. Cal and Lena are both ready to do whatever it takes to protect Trey, but Trey doesn’t want protecting, she wants revenge.\r\nFans of PBS’ “Grantchester” and “Hotel Portofino” will love this tense and immersive read.\r\nPBS Books Readers Club by the Numbers\r\nSince its inception in January 2024, the PBS Books Readers Club has experienced explosive growth. Currently the PBS Books Readers Club Facebook group has more than 100,000 members and has generated 1.2-million-episode views and nearly 2.8 million views in total with social media promotional posts included. Its audience engagement has generated more than 250,000+ likes, loves, shares, comments.\r\n“It’s been so much fun to see the lively interaction between readers in the PBS Books Readers Club Facebook group and during our monthly events, and talking to authors about their writing process and inspiration always makes us appreciate their books even more!” said Smith.  \r\nThe PBS Books Readers Club was launched as an initiative between PBS Books, Detroit PBS and PBS as a national online hub for avid readers who enjoy public television.\r\nHere are a few recent comments from our readers:\r\nThanks PBS Books! That was amazing! I’m really enjoying this book!\r\nThis interview has expanded my love for this book. Thank you!

The campus will provide an ideally situated home for an organizational headquarters, video production and broadcasts, 90.9 WRCJ radio production and broadcasts, arts performances, journalism hub and community events space.\r\nDetroit PBS's new building will uniquely combine features from leading public media facilities in Boston, Denver and Austin, showcasing innovation by integrating them all under one roof.\r\n“Our return to Detroit represents the culmination of more than a decade of commitment to Detroit, which we believe is The Most Important City in America,” said Rich Homberg, Detroit PBS’s President and CEO. “We have been a leader in community engagement in the PBS system, and that is one of the reasons we have the most diverse viewership in the PBS system. The focus of our content and engagement starts in the city and then extends outward to the far reaches of Southeast Michigan, becoming a unifying force in the region.”\r\nDetroit PBS expects to begin construction later this year, with an opening scheduled for Fall 2026. This announcement comes nearly 20 years after the organization announced a headquarters move to Wixom, driven by a federal mandate at the time to cost-efficiently convert to digital television broadcasting.

IMLS will continue to seek and present our local stories through museums, libraries, and their local communities, showing the truly rich diversity of the American story, told in the individual voices masking up the harmonic chorus of our community life,” said IMLS Director Crosby Kemper. “Civil discourse is greatly needed today, and our most trusted civic and cultural institutions must play the central role in its restoration. We hope to inspire viewers and patrons to awaken to the power and joy of their local history and the part it plays in our national story and the shared ideals of our country.”\r\n“Visions of America” will kick off in June with three virtual conversations hosted by PBS Books with Kemper and his invited guests. Topics for discussion include:\r\n\r\n\tJune: The significance of the America250 project and the important role of IMLS as it supports museums and libraries to explore the America250 themes in their communities.\r\n\tJuly: The durability of the U.S. Constitution and how the America250’s “We the People” theme can initiate conversations about the Constitution’s relevance in a changing world.\r\n\tAugust: Drawing on the America250 theme “Unfinished Revolutions,” the conversation will mark the 75th anniversary of the desegregation of the military and its impact on civil rights and the definition of citizenship.\r\n\r\nBeginning in fall 2023, Kemper will lead a video tour through three lesser-known historical sites that symbolize an aspect of the spirit of our independence. Some of our nation’s most notable historians and authors will share the tales and themes that reverberate inside the walls of these institutions. Each episode will include exploring the cities these institutions call home to probe what makes each of these communities so important to our national identity.\r\nAt the core of the project will be community outreach through museums and libraries to engage diverse audiences and foster civic discourse. PBS Books will provide free resources and offer webinars to support museum and library staff designing programs, including integrating the video content to host screening events and community conversations around the series themes.\r\nIn collaboration with IMLS and PBS Books, Detroit PBS will serve as a media partner and producer of the new series. “PBS Books is delighted to share these important conversations not only with museums, libraries, historical sites, and their patrons – but with audiences across the country,” said Rich Homberg, president, and CEO of Detroit PBS. “We’re proud to be a part of the America250 period of reflection and celebration and count this project as one of many we can pursue together.”\r\nThe conversations will be distributed through social media platforms including Facebook and YouTube and posted for on-demand use by museums, libraries, and the IMLS for further engagement and dissemination.\r\nExamples of the places, people, and stories that could be covered during the tour include:\r\n\r\n\tThe Freedom Tower (or Torre de la Libertad) in Miami has graced the city’s skyline for nearly a century, but it wasn’t until it played a crucial role in hosting Cuban refugees who fled their home country in the wake of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 that it became an important national landmark.\r\n\tThe Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded in 1990 to keep the stories of its players and how they eventually broke the barriers of segregation in Major League Baseball alive, especially Jackie Robinson, who played for the Kansas City Monarchs before his courageous move to the MLB. While the conversation will start with baseball, the museum also shares its building with the American Jazz Museum and is located in the famed 18th \u0026amp; Vine District.\r\n\tThe Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience was established in Seattle in 1967 as the only Pan-Asian Pacific American community-based museum in the country. The episode will feature a discussion of the resilience of Asian American immigrants, from their early oppression in the United States to a now flourishing community in Seattle’s Chinatown-International District.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the programs themselves, Detroit PBS and PBS Books plan to distribute the “Visions of America” series to interested PBS stations as well as through the PBS app. Classroom resources will be developed to be used by teachers across the country.\r\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services \r\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation's libraries and museums. We advance, support, and empower America's museums, libraries, and related organizations through grantmaking, research, and policy development. IMLS envisions a nation where individuals and communities have access to museums and libraries to learn from and be inspired by the trusted information, ideas, and stories they contain about our diverse natural and cultural heritage.

While the conversation will start with baseball, the museum also shares its building with the American Jazz Museum and is located in the famed 18th \u0026amp; Vine District.\r\n\tThe Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience was established in Seattle in 1967 as the only Pan-Asian Pacific American community-based museum in the country. The episode will feature a discussion of the resilience of Asian American immigrants, from their early oppression in the United States to a now flourishing community in Seattle’s Chinatown-International District.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the programs themselves, Detroit PBS and PBS Books plan to distribute the “Visions of America” series to interested PBS stations as well as through the PBS app. Classroom resources will be developed to be used by teachers across the country.\r\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services \r\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation's libraries and museums.
