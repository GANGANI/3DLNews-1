Kendall made the move to KEYC News Now in March of 2024 and enjoys showcasing the communities that make up Minnesota.\n\nHometown?\n\nI call Mankato, Minnesota my hometown since I’ve lived there the longest.\n\nAlma Mater?\n\nMy Alma Mater is Minnesota State University, Mankato.\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job?\n\nMy favorite part of my job at KEYC is talking with people and learning their stories.\n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nI would love to tell a deep story about the importance of mass media and how the public is our watchdog as we are theirs.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nWhen I was a kid, I really wanted to be a singer. As I grew up this changed to a dancer, Olympic swimmer, and even movie writer. Nowadays I dream of writing a renowned fantasy series.\n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI owe my interest in news to my time at the MSU Reporter, my campus newspaper. It was my introduction to the news career, and I loved talking to people about their passions.\n\nPick any four from below – Please email me back only the questions you answered. Thank you!\n\nWhat's one thing you cannot live without?\n\nOne thing I couldn’t live without? I could give the logical response of my phone, but honestly, my big, comfy blanket at home has gotten me through some rough days.\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\nMy hobbies are reading and playing video games. My current gaming obsession is Stardew Valley. I also paint when I feel inspired.\n\nWhat's your favorite season?\n\nMy favorite season is fall. I love the cooler weather and I prefer to wear sweaters or cute coats.\n\nIf you could have any superpower, which would you pick?\n\nIf I could have any superpower, it would be super intelligence. I struggle with learning languages beyond the basics, and I figure being super smart might help me learn them. Plus, being a god at math is always fun.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_displaypriority":"8","custom_gray_stationname":"keyc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2024-05-16T18:40:56.263Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T23:15:00Z","description":{"basic":"Adverse

While she has scattered bylines, her most prominent ones can be found in the archives of the Mankato Free Press, the MSU Reporter, and Her Campus Media. \n \nWhen Ashley isn’t in the newsroom, she can be found at local coffee shops, thrift stores, and a cabin up north with her husband, looking for cool rocks on the shore of Lake Superior. \n \nHometown? I'm originally from Minneapolis, MN. \n \nAlma Mater? I graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato in the spring of 2022 with a bachelor's degree in communication studies and political science. Roll Mavs! \n \nWhat's your favorite part of your job? The ability to keep my community informed and connected to one another. \n \nWhat's your dream story? I'll let you know when I come across it one day. \n \nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up? Believe it or not, I've always wanted to be a writer. The stack of notebooks containing stories written by an ambitious nine-year-old me is currently collecting dust somewhere at my parents' house as proof. My backup plan, however, was to be a cowgirl. I read Black Beauty by Anna Sewell as a kid and became obsessed with the idea of riding and raising horses for a living. I totally still would, but don’t tell my boss. I quite enjoy the job I have now. \n \nWhat got you interested in news? I like being the person with random ‘did you know?’ facts, and the news provides ample content for that. \n \nWhat person do you most admire? My patient, gracious, pure-hearted mother. I’ll probably spend my whole life working to be half the woman she is. \n \nWhat's your favorite band? Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles. \n \nWhat's your favorite food? Any traditional Filipino dish that my dad cooks. \n \nWhat are your hobbies? I have a handful that I enjoy, but my favorite is motorcycles. Riding them, fixing them up, learning all about them. I love it all. I’m a huge Harley-Davidson fan, and if anyone would like to gift me a Sportster, I wouldn’t be opposed. I also love collecting American traditional tattoos, much to my mother’s dismay.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"keyc","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"11","last_updated_date":"2024-05-03T14:44:21.482Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T13:10:11.091Z","description":{"basic":"A

She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling. You might see her around!  \n\nHometown? \n\nPrinceton, MN and Leander, TX \n\nAlma Mater?\n\nBethany Lutheran College \n\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job? \n\nTalking to people and being able to tell their unique stories. \n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nAnything that helps people in the community, whether that be a political event, answer to a local crime, or small story showcasing one individual. \n\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA writer. \n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI went to college for film and developed a passion for stories that felt human - also, I just like talking to people!

She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling. You might see her around!  \n\nHometown? \n\nPrinceton, MN and Leander, TX \n\nAlma Mater?\n\nBethany Lutheran College \n\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job? \n\nTalking to people and being able to tell their unique stories. \n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nAnything that helps people in the community, whether that be a political event, answer to a local crime, or small story showcasing one individual. \n\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA writer. \n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI went to college for film and developed a passion for stories that felt human - also, I just like talking to people! Pick any four from below – Please email me back only the questions you answered. Thank you! \n\nWhat's your favorite sport to watch?\n\nHockey. \n\nFavorite Book?\n\n“Vicious” by V. E. Schwab. \n\nWhat are your hobbies? \n\nWatching movies/TV and offering ridiculously in-depth commentary, exercising, listening to music, and going for long drives. \n\nIf you could spend a week anywhere, where would you go?\n\nEither Switzerland or the Appalachian Mountains.

She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling. You might see her around!  \n\nHometown? \n\nPrinceton, MN and Leander, TX \n\nAlma Mater?\n\nBethany Lutheran College \n\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job? \n\nTalking to people and being able to tell their unique stories. \n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nAnything that helps people in the community, whether that be a political event, answer to a local crime, or small story showcasing one individual. \n\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA writer. \n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI went to college for film and developed a passion for stories that felt human - also, I just like talking to people!

She joined the team in January 2024.  \n\nSophia grew up consuming vast amounts of movies, TV shows, and books, and always knew she wanted to tell stories. The form that took shifted – for a long time, she wanted to be a writer; then, she attended Bethany Lutheran College’s Media Arts boot camp and decided she wanted to go to college for film. Additionally, her dad had been a sports reporter for years, and talked constantly about the experience and how much he’d loved it; so there was always an idea in the back of her head that she wanted to be a reporter.\n\n At Bethany Lutheran College, Sophia studied film and broadcast; her main area of involvement was in making short films, some for class, others in her free time, as well as participating in the MSU hockey broadcast. Over her four years there, she was the technical director, managing the video switcher as well as dabbling in camera and replay. However, even though her emphasis was in broadcast, she didn’t stop writing; most notably, she worked as a writer for the Bethany Scroll. Sophia graduated from BLC in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Media Arts. She scored a job with KEYC in the production department in November 2022, which transferred easily into reporting starting in January 2024. \n\nIn her free time, Sophia enjoys spending time with her friends, going to local coffee shops, and traveling. You might see her around!  \n\nHometown? \n\nPrinceton, MN and Leander, TX \n\nAlma Mater?\n\nBethany Lutheran College \n\n\nWhat's your favorite part of your job? \n\nTalking to people and being able to tell their unique stories. \n\nWhat's your dream story?\n\nAnything that helps people in the community, whether that be a political event, answer to a local crime, or small story showcasing one individual. \n\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA writer. \n\nWhat got you interested in (news, sports, weather)?\n\nI went to college for film and developed a passion for stories that felt human - also, I just like talking to people! Pick any four from below – Please email me back only the questions you answered. Thank you! \n\nWhat's your favorite sport to watch?\n\nHockey. \n\nFavorite Book?\n\n“Vicious” by V. E. Schwab. \n\nWhat are your hobbies? \n\nWatching movies/TV and offering ridiculously in-depth commentary, exercising, listening to music, and going for long drives. \n\nIf you could spend a week anywhere, where would you go?\n\nEither Switzerland or the Appalachian Mountains.
