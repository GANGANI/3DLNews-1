When the dastardly villain Hacker (Lloyd) launches a mad mission to conquer the virtual universe, Motherboard calls upon three earth kids for help. They are Jackie, Matt and Inez - the culturally diverse heroes of CYBERCHASE - who, along with the wise-cracking cyber-bird Digit (Gottfried), travel from their real-world realm to the colorful virtual vistas of cyberspace, where they vanquish the bad guys in an all-out battle of wits.

Once a planet or star has been sucked into the black hole, it cannot escape, and compresses to a very small size.","episode_number":124,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ready Jet Go show image\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-320x180.jpg 320w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-640x360.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>","hours":0,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"5:30 PM","end_time":"5:58 PM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKID","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/ready-jet-go\/","start":true},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"6:00 PM","end_time":"7:28 PM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":true},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"6:00 PM","end_time":"7:28 PM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":false},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"6:00 PM","end_time":"7:28 PM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":false},{"program_id":407469,"show_wp_post_id":150370,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 4: Royal Monkey","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 7:30pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 3:30am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 7:30pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Everyone's favorite curious monkey returns for more fun-filled adventures in the all-new animated movie, \"Curious George: Royal Monkey.\" In a case of mistaken identity, George is accidentally swapped with an identical-looking Royal Monkey with a totally different personality.

Once a planet or star has been sucked into the black hole, it cannot escape, and compresses to a very small size.","episode_number":124,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Ready Jet Go show image\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-320x180.jpg 320w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/ready-jet-go-640x360.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>","hours":0,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"1:30 AM","end_time":"1:58 AM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKID","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/ready-jet-go\/","start":true},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"2:00 AM","end_time":"3:28 AM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":true},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"2:00 AM","end_time":"3:28 AM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":false},{"program_id":278065,"show_wp_post_id":32321,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 6pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 2am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 6pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Curious George goes on an epic adventure to space that crash lands in the jungles of Africa leading to an unforgettable journey with some new animal friends.","episode_number":0,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/themes\/tpt\/dist\/images\/default-post-image-1024.jpg\" alt=\"Default image\"\/>","hours":1,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"2:00 AM","end_time":"3:28 AM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKDS","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"","start":false},{"program_id":407469,"show_wp_post_id":150370,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George 4: Royal Monkey","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 7:30pm\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 3:30am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Sunday, Jun 2 at 7:30pm\"}]","episode_title":"","desc":"Everyone's favorite curious monkey returns for more fun-filled adventures in the all-new animated movie, \"Curious George: Royal Monkey.\" In a case of mistaken identity, George is accidentally swapped with an identical-looking Royal Monkey with a totally different personality.

Will the trio find their way safely back to Pisghetti's sink? And will George finally understand that rain is astounding? \/ Rollerskating through the park, George hears a strange noise coming from the bushes and discovers a funny- looking little creature he's never seen before! Was this a lizard... or maybe an alien? The Man with the Yellow Hat explains that it's a baby bird, and for expert assistance they call a volunteer at the city's wildcare - Mr. Zoobel! The baby won't eat the bird seed (although Compass loves it!), and with no bird parents in sight, George and Zoobel take it to the wildcare center. Dr. Aziz says the baby is hungry but healthy - and it's a pigeon! George is thrilled! He happily feeds the baby and makes it the most comfy bed. But when George goes to leave, the baby sadly squawks - it must be lonely! How can George make the baby feel less homesick? With Compass' help, George learns that pigeons of a feather indeed flock together.","episode_number":1514,"image":"<img src=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/curious-george-1920-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Curious George logo\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/curious-george-1920-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/curious-george-1920-320x180.jpg 320w, https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/curious-george-1920-640x360.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/>","hours":0,"minutes":28,"seconds":55,"start_time":"10:00 AM","end_time":"10:28 AM","genres":"[\"Kids\"]","rating":"TV-Y","package_type":"HDPKID","is_pledge":"false","is_new":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.tpt.org\/curious-george\/","start":true},{"program_id":220646,"show_wp_post_id":31619,"channel":"TPTKIDS","series_title":"Curious George","upcoming_air_dates":"[{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Friday, May 31 at 10am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Friday, May 31 at 10:30am\"},{\"channel\":\"TPT KIDS\",\"time\":\"Saturday, Jun 1 at 10am\"}]","episode_title":"George-O-Matic\/Curious George, Sheep Herder","desc":"George-O-Matic - George is entranced by the museum's newest addition: a vending machine full of levers, wheels, springs, and healthy snacks!
