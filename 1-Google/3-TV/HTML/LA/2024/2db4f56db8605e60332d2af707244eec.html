Don Kelly, a Democrat from Natchitoches Parish who was close to former Gov. Edwin Edwards. Kelly helped set up Ware, which is run by a state board made up of local law enforcement officials and judges, and helped direct tens of millions of dollars of public money to the facility over several years.</p><p class="text | article-text">As the new head of the Office of Juvenile Justice, Loftin would oversee the agency that has traditionally provided Ware with most of its funding and is partially in charge of making sure it follows state laws and government regulations.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">One former state juvenile justice official, Glenn Holt, told <i>The New York Times </i>Loftin had little respect for state oversight of Ware when he was running the center, describing state inspections as a waste of time. The news investigation also revealed the Ware did not always report sexual abuse allegations made against staff at the facility to the state as required.</p><p class="text | article-text">Loftin’s ascent comes at an interesting time for the Office of Juvenile Justice’s relationship with Wade. The state had contracted with Wade to house all of the girls and young women put into the juvenile justice system’s secure care program under a contract Loftin helped secure for the detention center in 2009. But the Office of Juvenile Justice <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/09/27/louisiana-pulls-incarcerated-girls-out-controversial-youth-prison/">abruptly ended that arrangement</a> with the facility last September. Outgoing state juvenile justice director Curtis Nelson said his agency could not afford to pay the additional $600,000 Ware requested this year to house just 24 young girls and women. The detention center was already receiving $2.9 million annually to take care of that same group.</p><p class="text | article-text">Ware had also erroneously enrolled the girls in Medicaid to cover their healthcare needs, even though the federal government prohibits incarcerated people from receiving Medicaid benefits, Nelson said. As a result, the state had to absorb an extra $2.5 million to $3 million per year for the girls’ healthcare expenses.</p><p class="text | article-text">Even with this contract canceled, Ware isn’t sitting empty. The state still pays the facility to run juvenile justice substance abuse programs and group homes on the site. Some of those contracts would likely fall under Loftin’s control at the Office of Juvenile Justice.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">State Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, has expressed concern about Loftin’s appointment. ”The reports about Ware from the NYT were beyond disturbing. OJJ clearly needs wholesale reform,” Duplessis wrote in a text message Wednesday. “If Mr. Loftin was in charge of Ware at that time, there are serious questions about whether this is a move in the direction toward improving OJJ.”</p><p class="text | article-text">Loftin will need Senate confirmation to take the post.</p><p class="text | article-text">Senate President Cameron Henry (R-Metairie) said he was not familiar with the NYT story and would need to read it before commenting.</p><p class="text | article-text">Senate Pro Tempore Regina Barrow (D-Baton Rouge) said she was concerned by the allegations and would contact Henry.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">State Rep. Alonzo Knox (D-New Orleans) <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2023/12/14/architect-juvenile-policy-task-force-calls-ojj-transparency-escapes/" target="_blank">crafted a task force</a> on juvenile justice policy and said he wanted to speak with Loftin.</p><p class="text | article-text">“[The article] is beyond troubling, most of what I read was disgusting. To have something of that nature to go on for as long as it has, and have little investigation to produce outcome is troubling to me,” he said.</p><p class="text | article-text">Thursday morning, Inspector General Stephen Street confirmed an “exhaustive” probe into Ware is ongoing. He declined to comment on the NYT allegations.</p><p class="text | article-text">However, Thursday afternoon (2/1), Landry’s office sent FOX a letter from Street dated Feb. 1. It stated the letter was sent at the request Landry’s legal team.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">It stated the investigation into the facility was complete, but the report is not finalized.</p><p class="text | article-text">It reads in part:</p><p class="text | article-text">“We have no information that Mr. Loftin violated any laws, rules of ethics, or otherwise engaged in any conduct that would be disqualifying from appointment to government service.”</p><p class="text | article-text">When contacted about the seeming conflict between the two statements, Street reaffirmed the letter’s contents.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><figure class="media-item | figure video | media-item-video pb-3 w-100" data-video-asset="b5977009-3c7f-4fd7-ba0a-83c3170030bc"><div class="figure-wrapper img-wrapper figure-img mb-0 position-relative"><script type="application/ld+json" data-schema="VideoObject">{

He was considered one of the more conservative and rigid board members appointed by John Bel Edwards.</p><p class="text | article-text">Loftin was perceived to be more reluctant to grant release to incarcerated people than most of his other peers on the board. Notably, he was one of two members in 2018 who denied release to Henry Montgomery, then a 71-year-old incarcerated person whose Supreme Court case was instrumental in extending the possibility of freedom to hundreds of prisoners across the country.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">A model prisoner, Montgomery served more than 50 years behind bars after being convicted in the 1963 killing of East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Deputy Charles Hunt when Montgomery was 17. He was given life without parole, meaning he was supposed to die incarcerated without the possibility of release.</p><p class="text | article-text">In response to an appeal from Montgomery, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that he and other people sentenced to a life of imprisonment as minors needed to be given an opportunity for freedom. The court said teenagers don’t have fully developed brains and should not necessarily be held responsible for the rest of their lives for actions they take as children. Their cases require reexamination. Montgomery was eventually granted parole, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/crime-louisiana-montgomery-henry-montgomery-f74f4e7351b3d72bd1ce1685279c9727">on his third try</a>, when Loftin was no longer a member of the parole panel weighing his case.</p><div class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"></div><div id="fusion-static-enter:TQT2J3JHIVFNNPP5AATWZLKQ3A" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="TQT2J3JHIVFNNPP5AATWZLKQ3A"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div>
