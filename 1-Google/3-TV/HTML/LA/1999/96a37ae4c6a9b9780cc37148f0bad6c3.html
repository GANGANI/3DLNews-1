<p>BATON ROUGE &ndash; A man on death row for strangling and killing a woman in Texas is now facing charges in Louisiana, tied to a notorious 1999 murder in Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge Police released the details Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Travis Dwight Green, 49, is the suspect in the death of Kassie Federer. Federer, a Tangipahoa Parish native and an LSU psychology student just shy of her 20th birthday, was found shot to death in her apartment overlooking City-Brooks Park on Park Boulevard in September 1999.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.wbrz.com/videos/watch-wbrz-report-from-1999-on-federer-murder-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&gt; WATCH:</strong></span> 1999 WBRZ&nbsp;news report</a></p>
<p>Police have been working the case for nearly two decades and nearly five years ago found an unidentified DNA match when testing old evidence saved from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Federer&rsquo;s death has been one of the city&rsquo;s most high-profile, unsolved murders.</p>
<p>Her killing occurred a time when Baton Rouge was in pandemonium &ndash; as two serial killers ran the streets.&nbsp; Women lived in fear, reports of the era suggested.</p>
<p>In Federer&rsquo;s case, police had a puzzling situation: The crime scene was relatively organized, Federer was attacked while she was coming home from school. Her apartment was not ransacked but the front door was smashed as if someone had broken in.&nbsp; Federer was fully clothed and seemed to be trying to escape. She was found near a "portable phone." Only her backpack was missing, reports of the crime suggest.</p>

<p>Her dog was inside her bedroom and the lights to the unit were on when she was found by a building manager about an hour after being killed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does appear that she had time to grab a phone in an attempt to call 911,&rdquo; a police officer who worked the case told <em>America&rsquo;s Most Wanted</em>.</p>
<p>Green, the man just identified as the suspect in Federer&rsquo;s murder, is on death row in Texas for the rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman in Texas eleven days before Federer was killed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNA linked Green to the 19-year-old&rsquo;s murder in Texas, according to prison records.</p>
<p>Police in Baton Rouge said in a news release Tuesday, they used DNA to tie Green to Federer's murder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In newly-released police reports, detectives said DNA found on the inside of a glove taken from the Park Boulevard apartment was used to match Green to the killing.</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts reported seeing a man matching Green's description at the apartment complex around the time of the shooting in 1999.&nbsp;</p>
