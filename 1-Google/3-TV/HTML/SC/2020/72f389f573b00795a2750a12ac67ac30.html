This combination of events made it impossible for Donald Trump to get a fair trial. This verdict says more about the system than the allegations.

While in college, Kennedi interned at WIS in Columbia, SC and WBTV in Charlotte, NC. She also joined the National Association of Black Journalist and served as her University chapter vice-president.\n\nAfter graduating college, Kennedi began her career at FOX Carolina's sister station WRDW/WAGT, News 12 in Augusta, Ga. Within her first year in Augusta, Kennedi was promoted to cover the City/Government beat. On top of keeping up with city business she did investigative pieces and covered stories of national interest, including the 1-year anniversary of Ahmaud Arbery’s death and the 7-day murder trial for 3 former-Washington County deputies.\n\nShe joined FOX Carolina in June 2022.\n\nNow, she’s looking forward to telling stories in her hometown area. As a child, Kennedi was always curious and loved having a camera in her hand; she turned those passions into a career. Her favorite question to ask is “why?” She hopes to make a positive difference in the Upstate.\n\nMy favorite kind of music: R&B and anything Beyonce drops\nMy favorite food: Chicken alfredo\nHidden talents: I can paint and draw\nHobbies: Yoga, watching documentaries, spending time with family\nPets: I have a Cockapoo named Cooper \n\nMost memorable story you've covered:\nMy most memorable story is participating in Augusta’s Point in Time Count. It’s an overnight, annual count of the homeless population living on the streets. In the middle of the night, I joined a team of volunteers and County Marshal’s to survey Augusta’s homeless population, the highest the city had ever counted, in the middle of a housing crisis. The story highlighted the realities of living without shelter and the need for resources in Augusta.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"whns","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10","last_updated_date":"2022-07-21T18:36:24.867Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T02:21:34.575Z","description":{"basic":"They

Having the passion to do all three is what makes a really good news reporter.\n\nEducation: Bachelor of Arts in Journalism with a double minor in Criminal Justice and Strategic Communication from High Point University.\n\nHometown: Davidson, N.C.\n\nFamily: My parents, Jeff and Gina, and younger brother, John, all reside in Davidson, N.C. All of my extended family is from the Lake Norman area, where I grew up all my life!\n\nHobbies & Interests: When I’m not making anything and everything about journalism, I enjoy taking dance classes (especially tap), reading and hanging out with my friends and family.\n\nFavorite Books/Music/Movie: I absolutely love any mystery or thriller novel. The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides and Verity by Colleen Hoover are two of the best books. I am also a die-hard Taylor Swift, Harry Styles and Shania Twain fan. The song, “Fireball” by Pitbull is just an added bonus.\n\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: Charleston, S.C. has always been one of my favorite cities to visit and I could not be more excited to move here. The charm, class and food are incomparable to anywhere else.\n\nMost Interesting Assignment: During my sophomore year at HPU, I created a podcast for one of my classes about squatters in my hometown. Squatters had invaded the mayor of Davidson’s parents’ home when it was vacant and they refused to leave. I interviewed the mayor and a local real estate agent about their perspectives and it kick-started my passion for investigative journalism. The story won “Best Broadcast Journalism Story” departmental award from the Nido R.

Communication.\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2024-01-03T19:02:23.415Z","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/AnnaHarrisLive5","twitter":"annajamesharris"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-30T02:34:18.172Z","description":{"basic":"A

We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick

WRNN-TV(Rye Brook, NY) Producer \nNews Philosophy: Information can be more powerful than anything else in this world and no one understands that better than the journalists who pursue it every day. We're entrusted with the mightiest tool to keep everyone informed, elected officials honest and to document the first rough draft of history. It's a responsibility and a passion I don't take lightly. \nHometown: White Plains, New York (30 minutes north of New York City)\nEducation: Media Communications B.A. from the University of Delaware, with minors in political communication and Spanish\nFamily: I've got folks spread across the country, from New York to Austin, Texas to California's Central Valley. I'm quite positive I'm the first to settle in Charleston, but I can't wait for them to visit. \nHobbies and Interests: When I'm not in the grind of keeping up with the daily news, I'm big about turning off my phone and enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, yoga & digital photography. Plus, when I'm not feeling up to a new adventure, snuggling with my sweet cat Amiga makes me just as happy too. \nFavorite Books/Music: Book: Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger; Music taste: Varies from Pop to Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and of course, you can't forget the oldies but goodies (passed down by my lovely parents).\nLikes Best About the Lowcountry: The thriving culture and mix of people from all walks of life. I love that I have so many places to explore including (and especially) the beach!\nMost Interesting Story I've Covered: In a classic David vs Goliath case, in 2021 50+ South Plains (Texas) grape growers filed a $560 million suit against Big Ag company Bayer-Monsanto blaming irreparable crop damage on years of chemical drift from its herbicide called Dicamba. They claim the company set aside millions for future legal action and was well aware that the herbicide, used specifically on GMO cotton (the area's largest cash crop), could vaporize in the extreme west Texas heat and affect other crops. It was remarkable to see the little guys (who are responsible for producing 80% of the grapes that support the state's burgeoning wine industry) take a stand in an area where \"cotton is king.\"","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2023-12-21T18:32:15.187Z","facebook":"https://twitter.com/BlairSabolTV","twitter":"BlairSabolTV"}}},{"_id":"patrick-phillips","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Patrick
