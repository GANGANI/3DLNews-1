Coast, as part of his work with the Cochran Firm, to defend Bo Stefan Eriksson, who allegedly smashed  a red Ferrari Enzo into a utility pole going somewhere between 100-200 mph and is charged with grand theft auto and embezzlement, among other charges.</p><p class="text | article-text">A judge has now ordered what's left of the car be shipped back to Great Britain along with a black Enzo and Mercedes-Benz SLR.  All three vehicles are to be released to British banks.</p><p class="text | article-text"><em>Update:  Parkman was very bothered by this, saying that his client: "had several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equity in those automobiles, now my client is left wondering about the wealth invested in those automobiles."</em></p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">With the national spotlight soon to be on Mr. Parkman again, I thought it would be a good time for folks to learn more about the lawyer who, high tech guy he is, outlined his arguments in the HealthSouth case on the back of church offering envelopes during a Sunday service.  Some folks you talk to firmly believe he'll continue his success out in Los Angeles, others are waiting for him to fall flat on his face.  Parkman knows what he's capable of doing and takes it all in stride.  I sat down with him in his Birmingham office to learn a little more about how he got to where he is now.</p><div id="fusion-static-enter:RQTRCX66CRCKVJXQIZXJX77G6Q" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="RQTRCX66CRCKVJXQIZXJX77G6Q"></div><div

adopted by a family that provided him with the life lessons that would eventually take hold and even make a few good stories for the courtroom.</p><p class="text | article-text">Parkman says his parents and grandparents were "true southern gentlemen and true southern ladies."  He says the major thing he learned from them is "if you start something, you finish it - no matter what it is...It's easy today to start something, no matter what it is, start something and then go, 'Aw, I don't like this.'  But I've learned you've got to finish it if you start it, no matter what that may be, whether it's something as simple as a game, whether it's something that you don't like doing - cooking or whatever, or law.  It doesn't matter."</p><p class="text | article-text">He says his grandparents taught him another important lesson early on.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"They passed this early on to me and I'll never forget it - 'It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.'  And so, I've always carried that with me wherever I go.  I think that has influenced me a lot too along with the idea don't quit."</p><p class="text | article-text"><strong>Childhood Trouble</strong></p><p class="text | article-text">Like most kids, Parkman had his share of violations of the family rules.</p><p class="text | article-text">"I don't think I was a bad kid.  I think the major problems I had as a child was lying about where I'd been and getting caught most of the time with the lies."  He admits he had to go get a few twigs off the tree.  "The story was true, if you didn't bring back the right twig, it got worse.  So yes, that was an important thing to learn."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"But I think lying to 'em.  They'd say, 'Where have you been?' and I'd say, 'the library,' and I was over at some girl's house, you know.  And they knew better, because they'd been to the library."</p><p class="text | article-text">Parkman admits his tag as a "ladies man" came "pretty early.  I've always kind of liked the ladies and certainly enjoyed the dating scene during college and high school.  It was a lot of fun."</p><p class="text | article-text">So who did this future hot shot attorney admire as a kid.  Parkman says as far as heroes go, he had two.  "My dad was one.  He was absolutely a hero to me.  He was the greatest man I ever met.  The greatest man I've never met was Perry Mason.  I loved watching him and that's when I kind of got into the law stuff.  I really wanted to be a lawyer even back as early as 8,9,10 years old.  And, I would watch Perry Mason and I just thought that was unbelievable how he did it and everything.  So, those two right off the bat."</p><div id="fusion-static-enter:TLZGSHFKE5BURLQ6XA3GIE7YS4" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="TLZGSHFKE5BURLQ6XA3GIE7YS4"></div><div

I can't tell you why.  It just was fascinating to me at the time and so when I got out I knew I wanted to go in the courtroom.  I knew that, but I didn't.  I had my mind set on civil litigation and then it didn't work out that way."</p><p class="text | article-text"><strong>Back to Dothan</strong></p><p class="text | article-text">Parkman is proud of the fact that he got his act together in law school.   "Law school is a different entity than high school or college, so I did real well, whereas in college and high school I just played around a lot.  But I really applied myself and I graduated Cum Laude out of law school so I was real proud of that."</p><p class="text | article-text">After graduation from Cumberland in 1979, Parkman says because of his law school record he had some good interviews with some good firms and offers from Birmingham and Chattanooga.  He says he was pleased with the offers but someone asked him a question.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">'Jim, what would you rather be? A big fish in a little pond or a little fish in a big pond.'  Well, it made sense at that time, because I never dreamed that I could be a big fish in a big pond, so I took the big fish in the little pond role and I went back to Dothan."</p><p class="text | article-text"><strong>Taking What He Could Get</strong></p><p class="text | article-text">Upon his return to Dothan, the new attorney did a little bit of everything in the beginning.  "My first case was 30 days after I got admitted to the bar on October 1st.  It was a murder case and that was my very first trial and so from there it went mainly, I was doing more criminal work than anything else - a little civil work, a little divorce stuff. "</p><p class="text | article-text">The Dothan lawyer was married at the time, "plaintiff number one," says the man whose record in the marriage department is well known.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"You know, if it paid, I'd go, no matter what it was.  You know because you're trying to make a living for your family at that point.  So if they wanted me to go stand on the courthouse steps and announce sales of real estate, I'd go do it as long as it gave me 10 bucks, so I'd be happy at it.  So I did a little bit of everything."</p><p class="text | article-text">Parkman says like most lawyers he has some great stories.  "Things happen to me that just don't happen to anybody else."  But the man who is seldom at a loss for words says he "can't remember half of what I've ever dealt with, really.  So it's not, it's just my brain is so overloaded with things I just can't remember, you know, and when I did 'em - that's my major problem."</p><p class="text | article-text">I asked him if he suffered from old timer's disease and he responded, "I must have something because people ask me, 'Well, don't you remember doing my case back in '94?' and I go, 'I don't even remember '94, how was it? Was it good?'"</p><p class="text | article-text">The natural story teller finally says, "I had good cases, you know just different kind of things, just unusual little events take place."  With a little more prodding, I get him to tell me one of his stories.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div id="fusion-static-enter:AKZ6UYHSOBBZZMNRZ2CL46DB6Q" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="AKZ6UYHSOBBZZMNRZ2CL46DB6Q"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><p><strong>The Witness Eats the Evidence</strong><img border="0" class="video" hspace="2" src="http://wsfa.images.worldnow.com/images/static/video/gfx/icon_video.gif"/><a href="javascript:playVideo('863444', 'Stories, The Witness Who Ate the Evidence, and Puddles in the Courtroom', 'v', 'News - Special Coverage', '212933', 'News - Special Coverage', 'fvCatNo=&amp;backgroundImageURL=', 'www.WSFA.com');"><b><font style="FONT-SIZE: 10px; COLOR: #000099; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana,Arial; TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Stories, The Witness Who Ate the Evidence, and Puddles in the Courtroom</font></b></a></p></div></div><div id="fusion-static-exit:AKZ6UYHSOBBZZMNRZ2CL46DB6Q" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="AKZ6UYHSOBBZZMNRZ2CL46DB6Q"></div><p class="text | article-text">"I was cross examining a guy one day and he ate my evidence.  It was a criminal case and the long story short was he had written a note to my client that was an exculpatory note, it really helped my client tremendously with what it said.  And this guy was the victim in the crime and he got on the stand and so I had this little piece of paper that was about half of a sheet of notebook paper and he had handwritten on there and it had evidence on there that helped us and I went up and showed it to him, and he recognized it and said, 'Yeah that's my handwriting.'"</p><p class="text | article-text">"The prosecutor objected and the judge said, 'Let's go outside and take this up outside,' and he told the jurors to stay where they are, told the witness to stay where he is and we went outside and we talked about the note and I told them what it said and everything.  The judge said, 'It's coming in.'"</p><p class="text | article-text">"So, we came back in the courtroom and I went back up to the witness to get the note and I couldn't find it.  And I couldn't remember if I took it outside or if I left it with him; it's just one of those, you know, blanks that you have and I'm kinda looking and about that time a lady on the front row goes, 'He ate it.' And I went, 'What?'  I mean you're not even supposed to talk to the jury, but it was just out.  I said, 'What?' And she said, 'He ate it.  I saw him eat it.  He put it in his mouth and chewed it up.' And the one next to her goes, 'Yeah, I saw him swallow it.  It went down his throat.'  And then the deputy's standing over in the courtroom, he's going, 'Judge, I'll take him outside to the bathroom.  I'll get it out of him.  We can get that note back.'"</p><p class="text | article-text">"And so he (the witness) is sitting there smiling.  There's chaos, all the jurors are going, 'I saw him too judge.  He ate it.  He put the paper in his mouth and chewed.'  So it was just total bedlam.  So finally the judge stopped everything and then granted a mistrial...and then they dismissed the charges later on that case."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text"><strong>Puddles</strong></p><p class="text | article-text">"Had a lady one time.  I was cross examining and the bailiff stopped the courtroom and said, 'Judge we need to take a recess.'

Remember, there are 12 people over there.  Somebody else may have something more important than what a newscaster thought.  On the other hand, you don't ever feel the vibes that are going on in a courtroom, and whether you are winning.  You can tell.  I mean it's just obvious.  You can feel it in you, if you've had a good day or not.  So, with that in mind, You know I went with what I read and I'd seen and what I'd heard and yeah, I was surprised."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"I was surprised from the beginning. I couldn't ever figure out how we were ever going to get there unless Siegelman took some of that money and bought a lake house, or a condo, or some big home or some big Cadillac or something with the money.  I couldn't figure out how they (the government) was going to get there."</p><p class="text | article-text">"Obviously, the prosecution did a good job and I applaud them.  Any time that a prosecutor wins a case that I don't think they should win, I applaud them, because they've done a good job, and they obviously did.  They communicated their message very well, obviously, to the jury.  I just don't know enough about it to determine whether or not it could have been done differently for the defense or not.  I don't even know what theory they used, what they went under.  I have some of my ideas that I would have done different probably from things I've heard, that I think are damaging."</p><p class="text | article-text"><strong>The Race Card</strong></p><p class="text | article-text">During both opening statements and closing arguments attorney Fred Gray, who had been added to the Scrushy defense team after jury selection, made reference to his past associations with Martin Luther King and tried, particularly in closing arguments, to tie Scrushy and King together.  Parkman had some definite views on the propriety of the comments and their repercussions.</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"When that happened, I knew right off the bat that was going to be very damaging to the defense.  You know, I've learned in the practice of law that the race card - and that's any time you try to use race as a means of trying to exculpate your client or to get that verdict that you want for your client,no matter how you use it.  But the race card is not something to be toyed with or tinkered with. It's a very serious item in our society today.  It better involve a racial issue and it better be a good one if you're going to play that card, because if it's not, generally it's going to backfire on you.  And I'm not talking about just with white jurors.  I'm talking about with black jurors, because they don't want you playing that card either, in my opinion."</p><p class="text | article-text">"So, for him to get up there and do it when there's no race involved in the case.  There's no reason whatsoever that I was aware of involved in this matter so don't even bring it up. I mean, I don't see why you would want to do that and jeopardize that and so to get up and to compare anybody to anybody in a racial manner isn't going to work in my opinion.  And obviously I was correct, 'cause it didn't work, nor would it."</p><p class="text | article-text">"And then I think, they, somebody, told me they (the defense) went back and redid it in the closing, and that, good gracious alive, I mean, you know, and how are you going to compare.  That's like comparing apples and oranges.  I mean, I think a lot of Richard Scrushy, but he's not the same person that Martin Luther King is nor is Martin Luther King the same thing that Richard Scrushy is.  So, you're comparing, when you're saying, I did this and this is the same here - you can't do it, it's impossible."</p><p class="text | article-text">"This is a case involving Richard Scrushy and it's about whether or not there's a bribe involved and that's it and that's what you've got to communicate to the jury and why not, not race."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><div id="fusion-static-enter:KIXQYDP5EFE6DPUTZH3MYCR7VQ" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="KIXQYDP5EFE6DPUTZH3MYCR7VQ"></div><div class="article-raw-html w-100 mb-3"><div><p><strong>Prosecutors</strong><img border="0" class="video" hspace="2" src="http://wsfa.images.worldnow.com/images/static/video/gfx/icon_video.gif"/><a href="javascript:playVideo('863460', 'Prosecutors, Indict Everybody!

'How could he say something like that? How could he do that?' And my answer was simple - thank goodness!  You know, thank goodness!  Put everybody in jail, because when you start doing that, you start making money as a lawyer.  If you start just telling people don't do this again and go away, they don't need a lawyer for that.  So, I said all he's done is raised the business."</p><div class="w-100" style="height:90px"></div><p class="text | article-text">"And so for prosecutors that are, if there are any prosecutors out there listening, indict everybody!
