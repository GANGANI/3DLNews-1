Weather just came naturally to me.</p>   \n\n<p>I took every opportunity I had growing up to become a meteorologist.\" At 13, he became the youngest Weather Watcher for WSFA in Montgomery, AL. This allowed him to become friends with and learn from some of the best meteorologists in the business. He became an advanced SkyWarn Spotter before he even graduated high school and when presented the opportunity will chase anything from blizzards to tornadoes to hurricanes.</p>  \n\n\n<p>Patrick is a native of Seale, Alabama. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from the University of South Alabama with a concentration in Broadcast in 2015. While in school, he was the Chief Meteorologist for “AtmosCenter,\" a student-ran, daily weathercast for the school, and he was also the meteorologist for the school newspaper, TV, and radio station. He also interned at WSFA in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>  \n\n\n<p>Patrick gained notoriety during the tornado that hit the Pine Belt in January of 2017. When the station's audio was knocked out by the storm, Patrick grabbed a piece of paper and a Sharpie and wrote, “No Sound Tornado on the Ground in Petal,” holding it in front of the camera in an effort to warn viewers of the danger.</p>  \n\n\n<p>He has also won multiple Best of the Pine Belt awards for \"Best Local TV Personality\" and has even been Nominated for an Emmy Award.</p>  \n\n<p>When not keeping an eye on the weather, Patrick enjoys trains, photography, Auburn football (War Eagle!), NASCAR, being outdoors, and spending time with his wife Rachel. He also enjoys spending time with his friends and family as well as his two cats, Chessie and Sweetie.</p>  ","org":"WDAM","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"Chief Meteorologist","slug":"patrick-bigbie","source":{"source_id":"52360"},"status":true,"twitter":"PatrickWDAM","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2023-12-09T00:51:22.662Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wdam","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2024-05-29T23:48:10.230Z","description":{"basic":"Tomorrow will be partly cloudy with a few hit-or-miss thunderstorms during the afternoon hours."},"headlines":{"basic":"Rain chances will increase later this week.","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/kqcin9DQO2xPDCVEnIpUfVhDpBA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","galleries":[],"keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"t_ec6cf4209a8e408b93c3733986812469_name_file_1280x720_2000_v3_1_.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/kqcin9DQO2xPDCVEnIpUfVhDpBA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/kqcin9DQO2xPDCVEnIpUfVhDpBA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/NqDhlYSOgkHSIYrOx9DINd-C-Wg=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","version":0},"address":{},"auth":{"3":"543c3ba325c8517cde1210b5d71f35d94a0aab6f086b9013b327bf5963b68445"},"caption":"Patrick's Wednesday PM Forecast 5/29","created_date":"2024-05-29T23:47:46Z","height":720,"last_updated_date":"2024-05-29T23:47:46Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"gray"},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Patrick's Wednesday PM Forecast 5/29","type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/6WDO3AWGCFHXXHP4ODZFNPCDOU.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":1280,"imageId":null,"ingestImageToAnglerfish":true,"photographer":null,"usage_instructions":null},"lead_art":{"type":"video","websites":{"wdam":{"website_section":{"path":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wdam","name":"Forecast","_id":"/weather/forecast","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","primary":true},"website_url":"/video/2024/05/29/patricks-wednesday-pm-forecast-529/"}}}},"source":{"system":"composer"},"type":"story","version":"0.10.10","website":"wdam","websites":{"wdam":{"website_section":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wdam","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast","alias_ids":["/weather/forecast"]},"order":{"publishing-sections":2005},"_website":"wdam","site":{"pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps":"/weather/forecast/","site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{},"parent":{"publishing-sections":"/weather","default":"/weather"},"name":"Forecast","inactive":false,"ancestors":{"footer-content-links":[],"navigation-navbar-links":[],"sales-nav-links":[],"navigation-menu-links":[],"publishing-sections":["/"],"default":["/"]},"social":{},"node_type":"section","site_topper":{}}},"_website_section_id":"wdam./weather/forecast"},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/rain-chances-will-increase-later-this-week/"}},"_id":"NU7RSMHG3FFXHH77TC2O7KXAUY","taxonomy":{"sections":[{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_website":"wdam","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Forecast","path":"/weather/forecast","parent_id":"/weather","parent":{"default":"/weather"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/weather/forecast","_admin":{"dfp_id":"/weather/forecast","alias_ids":["/weather/forecast"]},"order":{"publishing-sections":2005},"_website":"wdam","site":{"pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps":"/weather/forecast/","site_title":"Forecast"},"navigation":{},"parent":{"publishing-sections":"/weather","default":"/weather"},"name":"Forecast","inactive":false,"ancestors":{"footer-content-links":[],"navigation-navbar-links":[],"sales-nav-links":[],"navigation-menu-links":[],"publishing-sections":["/"],"default":["/"]},"social":{},"node_type":"section","site_topper":{}}},"_website_section_id":"wdam./weather/forecast"}]},"website_url":"/2024/05/29/rain-chances-will-increase-later-this-week/","hasVideo":true,"hasVideoCenterVideo":true,"hasClickabilityVideo":false,"hasPowaLiveVideoPlayer":false},{"canonical_url":"/2024/05/29/hattiesburg-city-pools-open-monday/","content_elements":[{"_id":"U476BO4P7NB5NHX4K2KQPQHFWE","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1622145074276,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"HATTIESBURG, Miss.

She graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Mississippi where she was also a Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College graduate.\n\nWhile at Ole Miss, Courtney Ann worked as anchor, reporter and producer for NewsWatch, the student-run live broadcast. She was selected as the station's only credentialed Spin Alley reporter at the 2008 Presidential Debate that was held on campus. She continued to sharpen her reporting skills while working as an intern for Talk Radio News Service in Washington, D.C. She reported daily on Senate and House hearings, press conferences and various events throughout the city.\nShe has worked as an on-air reporter in Jackson since 2010. She is currently on air for both WLBT and FOX 40 and is the 6:00 p.m. co-anchor and statewide reporter. As part of her statewide duties, she sends stories Monday-Friday to WCBI (Columbus), WTOK (Meridian), WDAM (Hattiesburg) and WLOX (Biloxi). \nJackson received the first place for TV Reporter in a Large Market during the 2021 Mississippi Association of Broadcasters Excellence in Broadcasting Awards. \n\nJackson covers the State Capitol during the legislative sessions each year, often times gaining exclusive interviews with policymakers and helping break down the most complex issues of the day for viewers across the state. Her statewide coverage isn’t limited to the Capitol. For example, she was sent to Los Angeles in 2016 to cover the American Idol finale and is often sent to other parts of the state for significant breaking news and weather events.\n\nShe’s covered a wide range of stories, including: presidential visits, prison riot protests, sit-down interviews with governors, votes and commission meetings to change and replace the state flag, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, statewide and congressional elections…just to name a few.\n\nCourtney Ann served as a panelist for the 2018 Mississippi U.S. Senate Debate hosted by WLBT and Mississippi Farm Bureau which was televised across the state. Her insight into that Senate special election also afforded her the opportunity to provide a Facebook live conversation for NBC News on how Mississippi’s election could impact the makeup of the Senate. \n\nJackson shoots and edits her own video, writes the stories and then appears on camera daily.\n\nHaving grown up in Mississippi, Courtney Ann knows there are extraordinary stories to be told in this state and she looks forward to uncovering more of them.\nCourtney Ann enjoys spending time with her husband, family and friends. When she’s not at work, she can be found cooking, entertaining, dancing, traveling, and exploring locally owned shops and restaurants.

She joined in October 2016.\n\nPatrice is a proud native of New Orleans, Louisiana, so she knows about good food and good times. As a child, she dreamed of being on television like her role model Oprah Winfrey.\nPatrice started out speaking at her church, Greater St. Stephen and different city events. Eager to get involved in the media as a child, Patrice worked at a radio station in New Orleans, AM 940, as a co-host of a local teen talk show.\nPatrice graduated from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana.  During college, she worked as a Reporter/Anchor for her college television station and KTIB local radio station. She also interned at FOX 8 News in New Orleans.\nAfter earning a degree in Journalism, Patrice moved back to her hometown and worked at WWL Television as an assistant assignment editor. She also helped produce the youth program \"Our Generation.\"\nPatrice then moved to South Mississippi to work as a tape-editor at WLOX, but she was determined to be in front the camera. In her off time, she worked on her writing and storytelling.  After a lot of hard work, her dream came true and she was offered the Jackson County bureau chief position.  She was also a weekend live reporter and fill-in anchor at WLOX.   In 2016, She made a move to Jackson, Mississippi, to continue telling people stories.\nShe has interviewed business leaders, former presidents, governors, and Hollywood celebrities. But what touches Patrice's heart the most is helping and informing people in the community, a goal she fights to accomplish with each story.\nWhile at WLBT, Patrice has won first place for Best Public Affairs reporting from the Louisiana-Mississippi Associated Press Broadcasters and Media Editors. She also won first place for best Short Light Feature.\nPatrice also reached an educational milestone in 2019. She graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mass Communication at Jackson State University. On top of that, she was the Salutatorian of her program.\nWhen Patrice is not chasing a breaking news, she loves traveling, reading good books, and spending time with her family, friends, and sorority sisters. Yes, she is proud member of Delta Sigma Theta. But shopping is Patrice's true love. She and her mom can spend all day going from store to store.\nPatrice is also very spiritual; she credits the Lord for all her blessings, including her journalism career.","org":"WLBT","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"role":"News
