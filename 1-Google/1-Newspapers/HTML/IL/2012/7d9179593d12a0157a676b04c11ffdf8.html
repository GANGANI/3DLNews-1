    <P>
Our second annual walk to aid in support of research to find a cure for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) took place Saturday, June 2nd, 2012 in La Harpe.  This year we had over 100 participants and raised over $4,000! 

<P>
It was a beautiful day and a great success! 

<P>
We hope you will join us again next year.
