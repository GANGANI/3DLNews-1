Aloha!  In April 2012 "The Quill" travelled to Maui, Hawaii with Barbara Peasley Thatcher, her husband Henry, along with their daughter, Gretchen Scheberies, her husband Fred and their three daughters, Jacklyn (11), Kathryn (9) and Emily (7).  Perfect weather and "Fun in the Sun" made for a perfect Spring Break Jacklyn, Kathryn & Emily.  While in Maui, Barbara and Henry celebrated their 46th Wedding Anniversary on April 9th at Mama's Fish House.  Barbara is from Stronghurst and she and Henry live in Danville, California and their daughter and her family live close by in Castro Valley, California.

When you go on a trip, take "The Quill" along and have your picture taken with it, then send it to us.  Let's see where all "The Quill" can travel.
