    Virginia Ross from Stronghurst, who writes a weekly history column from The Stronghurst Graphic for The Henderson County Quill, took "The Quill" along to the Hawkeye in Burlington, Iowa, to discuss county history with Bob Hansen, who writes stories for the weekly Sunday column, "52 Faces" for The Hawk Eye, Iowa's oldest newspaper. Both had stories to tell.

<P>
 When you go on a trip, take "The Quill" along and have your picture taken with it, and then send it to us. Let's see where all "The Quill" can travel.
