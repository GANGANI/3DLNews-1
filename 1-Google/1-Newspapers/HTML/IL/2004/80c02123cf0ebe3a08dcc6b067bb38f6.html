Not giving up, Colby found two co-workers of Nancy Cruzan who testified unequivocally that she had told them she would never want to live in that kind of state. He brought the case back to a lower Missouri court and they were given permission to remove the tube. It was removed December 14, 1990 and she died 12 days later, the day before Christmas</P><FONT SIZE=4><P>1989-90.
