      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Matthew Ryan Frazier</strong> died at the age of 44 Feb. 10, 2018 in Kansas City, Mo. Matt was born in Danville August 3, 1973 to his parents, Tim and Sally Frazier. He was raised in Catlin and always considered it home. His childhood was spent close to family, friends and what would become his favorite things &ndash; animals, music, fishing and the Chicago Cubs, Bears and the Illinois Fighting Illini.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On two occasions during his childhood, Matt courageously and successfully defeated brain tumors with the help of his parents and many medical professionals. Despite the hardship of years of treatment, Matt remained friendly, happy, optimistic and compassionate toward others. These traits would define his personality through the rest of his life.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On Nov. 15, 2008, he married Adrienne Leah Saccaro in Chillicothe, Mo.	Matt&rsquo;s love for dogs inspired him to start a pet care business in 2013, Paws &lsquo;n Motion. Through dedication to his customers and a fondness for their pets, Matt rapidly grew his business in a short amount of time, which now serves over 200 customers and more than 500 dogs and cats. His clients and their pets were treated like family by Matt, and in turn, many of them treated him like family as well. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the spring of 2017, the brain tumors that he battled in his youth reappeared. Thus began ten months of surgeries, treatments and many setbacks. Throughout these challenges, he kept a smile on his face, showed gratitude toward everyone that treated him and was the definition of toughness. His family was frequently told by many of those that treated him that he made as much, or more, of an impact on them than they did for him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He is survived by his wife Adrienne and son Drake of Kansas City; parents Tim and Sally of Kansas City; brother Jason of Nashville, Tenn.. Additional surviving family include father- and mother-in-law Jim and Nancie Saccaro; brother- and sister-in-law Mark and Amy Saccaro; and nephew Tate Saccaro; along with many aunts, uncles, cousins and extended family. He was preceded in death by grandparents Sid and Ruth Frazier, and Charles and Dorothy Caldwell; Aunt Susan Stamos; cousin Jack Ellis; and sister-in-law Melanie Tate Saccaro.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Funeral will be held Feb. 17 at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Kansas City, Mo. Memorial donations to benefit St. Thomas More School or the American Brain Tumor Association are greatly appreciated.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; A celebration of Ella Mae&rsquo;s life will be at 2 p.m. Friday, March 2, at Robison Chapel in Catlin with Pastor Randy Robinson officiating. Burial will follow in Greenview Cemetery in Fairmount. Visitation is from noon until service time at Robison Chapel. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ella Mae made her grand arrival into the world July 4, 1922, one of 10 children born to Samuel and Myrtle (Lazzell) Evans. She married Douglas W. Hamm June 22, 1945, and had three children, Glen (Carol) Hamm, Sandra (James) Brown and Caralena (Michael) Dungan.  Of those children, Ella Mae was given several grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ella Mae was the last surviving child of Samuel and Myrtle Evans. Waiting to greet her upon her return are siblings: an infant child, Valley (Evans) Gotchalk, Paul Evans, Bessie (Evans) Gooch, Chester Evans, Glen Evans, Virginia (Evans) Franklin, Georgia (Evans) Frerichs and Raymond &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; Evans. Also proceeding her in death are husband, Douglas; daughter Caralena; son-in-law James Brown; great-great-granddaughter LilyAnne Louise Hamm; several nieces and nephews; and a special friend, Carolyn Shutt. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ella Mae led her life as a Christian and was a member of St. James United Methodist church and Christian Women&rsquo;s Organization. She enjoyed attending the Christian Women&rsquo;s luncheons and contributing her time to church programs that helped those in need. She loved to crochet and often made homemade crafts for her friends and family; however, spending time with her loved ones singing, telling stories and playing cards are what gave her the most joy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; God gifted her with a tremendous amount of strength, courage, wisdom and resiliency. She was an ambassador for life and always found the goodness in the lives of others, and taught her family to live a life of goodness. To know her was a privilege, but to be a recipient of her unconditional love is an invaluable treasure so precious one cannot assign a price. Although the absence of her physical presence leaves, an irreplaceable void her love will remain in our hearts forever. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The family would like to thank Dee Nolan for her care and friendship given to our mother, as well as Dr. Thomas Halloran, Dr. Vasmi Vasireddy and staff for their care over the years. The family would also like to give extra gratitude to the staff of Carle Foundation Hospital sixth floor, specifically nurses Tim Nelson, RN, BSN and Rachelle RN who cared for Ella Mae during her transition. No words can ever describe how thankful we are for the love, compassion and care that was given to our loved one during this difficult time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In lieu of flowers, the family requests a donation in the honor of Ella Mae Hamm to the St. James United Methodist food pantry. Online condolences at www.robisonchapel.com.                    &nbsp; </p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Earl Miles</strong>, 93, of Dinuba, Calif., formerly of Sidell, died April 4, 2018 as a result of an auto accident.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Earl was born Nov. 22, 1924 in Sidell to Everett and Margaret Baker Miles. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He grew up in Sidell, one of 10 children. His younger sister, Barbara, died at the age of two when Earl was 10. She was &ldquo;his&rdquo; baby and he would often stay home from school to care for her.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he graduated Eighth Grade the town pitched in to purchase him a suit and shoes. That act of kindness resonated with him throughout his life. Earl was a very big financial supporter of many projects around Sidell continuing in recent years. He was a donor to the Sidell War Veteran&rsquo;s Memorial Board and to the Sidell Community Historical Society many times, sending donations every time he read in his hometown paper, the Sidell Journal/Reporter, which he still subscribed to, that a fundraising activity was taking place.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a 1942 graduate of Sidell High School and joined the U.S. Army at age 19.<br>
Earl was a POW captured October 1944 in Germany. He spent nine months in captivity before being freed by the Russians. He left the Army and turned around to join the Air Force where he was a Staff Sargent.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He met his wife, Jody, in San Pedro, Calif. in 1951. They wed on June 23. The following year they welcomed son, Kenneth. Five years later came Kathy followed by Kim another five years after.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Earl worked for the San Pedro USPS as a carrier and made a huge impact on the patrons he served. After retiring, they moved to Reedley, Calif. in 1985. After his wife died, 20 years ago, he moved from Reedley to Dinuba, Calif. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a regular at many restaurants, notably Friday night at Valentino&rsquo;s sitting in the window seat with family friend Heather Murphy. Wednesday mornings found him at Brook&rsquo;s Ranch and Monday, Wednesday and Friday he would be at Port-of-Sub&rsquo;s to meet up with the Romeos.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He has left behind his three children, Kenneth, Kathy (Terry) and Kim, four grandchildren: Sam, Nick, Stephanie (Kenneth), Tyler and his very dear friend, Sarah Alvarado and two brothers, Forest and Joe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He will be missed by those who knew him. In his memory pay forward his kindness and generosity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Graveside services were held April 13, 2018 at Reedley Cemetery. Memorial donations can be made to St. Jude&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Pl, Memphis, TN 38105; or your local Food Bank in Earl&rsquo;s name.<br>

      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>David Lee Meredith</strong>, beloved husband, father, brother, and friend, went to be with the Lord on Tues., Sept. 4, 2018. He passed sur-rounded by the family he loved so much. <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Dave was born in Sidell, on March 1, 1937, to Edmund Earl and Belva Grace Meredith. His youth was filled with the typical adventures, and misadventures, of a rural Midwest upbringing. He played basketball for the &rsquo;54 Sidell Rockets, his high school&rsquo;s district champion basketball team. He went on to earn his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business from Eastern Illinois University in Charleston. He used that degree for a career in finance and insurance. During his retirement, he worked as a groundskeeper at Eisenhower Golf Course, United States Air Force Academy, CO as it awarded him the opportunity to be in the outdoors and enjoy the company of others.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1954, Dave met the love of his life, Claudette Lee Vaughn. Four years later they were married. Their almost 60-year marriage was filled with love, laughter, challenge, and the joy of family. Their life together modelled what a marriage is meant to be. He taught his children, Julie, Ed, and Lori, to face all of life&rsquo;s challenges and joys with both faith in God and a sense of humor for which he was famous. <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Dave&rsquo;s love of, and talent for, music led him to lend his impressive bass voice to church choir, light opera, various quartets, and the occasional rendition among friends. He loved to golf. He enjoyed cars and could often be found at local car shows on the weekends. Even more, he loved hunting with his family and friends. He cherished the camaraderie of time spent in the mountains with the guys, joking, and telling stories and greatly looked forward to it each year he hunted. Most notably, Dave was a &ldquo;people person.&rdquo; He most enjoyed being amongst them putting his extraordinary personality to use making them smile and brightening their day. Above all, he loved his wife and family. And he made certain they knew it. The world is forever less bright for his loss, but heaven is the brighter for it.</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Norman Earl Emmert</strong>, 87, of rural Georgetown, passed away Dec. 11, 2018,<br>
surrounded by family.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Norman was born on March 1, 1931 in rural Brazil, Ind., the son of Harry R. and Dorothy (Rissler) Emmert. At the age of 20, he met Norma Keiser. They were married on his 21st birthday. She survives. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their union of 66 years began in Washington Township, Ind. There, they had two sons, Greg and Gary. In 1959, they moved to a farm in rural Georgetown where they would establish and operate what later became Terra Plana Family Farms. Norm was especially proud that their farming business would continue after his passing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Survivors include their sons, Greg (Pam) Emmert and Gary Emmert; one granddaughter, two step-grandchildren; two step great-grandchildren; a brother, Ross (Julia) Emmert; several nieces and nephews. He shared a special kinship with his brother-in-law Burl (Vicky) Keiser and his sister-in-law, Marylin (Hal) Petrie.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Norm graduated from Brazil High School in 1949. His interests were in all things farming and in carpentry. After settling on the farm near Georgetown, Norm and Norma set out to improve their farmstead and grow their business. He was blessed to continue his life&rsquo;s work almost uninterrupted until his unexpected passing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Norm was a fine carpenter, a herdsman of livestock and a farmer of crops. He especially valued the relationship he had with the men that worked with him on the farm. In recent years, Danny, Todd, Cory, and Butch tended to many of the tasks on the farm that he could no longer perform. He trusted and loved his farm family. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the 1970s and 80s, he and Norma owned Mill Street Lumber Company in Georgetown. He served as a director for the Georgetown Agricultural Fair Association and served the township for many years maintaining roads. He loved gardening and sharing his sweet corn patch with friends. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He spent many of his days mowing lawn and inspecting the farmstead with his beloved dogs. Norman Emmert never knew a short cut and rarely compromised on the principle that &ldquo;a job worth doing is worth doing well.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Funeral services were Dec. 15, 2018, at Robison Chapel in Catlin with Pastor Joe Humrichous officiating. Burial will was at Oakridge Cemetery in Catlin. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be sent to the Georgetown Agricultural Fair Association or the Fairview United Methodist Church. On-line condolences at www.robisonchapel.com.</p>
