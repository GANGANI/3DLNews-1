Oquawka- John Hallwas gave a forceful presentation of Abraham Lincoln's thoughts on "liberty" Friday morning at the Henderson County courthouse. The presentation was given at an unveiling of Lincoln's portrait taken in Springfield by well-known photographer Alexander Hesler. It was said it was the only portrait Lincoln ever liked. This beautiful framed copy is being placed in all 102 county courthouses as part of Illinois' Bicentennial celebration. Knox and McDonough counties were hung Friday as well with Chief Circuit Judge David Vancil Jr making the introductions and closing statements. Also speaking was Judge John Coady, of Taylorville, immediate past president of the Illinois Judges Association. Hanging-the 20x40" portrait were Chief Circuit Judge Ninth Judicial Circuit David Vancil, Jr., Circuit Judge Raymond Cavanaugh, Associate Judge Greg Baber, and Judge John Coady.
