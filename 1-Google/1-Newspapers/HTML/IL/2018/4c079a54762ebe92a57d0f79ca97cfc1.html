"The Quill" caught up with Doug Hobby, a former La Harpe resident. Doug was interviewed by "The Quill" in 2006, for a Business Spotlight and pictured above are the "then and now" family photos taken for that article and for today's.  

    <P>
        <img class="style2" src="p2102p2.jpg" /><P>
At that time, Doug owned Hobby Claim Service in La Harpe and his kids thought it would be fun to take a picture on the roof to show what their dad sometimes had to do for insurance claims.

<P>
Doug is a 1986 La Harpe High School graduate. In 1990, he earned his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Eureka College and has been an insurance adjuster for most of his career.

<P>
In August of 2008, Doug and his family moved to Nixa, Missouri, where he is currently a field claims adjuster in the Reinsurance Adjuster Program at Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company (Grinnell, IA).   

<P>
Grinnell Mutual is the largest direct reinsurer of farm mutual companies in North America. The Reinsurance Adjuster Program was created within the past few years. Farm Mutuals have an agreement with Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company whereby they inspect and adjust their property claims for them.  

<P>
Doug handles all kinds of claims including, but not limited to: theft, vandalism, water, hail, wind, fire, etc.  

<P>
A majority of the claims he handles are homeowner claims; however, he adjusts commercial claims as well.  In addition to adjusting duties, he is also required to complete risk inspections and assist other adjusters from their home office with liability and other types of investigations.   

<P>
Doug works out of his home and has a 26-county territory in southwest Missouri. He has been a claims adjuster for 24 years and has worked for Grinnell Mutual for 6 years. He says he enjoys the opportunity to help people in their time of need.

<P>
Doug also has a 2nd part-time job as a driver for Fisk Transportation in Springfield, MO. Fisk has a fleet of approximately 85 vehicles including: coaches, buses, limousines, sedans, and SUVs. 

<P>
This job has given him the opportunity to transport his son's high school soccer team to their long-distance tournaments, take both of his kids to Prom with their friends, and give his parents their first limo ride ever.  

<P>
Some of the notable people he has been privileged to meet and drive for include: Naomi Judd, Tony Orlando, John Schneider, Jerry Seinfeld, Newt Gingrich, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Dierks Bentley. He was also honored to drive a limousine for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  

<P>
Doug states, "I have found that this job is a nice break from my full-time job as I have found that I meet people in the worst of situations and conditions as an adjuster and most of the people that I drive for are enjoying some time away from the stresses of everyday life".

<P>
Doug says the most influential people in his life have been his parents and his wife, Tracy. 

<P>
He says "My parents have always taught me to put God first in all things. 

<P>
"There will be trials in life; however, I do not have to battle things alone, God is there and he cares and he wants to lead me through all situations. 

<P>
"Mom and Dad always modeled that for me growing up and they are still there for me today when I need advice or direction.  

<P>
"My wife, Tracy is my rock. I am so blessed to be married to such a godly woman. 

<P>
"She encourages me to be the best that I can be in all things that I do. 

<P>
"She brings stability and wisdom to our home. 

<P>
"I can count on her to research, study, and most importantly seek God about any decisions that we need to make".

<P>
He also says "Our kids are nearly on their own now; however, I have found great enjoyment over the years while they were growing up attending their school activities and being involved as much as possible.  

<P>
"Tracy and I tried not to miss any sporting events, school plays, or speech contests, etc. 

<P>
"Time goes by so fast and we endeavored to make the most of it.  

<P>
"We had the opportunity to open our house for youth life groups (60+ kids at one time oh my!) and to be youth leaders.  

<P>
"I also led a chapel for my son's high school soccer team this year and even had the opportunity to announce some of his games. 

<P>
"We also enjoy going on cruises as a family.  Family is important".

<P>
Doug has also been involved with a ministry called Men's Encounter for the last few years. 

<P>
Men's Encounter is a 48- hour weekend, where men from all walks of life, can experience the power and freedom, paid for by Jesus on the cross.  

<P>
There are 14 different sessions. Each session has a time of praise and worship, true life testimonies, and teaching from God's word. 

<P>
Doug says "It is just ordinary men sharing how God has changed their lives.  

<P>
"It is an amazing time in God's presence that every man should experience. 

<P>
"I have had the privilege of sharing Men's Encounter with many men from La Harpe and the surrounding areas, and I am hopeful that many more will attend".

<P>
Doug is the son of Larry and Judy Hobby of La Harpe.  

<P>
He has a sister, Pam (Jerry) Brown, and a brother Dave (Susan) Hobby also residing in La Harpe. 

<P>
He married his wife, Tracy, in 1993 and says they have been happily married for 25 years this April. 

<P>
Tracy is a District Coordinator for Sherwin-Williams.

<P>
They have two children: Kelsey Hobby (20 years old) is a junior at Evangel University majoring in Elementary Education and Riley Hobby (17 years old) is a senior at Nixa High School. 

<P>
Riley is undecided which college he will attend, but plans to major in International Relations and be a world traveler.

<P>
Doug says he misses making great memories with family and friends in La Harpe and misses the "small town" atmosphere where everyone truly knows your name and is quick to lend a helping hand.
