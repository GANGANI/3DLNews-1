<span style="font-size: medium;"><em><strong>News articles, social media salvos and false charges met with strong rebuke</strong></em></span></p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Jewish and Zionist groups who have harassed, slandered, and stalked Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan began spinning another web of deceit and lies after the Muslim leader delivered a powerful three-hour message to close the Nationâs annual Savioursâ Day convention in Chicago.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">It started weeks earlier, but like a wave built to a crescendo. The problem is the wave didnât wash away its target. Jewish efforts to force Black leaders and activists to publicly disavow the Minister were largely unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">And, the Jewish onslaught was met with a stinging rebuke by those who love the Minister, those who recognize his value to the Black community, and those who refuse to accept the 30-year-old lie that he is anti-Jewish.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âHere is what is always amazing to me,â observed Father Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina Catholic Church in Chicago. âWhen people like Billy Graham, or countless other White people and Christian people say the things that they say, people would (just) say they disagree with them.â

</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âWhen Farrakhan says the same things and points out wickedness when he sees it, heâs an anti-Semite, heâs a hater; he hates people; he hates Jews,â said Father Pfleger. âMinister Farrakhan hates evil. Whether itâs in White, Black, Brown, Jewish, Christian, Muslim. â¦Â  And when he points it out, they demonize him.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">The Catholic priest added, âWe have to value, surround and make sure we lift up Minister Farrakhan and the prophetic voices like him, so that we support them, because there are very few anymore. Prophetic voices are vanishing, theyâve grown silent and they are afraid,â he said. âAnd there are too many imams, pastors and rabbis that have sold out to the devil.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Munir Muhammad drew a diverse crowd of elected officials, judges and potential judges, professionals and corporate leaders to the March 4 annual fundraiser for the Coalition for the Remembrance of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad in Chicago (CROE). CROE preserves and presents the words and work of Elijah Muhammad through photos, videotapes, lectures, and broadcasts and special programs. It is a Nation of Islam archives.</p>
<p>After a couple of starts and pauses, he brought in Min. Farrakhan who offered brief words about Munir Muhammad and CROEâs work, which includes distribution of interviews and shows through a wide cable TV network and the Internet. Munir Muhammad was unapologetic in his embrace of the Minister and warned his audience about giving into fears and lies about Min. Farrakhan, a man who has worked for Black people.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Eleven-thousand people came to hear the Minister at the Wintrust Arena and he has been serving us for 62 years, said Munir Muhammad. Yet, he said, Whites can come and question you about taking a photo with him?Â  I love to take pictures with him and so do you, I saw you with your phones out, said Munir Muhammad. But, he added, these attacks and lies on the Minister should not be allowed. Min. Farrakhan is not a hater, he said.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph" align="center"><b>The failed âFarrakhan Litmusâ test</b></p>
<p class="basicparagraph">During his Feb. 25 message, Minister Farrakhan responded to charges of anti-Semitism that reemerged with the publication of a 2005 photo of the Minister and then-Senator Barack Obama ofÂ  Illinois.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">After howling unsuccessfully for President Obama to repudiate Min. Farrakhan again, the ADL, other paternalistic Zionist organizations and Jewish publications demanded to know why the Minister was invited to the Congressional Black Caucus legislative weekend, where the photo was taken. They polled Black lawmakers and again demanded that âFarrakhan be repudiated.â The vast majority of Black congressmen did not bow to their demands.</p>

Next came shots aimed at Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is Black and a Muslim.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Many people have come in and left the mosque, and Rep. Ellison was in the Nation in 1995, said the Minister, at the Wintrust Arena. Heâs a lawyer who wants to help his community by becoming a congressman but was pressured about closeness to Min. Farrakhan, said the beloved leader. âIâm not here to bash my brother,â he added. But the Minister said, in this world Jewish people hold the door to positions of power. âSo you will turn on your brother for some advantage in their world,â said Min. Farrakhan. âIf you want something from the White man and you have to denounce me, how will you act when your trial comes?â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Demands came Feb. 22 from CNNâs Wolf Blitzer that Rep. Ellison denounce Min. Farrakhan again. Mr. Ellison, who was chosen as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, quickly joined the anti-Farrakhan chorus. Min. Farrakhan described how Black politicians and leaders call for his help but bow to Jewish and White interests when pressured. And, he added, Rep. Ellison visited me in my hotel in 2015 as the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March was commemorated with a call for âJustice Or Else.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Jewish people have control of agencies of government and the enemy is so angry that if you like me and want something in this world, you have to denounce me or keep the relationship secret, said Min. Farrakhan.</p>

<p class="basicparagraph">Minister Farrakhan again called out his Jewish detractors to a public debate and challenged them to defeat the truth that he has consistently spoken from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad that Blacks in America fulfil prophecy and are the true children ofÂ  Israel.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Instead, the Anti-Defamation League took to social media to attack the Minister and Jewish and right wing media outlets joined the assault. Yet the 10,000 seat arena where the Minister spoke in Chicago was full, his Instagram account shows him dispensing wisdom to another generation of young people and his recently released boxed set music compilation features such artists as Snoop, Rick Ross, Common, Chaka Khan and others.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Surely these individuals would not associate with a hater.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThis is why you see this resurgence of attack, because for all that the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the media controlled by the Jews have done has not stopped the truth coming from the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan. And they have not been able to separate the divine, magnetic power that the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan has from the God and his Christ and their people, which is Black people and oppressed people throughout the world,â said Abdul Arif Muhammad, Nation of Islam general counsel.</p>

R&amp;B singer and actress Stephanie Mills exemplified this sentiment when she bowed at his feet and kissed his hands after serenading Minister Farrakhan with a rendition of âTo God Be The Glory,â before his Savioursâ Day keynote.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Ms. Mills said she has no fear, never has, and bowed to show the world her devotion to Minister Farrakhan and the valuable man that he is.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Minister Farrakhanâs helpers, followers, and supporters noted he and the NOI have withstood his enemiesâ unfounded attacks for decades with the protection of Allah (God) and his enemies know he is backed by God.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThe so-called Jews, this is what they do. This is what theyâve been doing,â said Anthony Shahid, St. Louis activist and co-founder of the Tauheed Youth Group. He also started the âHands Up Donât Shootâ chant that emerged following the killing of Mike Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âFirst of all, Iâm thankful to Allah that we have a man like him, who stands on truth. â¦ Heâs the last figure thatâs standing that they canât make him bend. And they canât break him. And they canât buy him,â Mr. Shahid told The Final Call. âThis is the only thing that they can do, but theyâve got to remember that this is not him doing this. This is what Allahâs doing. Allah chose him,â said the activist, who has known Minister Farrakhan since 1965.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âTheyâre not attacking Minister Farrakhan. Theyâre attacking us as a people. â¦ Heâs our spokesman. He stands up and speaks for us,â Mr. Shahid said.

<p class="basicparagraph" align="center"><b>Success despite Jewish onslaught</b></p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Dr. Ava Muhammad, Minister Farrakhanâs national spokesperson, a NOI student minister, and attorney, saw another aspect of the Jewish attacks and the Ministerâs continued success.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âIt is because they are losing the war between truth and falsehood, because our people, with the help of Allah and the help of Satan, are accepting the truth that Minister Farrakhan has been preaching for 62 years and the last 40 years alone, in the absence of his teacher,â said Dr. Ava Muhammad, who also hosts a radio show on WVON-AM 1690 in Chicago.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">She said the attacks and upset over the photo with Barack Obama, Black politicians and Tamika Malloryâs audience participation at Savioursâ Day are signs that his enemies recognize Minister Farrakhanâs influence.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Philadelphiaâs Jihad Ahmed, community activist and founder of the Men of Purpose Initiative said, the ADLâs attacks fall on death ears in the Black community.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âMost Black people support Min. Farrakhan because they see him as the last of the great leaders. Min. Farrakhan has been out on the front line for our community for well over 60 years,â he told The Final Call.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âWhen other leaders have sold us short, the Minister has been right there as a champion for his people. As far as him being against the Jews, I donât believe heâs against anyone. I believe heâs against those that have wronged his people.â

Minister Farrakhanâs enemies are circulating photos of him with Black politicians, one including the names of 21 Black civic leaders, purportedly Black members of Congress, who have not disavowed him.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Wilmer Leon, a political scientist, commentator, author and host of the Sirius XM Radio Show Inside the Issues told The Final Call, âMinister Farrakhan is a clear, consistent and uncompromising voice to a peopleâAfrican Americans specifically, people of color and those of good conscienceâaround the world who have been and continue to be oppressed by the forces ofÂ  White settler colonialism and neo-liberal policies.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âZionists attack him because his message contradicts their interests. Zionists turned on Rev. Jackson when he met with (Palestinian Liberation Organization) Chairman (Yasser) Arafat. We have more in common with the oppressed Palestinians than we do with their Zionist oppressors,â said Dr. Leon.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âIt was the government of Israel that backed the apartheid regime in South Africa. We have more in common with the Black South Africans than we do with Zionists.Â  Minister Farrakhan has been a clear voice in the anti-Zionist movement,â he continued.Â </p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âHistorically, the Ministerâs âdo for selfâ message of economic, religious and cultural nationalism grew out of the Black Power struggle between 1967-1970.Â  I realize that the Nation was formed before this but there was a real rise to power during this time. This was the time that the rise of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Nation grew parallel with the Black Power Movement and a strong sense of Black Nationalism,â said Dr. Leon explained.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThe Minister has grown out of that lineage and he finds himself under attack because he is one man with one voice who they cannot buy or control. If his nationalist message ever truly took hold in the African American community, it would change the power dynamic in the country and could also impact foreign policy.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">St. Louis Alderman John C. Muhammad told The Final Call, âJewishÂ groups and organizations have bashed the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan in an effort to ruin and tarnish his Godly reputation and works.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThere is an attempt to stir the masses of people away from the Minister becauseÂ he and the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah MuhammadÂ represents a whole new world that does not include oppression, falsehood, and destruction. Minister Farrakhan is the last man standing, whoÂ represents the most downtrodden andÂ oppressed people on earth,â said the young activist and political leader.Â </p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThe ADL used our hashtags in order to ride in on what they know is always trending during Savioursâ Day weekend,â said Jesse Muhammad, social media strategist for Minister Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âPeople were attacking us while the Minister was speaking because why? Farrakhan was trending in the national rankings. He was trending number one at one point and he stayed in the number five spot for over two hours. So they were cursing us out and cursing at him. They even hate to see the Ministerâs name even trending on their laptops and their smartphones,â he said.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph" align="center"><b>Challenging falsehood on Twitter</b></p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Several days after the Ministerâs address, CNN anchor Jake Tapper launched a Twitter storm Feb. 28 insisting there was reason for offense because then-Senator Obama and members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) interacted with Minister Farrakhan in 2005.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">He further compared Minister Farrakhan to racist, violent White supremacists Nazis, saying the only difference is Minister Farrakhan has a larger following, and that elected officials meet with him openly.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Minister Farrakhanâs followers responded with a barrage of actual facts about who he really is. âThe Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan is not a hater.Â  He is a lover of truth, a lover of God, a lover of his teacher and a lover of our people,â said Jesse Muhammad.

The Farrakhan Twitter Army went to work on social media, hurling truth against falsehood despite hateful, uncivil and sometimes profane words aimed at Minister Farrakhan on his social media pages as well as some of his followers. But the Ministerâs followers did not relent and the battle waged on.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">According to Jesse Muhammad, who monitors social media, Minister Farrakhanâs enemies appeared to back down. They canât deal with the invincible truth Minister Farrakhan is bringing from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and, his supporters refuse to get down in the gutter with the filth and disgruntled, Jesse Muhammad said.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">On Twitter, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the ADL, falsely charged Minister Farrakhan with a history of scapegoating Jews.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âI think itâs expected, because the Minister took the gloves off, and I think that itâs more of the same, which is propaganda, slander, criticism without critique,â said Memphis, Tenn.-based student Minister Demetric Muhammad, who is a member of the NOI Research Group.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThey have not pointed out where the Ministerâs statements are false, but they characterize his statements, labeling them as anti-Semitic. But â¦ they have never said that anything that he has said has been factually inaccurate,â Demetric Muhammad told The Final Call.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Mr. Greenblatt tweeted for U.S. Senator Cory Booker and Tamika Mallory, co-convener of the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March, and a co-chair of the Womenâs March to respond. Carmen Perez and Linda Sarsour, who also led the Womenâs March, were also attacked via social media and in the media.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Mr. Greenblatt denounced Ms. Mallory for attending Minister Farrakhanâs keynote address at the Wintrust Arena.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Ms. Mallory tweeted March 1: âI am not a slave. I am a strong black woman who will not live in fear of any man or woman. You can try to take everything I have, but only GOD can have ME.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">She, like singer Erykah Badu and others close to the Minister, was branded âanti-Semitic.âÂ </p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âThey are in the Hollywood entertainment and music industry. They know it (Jewish power) better than anybody, because theyâre in it and yet and still they chose to actively take part, which means theyâve grown beyond any fear, intimidation or concern with the consequences of taking part in this project, the consequences of this industry,â said Ava Muhammad of artists who are part of the Ministerâs recently released music project.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">When Grammy award-winning,Â musician and composer James Mtume heard about the recent attacks againstÂ Min. Farrakhan he was eager to support his longtime friend. âThose so-called Black leaders cannot be around the Minister for too long because Min. Farrakhan is like a burning torch of truth and those that donât embrace that truth will get burned by the truth,â said Mr. Mtume, who worked on the Ministerâs music project, âLetâs Change The World.â</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âWhen I was 14-years-old I went to see Elijah Muhammad with my father in 1962 in Philadelphia. Malcolm X introduced the Messenger and Elijah Muhammad said something I will never forget. He said, âItâs not what the White man does to us, itâs our fear of what he will do.â That stuck with me and thatâs the problem today with Black people. They are afraid of the White man,â he said.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âMin. Farrakhanâs character and credibility is not in question among Black people. His reputation is firmly established in the Black community and he has already secured his place in history,â said longtime radio personality Bob Law.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">âNo matter what he says or do there will always be those whom hate the truth from him and seek to attack him,â he observed. âFarrakhan at this point of his life is well beyond criticism of man. You defend yourselfÂ  by the life you live, the Minister is a proven leader. HeÂ is secure in who he is and thereâs nothing anyone can do toÂ affect him.âÂ Â </p>
