                      <p class="text"> &nbsp; <strong>Karen Joy (Thorne) Lukehart</strong>, age 81, of Rittman, Ohio formerly of Catlin, went to be with her Lord and Savior on May 17, 2024, at 12:10 p.m. at Barberton Hospital, following a period of declining health.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Karen was born on Dec. 18, 1942, in Akron, Ohio, to the late Hubert and Ellen (Neal) Thorne and graduated from Green Twp. High School. She married Donald L. Lukehart in East Liberty, Ohio on Sept. 29, 1962.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Karen was an avid reader and liked to write short stories. She enjoyed canning, gardening, sewing, going to church and playing games with her children and grandchildren, but enjoyed Scrabble above all others. She was a Sunday School teacher for many years in both Ohio and Illinois, leading many people to the Lord, and once enjoyed a missionary trip to Navajo Reservation in Colorado in 2010.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to moving to Illinois in 1983, Karen was a dedicated 4-H advisor. She had a love of the theater from her youth into adulthood where she participated in school and for several years as an adult as an actress in Christian Arts Productions when she lived in Illinois. This love and talent of the theater she passed on to her children and grandchildren.  Karen enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom but began a career at Kmart in 1982 at Wadsworth, Ohio before transferring to Danville in 1984; she then transferred to Middletown, Ohio in 1988, and Cambridge, Ohio before retiring in 1998.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Karen loved being a wife, mother and grandmother most of all. The love she held in her heart for her family and friends defined her and even in her latter days, you could sense it pouring out of her still.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; Surviving are three daughters, Pamela J. (Jim) Wolfe and Polly K. (Rob) Puckett, both of Rittman, Ohio and Suzanne M. (Greg) Woodard of Fairmount; son, Reese (Angela) Lukehart of Rittman, Ohio; one brother, Ted Thorne of Akron, Ohio; a brother-in-law, Ken (Donna) Lukehart; sisters-in-law, Erma &ldquo;Doll&rdquo; Koedel and Regina Learn; and an aunt, Betty Thorne; 14 grandchildren: Erica Henry, Anna Marie Puckett, Wesley Puckett, Michael Puckett, Luke Wolfe, Belle Levan, Cordell Wolfe, Zach Woodard, Chelsey Woodard, Kendra Woodard, Kira Lukehart, Olivia Lukehart, Claire Lukehart and Samuel Lukehart; six great-grandchildren; and many nieces, nephews, and cousins.<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; She was preceded in death by husband, Donald Leroy Lukehart; brother, Jeffy Thorne; her mother and father; two sisters-in-law; five brothers-in-law.  Services were at Auble-Gillman Funeral Home in Rittman, May 22 with niece Tarah Thorne Ray officiating. Burial will take place at the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery at a later date.<br>
                      &nbsp; &nbsp; Memorials can be made to St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105, or stjude.org.</p></td>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; Shirley McCown passed away at age 82 on April 7, 2020 at her residence in Muncie, Ind. She was born March 26, 1938 in Sidell, the daughter of Clifford and Della McDaniel.

                      <p class="text">&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Bobbee Lee (Songer) Hawkins</strong>, 72, of Catlin, Illinois passed away in hospice care at 10:12 pm on Friday, May 17, 2024, at the Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana.  At the end of her life, Bobbee was surrounded by her surviving family; husband Gregg Hawkins; son, Matthew Depratt; daughter Gracie (Brooks) Ruyle; stepdaughter Haley (Joe) Miller and stepson Jesse (Abbey) Hawkins. Also surviving Bobbee are beloved nieces, a nephew, grand-nieces and nephews and a very new great grandnephew, Killian Lee. She was the youngest of three daughters and was born on October 18, 1951, in Danville, Illinois to R.L. and Jeane Jamison Songer. They preceded her in death, as well as her much beloved sisters Maryann and Janet.  Bobbee was a member of the Catlin High School class of 1969 and attended Katharine Gibbs College in Boston, MA. She has been employed by Danville Area Community College, Carle Hospital and lastly Blue Cross Blue Shield until her retirement in 2007.  She married the love of her life and best friend, Gregg Hawkins on the white sands of Crescent Beach at Siesta Key, Florida on New Years Eve 1999.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Bobbee discovered her greatest joy in life when she became Nana. Her eight grand babies were her world and she lit up in their presence until the very end. Will Songer, Grayson Robert, Zoe Jeane, Lucille Elizabeth, Scarlett Anne, Leonard Jesse, Sutton Frances and Eloise Ann had the biggest part of her heart. She was always quick with a song or story to entertain them and rarely &ldquo;say them no&rdquo;. They are a bit more silly and sweet for having had her as Nana.  Bobbee&rsquo;s Little Free Library stands proud in her front yard and is a testament to her love of reading and books. She was a lover of all music from classical to show tunes and kept Siri on her toes with her frequent requests spanning decades. Her recall of song lyrics was impressive as was her karaoke singing voice. Much like her mother, her love language was feeding her family and once she zeroed in on your favorite recipe, she would double the batch and make it for you often. Her happiest spot in the world was Siesta Key, Florida and she had been visiting this slice of heaven for over 50 years.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Bobbee had an extraordinary gift for wit and laughter. She brightened our lives and brought joy to countless gatherings. Her ability to find humor even in challenging times was remarkable and her legacy will forever live on in the hearts of her family.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Memorial Services to honor her life will be held at 11:00 am on Thursday, May 23, 2024, at Robison Chapel, Catlin, Illinois. Visitation from 10:00 to 11:00 am on Thursday at Robison Chapel, Catlin, Illinois. Bobbee loved flowers so there are no memorials, flowers would be appreciated.
