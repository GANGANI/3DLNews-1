   <P>The Quill traveled with Derek Kindig and Kayla Rothzen (2008 graduates of West Central High School) to
   Carterville.&nbsp; They were both bowling for McKendree University at the first annual S. I. Elite
   Invite. When not attending college in Lebanon, Derek calls Oquawka home and Kayla calls Media home.
