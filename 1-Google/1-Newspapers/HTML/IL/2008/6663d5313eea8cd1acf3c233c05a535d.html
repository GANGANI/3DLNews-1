   <P>Junior football players Ryan Mowder, Dalton Johnson, Mark Mynatt, Tyler Link, and Drew Postle stand beside the equipment donated to the West Central team through the Brian Hetrick memorial. The football program purchased a JUGS football throwing machine and Porta Phone coaches' head sets.  
   <P>
Brian Hetrick was a standout football player for the Union Yankees and Monmouth Scots. Mr. Hetrick was also a highly successful and popular sprint car driver at 34 Raceways in Burlington.  
   <P>
The throwing machine is already being used by the receivers and return men this winter, and the head sets will allow the coaches to communicate with the press box on Friday nights during the season. 
   <P>
The West Central players and coaches would like to express their gratitude to Julie Hetrick and the entire Hetrick family for their generosity and support.
