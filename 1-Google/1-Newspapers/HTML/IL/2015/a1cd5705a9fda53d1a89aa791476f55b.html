ATLANTA (FinalCall.com) - Deconstructing the lies of this worldâs religious and educational systems, the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan demonstrated both are rooted in White supremacy with Black people in particular and the darker people of the world in general, as the victims.</p>
<p>His first stop was the Interdenominational Theological Center for a discussion with students of religion.</p>
<p>Using prophetic scriptures and real life examples, Min. Farrakhan proved much of what has been taught from rostrums by religious authorities in the so-called houses of God, and from lecterns in academic institutions was taught to confine and limit, not prepare students for future rulership. The Minister regularly speaks at churches, so it was clear he felt right at home with his Christian family.</p>
<p>âGod says in the scriptures he is not the author of confusion, but of peace. How did we get so confused?â Min. Farrakhan asked. âSatan has entered in among the people of God and divided the house of worshippers of the one God and made some of us enemies of others, because we misunderstood the messages of our prophets, wise men, women, and sages whom God has always sent among the people,â he added.</p>
<p>Minister Farrakhan commended the work of the ITCâs administration in showing they were âunafraid of censure from Satanâs followersâ by inviting him to speak there. This is the time for the people of God to stand strong, he said.</p>

âWe really have to be definitive today as to who is with God, who is with his Christ and who are the followers of Satan masquerading as Christians or Muslims or Jews or agnostics? Satan has followers!â the Minister stated emphatically. âSatan is such a master deceiver he can transform himself into an angel of light and those of us who walk in darkness might think weâre in the presence of God.â</p>
<p>Slavery cannot be ignored when dealing with the plight of Black people, especially when dealing with religious scripture, which he reminded listeners, was in fact used by unscrupulous businessmen to justify racism and âthe peculiar institutionâ of chattel slavery. Slave traders grabbed the most skilled and advanced Black people to use their bodies to grow their wealth.</p>
<p>âThose who discovered the new landâwith people already hereâneeded the strong backs of an ancient people to help them build a new world reality,â said Min. Farrakhan. âThey brought people who were the architects of the original civilization of human beings,â he added.</p>
<p>Black people with a great legacy as ancient builders have been reduced to non-productive beggars. Black people are now âMade in Americaâ by the enemy of God and now Black people are the enemies of themselves.</p>

Even with all the political officials, highly paid entertainers and doctorate degrees, Blacks are still in mental slavery that prevents them from making the great progress they have the potential to make. Min. Farrakhan said his job is to speak truth to power to give others the courage to stand up to those who have misused, abused, tormented and oppressed people all over the planet.</p>

âI have outlived those who were afraid to speak and I will outlive my enemies and see them buried in the hell that they have deserved!â said the Minister as the crowd stood to their feet and cheered.</p>
<p>The Minister said although he often speaks about world affairs, since he was speaking to religious students he wanted to deal specifically with the subject of religion.</p>
<p>âI want to talk about Jesus Christ,â said the Minister. âIâm talking to people who love Christ, but need to become closer to him,â he added.</p>
<p>Most in the theological seminaries of the world, referred to by the Minister as âtheological cemeteriesâ lack a true understanding of Jesus, which is why despite the fact that Christianity has spread all over the world, the world is still in need of guidance to escape this time of global trouble.Â </p>
<p>âThey didnât put Jesus in you, they buried him! Because if they had put Jesus in usâIâm talking about the real Jesus and the real Christianityâyou wouldnât be as silly, weak and powerless as you are today!â he said.</p>
<p>He told preachers to âstop being surface dwellers and surfboarding through religionâ commanding them to dig deeply into the richness of religious scriptures because churches, mosques, and synagogues need to be revived. He also said young preachers should not strive to build big churches, but instead, find a way to produce better people. To those who question why as a Muslim he would speak so much about Jesus, Christians and biblical scriptures, he answered forthrightly.</p>
<p>âIâm not the regular imam,â said Min. Farrakhan. âIâm a servant of the Lord of the Worlds and what I teach has no denomination. Iâm not here to make you into something that you are not.â</p>
<p>He said the older generation of pastors are âpharaohâs magiciansâ and have been compromised, which is why they are the first ones called and asked to calm down youth who are angry that police are regularly shooting down unarmed Blacks without any retribution.

Min. Farrakhan then took questions that came in and were curated by Amber Lowe and Richard WilliamsÂ  of the ITC. Questions were also submitted via Min. Farrakhanâs official Facebook page. He answered questions about the role of women in Islam, and defeating Islamophobia. One question was about the formation of a unified body to confront police violence brutality and racist mob attacks.</p>
<p>âLet the police continue to do what theyâre doing and itâll be very easy for us to mobilize Christians and Muslims,â said the Minister. Then, sounding a theme that has been consistent since his Savioursâ Day 2015 message, he emphasized the scriptures will be fulfilled as wrongdoers will now reap what they have sown, and âas thou has done, so shall it be done unto thee.â</p>
<p>âGod is angry! God has come to avenge his people!â said the Minister.</p>
<p>Leon F. Parker III, president of the Student Christian League of the ITC, said he welcomed the opportunity to bring Min. Farrakhan to what he called âthe epicenter of Black liberation theologyâ for such a timely message.</p>
<p>âI thought his comments were very prophetic,â said Mr. Parker. âThe importance of dialogue between Muslims and Christiansâinterfaith conversationsâare essential for the betterment of our kindâthe Black Americans, Black men and Black women,â he added.</p>
<p>Wanjiku Kamuyu is from Nairobi, Kenya, where over 140 Christian students were recently killed in an attack attributed to Al-Shabaab. She is enrolled at ITC to pursue her Masters of Divinity degree with concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling. She found the Ministerâs words related to cooperation between Muslims and Christians to be especially comforting.</p>
<p>âThe Ministerâs words today were powerful, empowering, uplifting and they gave me a sense to do better work,â said Ms. Kamuyu. âIt was beautiful to hear him speak on issues dealing with my country and it would be awesome if he went there to speak to the people,â she added.

<b>A message to the young and gifted </b></p>
<p>Later that day, the Minister spoke to another group of students, but this group was a bit younger in age. He was speaking to high school youth and college aged students at Muhammad Mosque No. 15, the Southern Regional headquarters of the Nation of Islam.</p>

Students from Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Georgia State University, Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia in Athens, and Tuskegee University were all represented.Â  Many of them were brought by charter bus so they could see and hear the Minister for themselves live and in person. For many, they had only seen pictures of him via Instagram or Twitter from postings showing him with their favorite musical entertainers.</p>
<p>Although the skies were cloudy, the rain held off until the main sanctuary and an overflow room where those in attendance could see and hear via video hookup was filled to capacity. The Minister smiled approvingly as he looked at their young faces. He also commended young brother Rasheed Ali, 19,Â  whom he called âa future giant.â As a freshman from Boston, Rasheed came on the campus and would not stop until the Minister was able to speak to students.</p>

âI am so honored that you came,â Min. Farrakhan said. âAs a man 82 years of age, not knowing how much time I have left, you are the most important people in my life right now. Because you will be here when I am gone, and I want to make sure that you have the requisite knowledge that will see you through a dark day into the light of a brand new day and a brand new world,â said the Minister.</p>
<p>âIâve been taught by a master who is making me a master,â he told the students.</p>
<p>The Minister said many youth like to refer to themselves as the âJoshua Generationâ related to the biblical prophecy that Joshua would be the one to lead the Children of Israel into the Promised Land. He said it depends on whether they are going forward in their activism with the same spirit of those who followed Joshua into the Promised Land, according to the scriptures.</p>
<p>âYou could be that, but you are not now,â said the Minister. âThe Joshua generation, they are not integrationists.â They are to be a generation of warriors, he noted.</p>

Knowing that many had likely heard of Malcolm X, the Minister masterfully presented a brief history of his interaction with the Black liberation icon, whom he loved and learned much from. The Minister even forthrightly dealt with Malcolmâs disagreement and public clashes with the eternal leader of the Nation of Islam, the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Malcolmâs work with Black people, at the direction of the Hon. Elijah Muhammad had such an impact, Malcolm X is still bringing people into consciousness and the Nation of Islam even now, some 50 years after his death, the Minister said.</p>
<p>He also talked to youth about how the face of Jesus as a White man was spread throughout the entire world, in order to conceal his true identity and subsequently, the true identity of those who would fulfill the prophecy of the Chosen People.</p>
<p>He advised the youth not to spend their college years smoking, drinking, partying, and having sex, but to pick a major with an eye on the future.</p>
<p>âChoose a profession that lends itself to nation-building,â he told them.</p>
<p><b>Students respond</b></p>
<p>With the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March coming up in October, many students were looking forward to not only hearing what the Minister had to say, but to assist in organizing.</p>
<p>âThis was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I am grateful to have my part in it,â said Will Chandler, Morehouse College SGA vice-president.</p>
<p>Vaughn Arterberry, 19, and a Morehouse College freshman had seen videos of the Minister speaking on YouTube but never in person. Although he has not yet decided what his major would be, Min. Farrakhanâs words put a lot on his mind.

<p>âThatâs the most moved Iâve ever been by a speaker live and in person before. It was amazing. I was speechless. I never lost focus, never got bored, and took copious notes. Heâs the best person Iâve ever heard speak live,â said Mr. Arterberry. âThe fact that Morehouse allowed him to come speak in 1979 for the graduation and here in 2015 denied him because of politics, we were disappointed in our institution because of that,â he added.</p>
<p>Senior History major and Clark Atlanta University SGA president Faron Manuel said he was glad to have had the chance to bring Min. Farrakhan to speak to the âleaders of tomorrowâ and called him a very sincere person and one with solutions to the problems Blacks face in this country.</p>
<p>âIt was a trying time to put all of this together, we went through a lot of hurdles and hoops but a lot of students wanted Minister Farrakhan to come to speak to us,â said Mr. Manuel. âI noticed he did everything with absolute sincerity. This is a man who is dedicated and has made his lifeâs work the betterment of his people and improvement of the conditions of Black people in this country who are at the top in the most negative statistics. We need the help the most, and this is a man who has decided to dedicate his life to this mission,â he added.</p>
<p>Fifteen year old Ahmad Muhammad attends Atlantaâs Maynard Jackson High School. He said Min. Farrakhanâs words to the youth were âbrilliant.â</p>

âThe fact that he is talking about the younger generation coming together and building our own, like an empire almostâand that we need to work on the very first professions like farming,â Ahmad continued, âIâm going to do what he wants us to do. Iâm going to stay focused and Iâm going to work on my farming and practice so I can become the master of it,â he added.</p>
<p>Safiyah Abdul-Ali, 17, listened carefully the entire time and what stood out to her were the Ministerâs words on hormones and chemicals in food and water.Â </p>
<p>âIt made me think about a lot of things like how some things can cause chemical reactions in your body and change the way you think,â she added.</p>
<p>âIt was on time,â said 17-year-old Anisah Muhammad. âI really enjoyed it because he really spoke to the students and he appealed to the students and most religious teachers they donât really care about the younger generation they just care about the older generation. They think weâre like savages out there on the street not doing anything. So I really liked that he spoke to the students and he answered their questions,â she said.</p>
