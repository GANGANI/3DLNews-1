	debut</p>
	</b>
	<p>By Louise Watt</p>
	<p>The Associated Press</p>
	<p>BEIJING  Differing Chinese and western expectations over marriage 
	provided the inspiration for Zhang Mos directorial debut, <i>Suddenly 
	Seventeen</i>, which she says is about encouraging young women to &quot;explore a 
	little further&quot; before they settle down.</p>
	<p>The daughter of Chinese cinematic great Zhang Yimou, Zhang said returning 
	to China after years of study in the United States felt like &quot;a reverse 
	culture shock.&quot; Then 26 and viewing a life full of possibilities, Zhang was 
	startled people thought she should already be married and planning a family.
	</p>
	<p>&quot;Women in the west, by the age of 28 ... they still feel like theyre 
	young, they still want to pursue their career maybe, and (find) out who they 
	are, but in China its almost like the opposite,&quot; said Zhang, now 33 and 
	married to an American who works for the Hollywood agency representing her.
	</p>
	<i>
	<p>Suddenly Seventeen </i>is based on a novel published on the internet. 
	Its part of a hugely popular genre among young Chinese that focuses mainly 
	on fantasy and romance tales and has spawned movies and web series. </p>
	<p>In Zhangs film, the 28-year-old protagonist, Liang Xia, played by Ni Ni, 
	is unhappy in love and eats a magical chocolate that wipes her memory and 
	turns her back into a 17-year-old. Zhang says she seized on the short 
	novels premise and characters, but rather than keeping Liang at 17, her 
	heroine flips back and forth in age every five hours, creating conflict and 
	drama.</p>
	<p>After moving to the U.S. at age 15, Zhang studied architecture at 
	university but felt stifled by an internship at a New York firm. &quot;Everyone 
	was in a box ... because they dont want to steal each others ideas,&quot; she 
	said. &quot;For me, I still want to connect with people, I still want to express 
	emotions, so I decided maybe architecture wasnt the best choice for me.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>After studying filmmaking at New York Universitys Tisch School of the 
	Arts, she returned to China to work as an editor on four of her fathers 
	films, including <i>The Flowers of War</i> starring Christian Bale.</p>
	<p>&quot;Its really a privilege, because editings really the best way to learn 
	how to become a director,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;Whatever he shot I saw, and I made 
	that into a story, and so through that process you really learn how to cut 
	the movie, how to tell the story, or even how to shoot the film to make it 
	great.&quot; </p>
	<p>Emerging as part of the Chinese post-Cultural Revolution avant-garde, 
	Zhang Yimou gained international acclaim in the 1980s for art films such as
	<i>Red Sorghum</i> before turning to more commercial fare. His first 
	English-language movie, <i>The Great Wall</i> starring Matt Damon, comes out 
	next year. </p>
	<p>Being the offspring of a famous director isnt always an advantage, Zhang 
	Mo says. </p>
	<p>&quot;People immediately (think) you must have way more resources, and you can 
	have way more shortcuts, but actually its not true. If anything its the 
	opposite because the family aspect casts such a big shadow, you have to be 
	extra creative, or working extra hard, to gain the audiences approval.&quot; </p>
	<p>Despite basing her directorial debut on an internet novel, Zhang says 
	that movie genre may have already peaked, with audiences now looking for 
	fresher and more personal stories rather than something that has amassed a 
	huge online fan base. </p>
	<p>&quot;I think original content right now is the key for the future of Chinese 
	filmmaking, to tout original stories, not something (remade), not some 
	internet novel,&quot; she said.</p>
	<i>
	<p>Suddenly Seventeen</i>, whose Chinese title translates as &quot;28-year-old 
	Minor,&quot; was widely released in China last month and given a limited release 
	in cinemas in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand on December 
	2. In addition, it was also released in South Korea, Thailand, and other 
	Asian countries.</p>
