								</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">More than money or equipment, people are always the most important asset an organization can have; without them, you have nothing, but with them, everything else will follow.<br>
								<br>
								For one organization, this is apparent in more ways than one.<br>
								<br>
								Founded 19 years ago, the Northwest Catholic Counseling Center began with a simple goal: to provide much needed counseling to the local community. The center was founded using the pooled resources of five Northeast Portland Catholic churches.<br>
								<br>
								Three part-time counselors were hired to begin operating the center. Two were invited to Portland from Nebraska practices, Sister Barbara Kennedy and Sister Sarah Deeby. Both are licensed professional counselors.<br>
								<br>
								Six years into existence, the center moved to its current location and acquired the status of a nonprofit organization. As of 2005, the number of counselors is up to seven, with five full time. This year, the center&#146;s name changed to the Northwest Catholic Counseling Center from its former Northeast Catholic Counseling Center.<br>
								<br>
								&#148;The name change is far more reflective of the population that we serve,&#148; said Kennedy, who is director of the center.<br>
								<br>
								Where once clients came only from the Northeast Portland area, they now come from all over Portland, as well as Clackamas County and Vancouver, Wash.<br>
								<br>
								Much has changed in the nearly two decades the counseling center has been in operation. However, the center&#146;s goal has remained the same, and Kennedy and Deeby still practice there today.<br>
								<br>
								The Northwest Catholic Counseling Center is simply about counseling, for individuals, couples and families. Clients come in with problems that range from life-threatening mental health issues to the happy problem of preparing for marriage. Fifty-five percent of clients are not Catholic, 40 percent are not insured and 17 percent are unemployed. Anyone who needs counseling services is welcomed regardless of faith or philosophy, counseling needs or financial status. This is one of the most important messages that Kennedy wanted to get across.<br>
								<br>
								She noted with evident disappointment that very few from the minority community currently take advantage of the center&#146;s services and she is determined to see this change.<br>
								<br>
								The determination to reach out to everyone in the community and to meet the needs of each client in any way possible is probably the very reason that everyone at the center seems to love their work so much. Clients working with these counselors must get a clear sense of welcome and compassion.<br>
								<br>
								One young mother felt so strongly in support of the center and its purpose that she agreed to speak at a recent fundraising event for the center in October. She and her son, whose names are omitted here to protect their privacy, have benefited from the center&#146;s services and from donations to the center. The family had suffered tragic losses, including three suicides within two years. The last suicide was the young woman&#146;s mother, with whom her son, just six years old, was exceptionally close. This normally happy and loving child slid into depression.<br>
								<br>
								&#147;I choked back the tears as I thought of my son falling victim to the darkness that shattered my family and my world,&#148; said the mother.<br>
								<br>
								The family was referred to Deeby, who focuses on counseling of families and children. The boy and Deeby bonded quickly and worked together for over six months.<br>
								<br>
								&#147;With Sister Sarah&#146;s help, and the financial help I received from the Northwest Catholic Counseling Center, my son was able to receive the treatment he so desperately needed,&#148; said the mother.<br>
								<br>
								The young boy did recover and even made an appearance at the fundraising event, once again a lively and healthy child.<br>
								<br>
								This child is one example of the more than 700 clients in the last year who have received help from the counseling center.<br>
								<br>
								Talk with any one of the counselors or office staff and you get an immediate sense of support for each client and each other. Melissa Nelson is the office manager and likely the first person a client meets. Nelson&#146;s warm smile and twinkling eyes make you feel at ease right away.<br>
								<br>
								Between talking with clients on their way out and counselors on their way in, Nelson shared how hard all counselors work at the center. She says that on any given day, you will find at least one of them working late into the night. This is the driving reason that scheduling is so flexible at the center.<br>
								<br>
								&#147;It really is about the people that you help,&#148; said Nelson, describing why she came to work at the counseling center.<br>
								<br>
								Counselors Michelle Sandri and Eric Roux were drawn to the center for the much the same reasons. Both are easygoing and very approachable, and the newer additions to the center. Sandri works mostly with adult women and adolescents; Roux works with individuals and couples.<br>
								<br>
								&#147;I really like the staff,&#148; said Sandri, only three months at the center, &#147;and the support of the staff for each other.&#148;<br>
								<br>
								&#147;This is probably the best, most supportive and close-knit team I&#146;ve ever worked with anywhere,&#148; said Roux, who has been with the counseling center for over two years.<br>
								<br>
								Licensed Professional Counselors Sister Lisa Sheridan and Shirley Price echo the same sentiments. They have been with the center for many years.<br>
								<br>
								Knowing that there are caring and supportive people inside the counseling enter is important for a client, but it is also reassuring that the counseling center receives support from the outside, too. Most clients have insurance or are able to pay their fee, but the fees of more than a third of clients are either subsidized or almost entirely waived. All of this good will is thanks to corporate and private donations and grants.<br>
								<br>
								Development Director Patricia Trout works hard every day to make sure the donations keep coming in. In addition to researching and writing grant proposals throughout the year, she devoted five months to planning the fundraising event in October.<br>
								<br>
								From the beginning, it has been the people that have made the counseling center a success. Almost all clients learn about the center through word of mouth or by referral from their insurance company, nearly a third from friends alone. It is the hope of the NWCC staff that people keep talking, just a bit more often and to many more people. The counseling center is located at 8383 N.E. Sandy Blvd., Suite 205.
