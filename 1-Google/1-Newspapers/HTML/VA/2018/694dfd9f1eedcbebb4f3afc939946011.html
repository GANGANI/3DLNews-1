<p><strong>Gold Medal of Valor Recipients</strong></p>

<p>Fairfax County’s Urban Search & Rescue team, Virginia Task Force 1 is awarded the Gold Medal of Valor. In the effort to save lives and alleviate suffering, Fairfax County’s Urban Search & Rescue team, Virginia Task Force 1 was deployed to San Juan, Puerto Rico which had sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Irma only days prior to the arrival of Hurricane Maria. Upon arrival, the team immediately established a base of operations and conducted search and rescue operations in the Virgin Islands. While conducting lifesaving and humanitarian aid missions in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria formed as a Category 5 hurricane taking direct aim at San Juan. Even with the threat of the oncoming hurricane, the team continued their search and rescue operations on the Virgin Islands without thought of their own personal well-being. The team endured the assault of Hurricane Maria for 24 hours only to continue the search and rescue after the storm had passed. The members of VATF-1 acted without regard to their personal safety under extremely hazardous conditions. They demonstrated courage, dedication, and determination.</p>
