<p class="text"><a name="101"></a>Inclusive Democracy and State Reformation "Urgent" to Bring 
  Dalits into Mainstream Nepal </p>
<p class="text2"><b>D.B. 'Sagar' Bishwakarma</b> <br>
  Dalit Rights Activist & National President, Dalit NGO Federation, Nepal, November 
  20, 2005<br>
  <br>
  <b>General Situation of Nepal: </b><br>
  <br>
  Inclusive democracy and human rights are the basic tenets of the Dalit movement 
  in Nepal and these are major socio-political processes for the eradication of 
  caste as well as other forms of discrimination in contemporary Nepali society. 
  Dalit movements in Nepal have always been in favor of inclusive democracy and 
  state reformation as part of a process to ensure and promote equality, justice, 
  freedom and the sovereignty of people. Human rights and an inclusive democracy 
  are essential for Nepal to manage conflict, socio-economic and political stability 
  and progress. Without these absolute commitments, the state will not be accountable, 
  responsible or transparent to anyone. <br>
  Unfortunately, there has been no democracy, accountable government, human rights, 
  freedom, or civil liberty in Nepal, especially after the royal coup on February 
  1, 2005. Democracy and human rights in Nepal are in a serious crisis following 
  that royal takeover of power. There are now no guarantees of right to life, 
  security, or dignity for the people of Nepal and this has hit Dalits, women 
  and other disadvantaged groups particularly hard. <br>
  The crisis in Nepal is, however, not new. It has been emerging as a result of 
  growing inequality, social and religious fragmentation on the basis of caste, 
  ethnicity, language, religion and gender since the beginning of this royal regime 
  in Nepal, over 200 years ago. That rule has attempted to unite many small principalities, 
  many language and ethnic groups, and multiple religions through assimilation 
  and/or exclusion into the caste and legal system of the rulers based on Hindu 
  religion in Nepal as well as South Asia more widely. None of these forces, then, 
  is new in Nepal although they have been mounting and, finally, the outside world 
  is beginning to look behind Nepal's spectacular scenery to observe its deep 
  social inequalities. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Caste Discrimination in Nepal: </b><br>
  <br>
  Around 4.5 million Dalits in Nepal are placed at the bottom of society and the 
  state as they are considered ritually 'impure' and 'untouchable'. On this ground, 
  the rest of society often leaves behind Dalits, not only in the socio-cultural 
  and political realms, but also in the economic pace. Though banned by the civil 
  code (Muluki Ain) since the early 1960s, 'untouchability' is still prevalent 
  in the Nepali society. According to the UNDP Human Development Report-04 of 
  Nepal, Dalits are far behind other castes from the same vicinity on a wide range 
  of measures. The situation of Dalit women is further vulnerable on the basis 
  of caste, gender and economic situation. <br>
  Similarly, the Madhesi (or Indian-origin) Dalits are also marginalized by both 
  caste and nationality from the mainstream development process. According to 
  research study done by Dr. Bhattachan (scholar), Dalits suffer from over 200 
  different kinds of discrimination based on caste, occupation and descent in 
  Nepal. According to DNF and other Dalit organization sources as well, there 
  were some 3654 cases of atrocities against Dalits last year. Due to these high 
  levels of fragmentation and economic deprivation, Dalits have been suffering 
  from poverty, illiteracy and lack of access to basic humanitarian services in 
  Nepal, resulting in high infant mortality and low life expectancy. <br>
  The movement against this outdated caste-based discrimination towards Dalits, 
  which unjustly denies them a dignified life, should be looked upon not only 
  from Nepal's national perspective but from a global perspective as well. Caste-based 
  discrimination is one of the most widespread social maladies of human civilization 
  throughout history and should not be tolerated in the 21st century. The United 
  Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emphasize elimination of all forms 
  of discrimination but there are also loopholes regarding caste issue and Dalits 
  who are the poorest and most victimized people in the world. <br>
  In Nepal, the 9th Plan and 10th Plan or Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PRSP) 
  -- prepared by the National Planning Commission of the democratic government 
  of Nepal (HMG/N) with support from Dalit organizations and multi/bilateral agencies 
  e.g. UK's Department for the International Development (DFID), World Bank (WB) 
  -- also stress the inclusion of Dalits, women, and ethnic/minorities in the 
  mainstream Nepali society. The attention given to Dalits and ethnic minorities 
  in this plan and other policies of the democratic government of Nepal is encouraging, 
  but their implementation is lacking. This is undoubtedly due to many reasons 
  e.g. an inefficient, non-sensitive governance system and lack of proper representation 
  of Dalits in both policy and implementation levels. The so-called 'high caste' 
  groups that control society, the state, and economy have not shown any sufficiently 
  strong political will to deal with it firmly. Since they are the dominant groups 
  not only in many local communities, but also in the civil service and educational 
  system throughout Nepal, their indifference (if not outright opposition) has 
  produced inefficient non-caste-sensitive governance. <br>
  Another important issue is that the ongoing conflict in Nepal has, for the last 
  10 years, developed into a crisis for the state as a whole and for Dalits, women 
  and other disadvantaged and ethnic groups in particular. During the conflict 
  between the Maoists and the security forces, many innocent people, particularly 
  Dalits, women and ethnic groups, have become more vulnerable than others. For 
  the 80% of Dalits, women and other ethnic minority groups, the long-term conflict 
  and current insurgency have worsened their plight significantly. One of the 
  factors of the existing insurgency in Nepal is based on economic deprivation 
  and class division. Very large numbers of Dalit families (around 27 thousand 
  families according to Media and Dalit organizations) have been internally displaced 
  from their homes and villages. Most of them have gone to India or nearest urban 
  areas and some of them have gone to Arab countries for employment and security. 
  Because of this displacement, they are unable to claim or receive even the most 
  basic and essential humanitarian needs such as, medicine, clean water, shelter 
  and clothing. Their children can no longer go to school and the adults are insecure 
  and unable to find employment or an opportunity to earn their own livelihood 
  in other ways. <br>
  The state's policies have, in some cases, been directly responsible for the 
  economic deprivation of Dalits, ethnic groups and women, such as through the 
  caste-biased legal codes and education system. In other cases, widespread practiceswithout 
  any legal basissuch as discrimination in employment, access to credit, social 
  relationships, constant threat of community reprisals, have severely disadvantaged 
  Dalits. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Dalits, Inclusive democracy and State reformation: </b><br>
  <br>
  Through my work as a Dalit rights activist and, especially, my work within the 
  Dalit Federation of Nepal, I see some trends emerging. Overall, the discriminatory 
  state policies and socio-economic practices, ironically, hasten the emergence 
  and widespread acceptance of common or collective identity e.g. as Dalits, as 
  ethnic/indigenous people, as women, or as Madhesis ( Nepali people of Indian 
  origin). As Nepal's current situation worsens their socio-economical conditions 
  and frustrates their political aspirations, these emerging collective identifications 
  may push people in either of the two directions -- some may be pushed towards 
  dynamic insurgency within various caste groups, especially the so-called higher 
  caste vs. lower caste or Dalits, ruler vs. ethnic or Hindu vs. non-Hindu groups. 
  Others may turn toward promoting the causes of human dignity, liberty, and inclusive 
  democracy. We have painfully experienced that "caste or Dalit issue" has been 
  used by the ruler class as a political tool, as a "vote bank" to secure their 
  ruling position. <br>
  I would like to propose the following major agendas on behalf of the Dalit National 
  Federation to end discrimination against Dalits--deriving as it does from the 
  interplay of caste, religion, ethnicity, gender, education and occupationand 
  promoting socio-political inclusion, social justice and human rights: <br>
  <br>
  1. Eliminate "untouchability" and all forms of discriminations. <br>
  2. Declare the state as secular. <br>
  3. Ensure proportional representation, affirmative action policies and reservation 
  for Dalits and other disadvantages groups. <br>
  4. Ensure citizenship, land rights, and freedom to use all public places. <br>
  5. Encourage, protect an inter-caste marriage and intermixed relationships. 
  <br>
  6. Settle issues of Internally Displace Dalits (IDD) due to caste, conflict, 
  inter-caste marriage and displacement from traditional occupations. <br>
  7. Declare Dalits as major beneficiaries of PRSP and MDGs programs and implement 
  Card System. <br>
  8. Implement a non-discriminatory education system and immediately stop discriminatory 
  education textbooks/syllabus from schools and universities. <br>
  9. Establish a "constitutional mechanism" to monitor, direct national and international 
  policies to eradicate caste and all forms of discriminations. <br>
  10. Push for adoption and implementation of the "Kathmandu Dalit Declaration 
  (KDD)" by the UN, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and multilateral, bilateral, 
  National non-governmental organizations /governments, civil society and political 
  parties. (See attached file of KDD) <br>
  11. Initiate the establishment of the international mechanism (International 
  Commission for Dalit Rights-ICDR) to monitor caste-based atrocities, poverty 
  eradication, social justice and the democratic process and policy advocacy and 
  research on Dalit rights in the contemporary world. <br>
  <br>
  The lack of Dalit presence in the previous Nepali constitutional engineering 
  process contributed to its many loopholes and discriminatory articles. Our past 
  sad experience shows that, when major beneficiaries are not included in the 
  policy engineering process, the chances to ensure that their issues or agendas 
  are addressed is less. To mainstream Dalits into the national socio-economic 
  and political processes, it is urgent that we establish an inclusive democracy 
  and reform the state. We also strongly opposed the new media act launched by 
  the autocratic government. This media act directly affects the Dalit rights 
  movement and their socio-political process in Nepal. <br>
  It is the position of the Dalit NGO Federation and overall Nepali Dalit movement 
  that a constituent assembly is needed to support a democratic process that would 
  ensure Dalits their rights, dignity, freedom, and equal representation as well 
  as transform the current conflict into a stable political and socio-economic 
  development process for peace and democracy in Nepal. <br>

<p class="text"><a name="100"></a>Who is hitting the nail on the head? </p>
<p class="text2"><b>By Mitra Bandhu Poudel</b><br>
  Deventer, The Netherlands, November 10, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Nepal hit the headlines with the announcement of parliamentary election and 
  the controversial new ordinance aimed at curbing the press. The ordinance has 
  brought many contradictions in constitutional provisions related to media. Similarly, 
  another question has been raised -is it a proper time to announce the date of 
  parliamentary election? Definitely not. Perhaps the king thought it was the 
  right decision for the country and its people. One thing is to be noted that 
  "a right decision at the wrong time becomes a wrong decision" (shiva Khera: 
  You Can Win: pp5). It is not only an irrelevant exercise of power by the king 
  but also an attempt to sideline the existence of major political parties. The 
  king's enthusiasm to rule the country with absolute power has only put democracy 
  in jeopardy.<br>
  It is clear that the intention of the new ordinance is to muzzle press freedom 
  in Nepal. What exactly is in the new ordinance? Prominent Journalist Yubaraj 
  Ghimire writes in the Indian Express, "The fine for publishing 'banned' items 
  has been increased ten fold to Rs 1 lakh (Approximately US $ 1500) and that 
  for publishing, translating and importing items aiding 'terrorists' has now 
  been made Rs 5 lakh from the earlier Rs 50,000. The ordinance also puts curbs 
  on the publishing of news items that bring the king or his kin hatred or disrespect. 
  The check earlier had dealt only with news against the king." He further adds 
  that there are provisions to ban FM stations from broadcasting news and also 
  restrict a person from owning two media outlets.<br>
  Hundreds of journalists are going to face redundancy due to this new ordinance. 
  So, the government's claim that it is helping professional journalism through 
  this is- meaningless. No wonder journalists have condemned this black ordinance 
  and they may take up a desperate struggle against it.<br>
  International and diplomatic reactions have been very negative. India also has 
  criticized the newly introduced press ordinance. According to New <a href="http://www.kerala.com" target="new">Kerala.com</a>, 
  External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said, "Curbs on the freedom 
  of expression and media, which is a fundamental pillar of democracy, will inevitably 
  be counter-productive." <br>
  Similarly, British ambassador to Nepal, Keith G. Bloomfield said, "The new media 
  ordinance introduced by the Nepali government is a threat to democracy"<br>
  It is surprising that the king does not understand the displeasure of various 
  organizations -- national and international -- towards his latest move, obloquy 
  has come promptly from every corners of the world.<br>
  Back to the issue of parliamentary elections -- we can get a general idea by 
  looking at what happened in 2002. One thing to be noted is that in October 2002, 
  the then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba asked the king to put off elections 
  by a year due to Maoist violence. The king dismissed Deuba terming him "incompetent" 
  and put off elections set for November. Consequently, Lokendra Bahadur Chand 
  was appointed as the new premier. Chand resigned in May 2003 and Surya Bahadur 
  Thapa was appointed as the new prime minister in June. Due to the intense street 
  protests by opposition groups, Thapa also resigned. In June 2004, sacked former 
  prime minister Deuba was reinstated.<br>
  It is 2005, and still the gravity of the problem is not being addressed. As 
  far as the Maoist problem is concerned, if the then prime minister Sher Bahadur 
  Deuba had addressed the Maoist 40 points in 1995, he could have easily nipped 
  the problem in the bud. But, it didn't happen and eventually it has become the 
  most difficult problem to tackle.<br>
  It is apparent that the palace has not sincerely done an assessment regarding 
  this matter. The king wants to regain credibility especially from the international 
  community, showing them how desperate he is to hand power over to the elected 
  government. The king should stop looking through colored glasses because the 
  reality is entirely different from what he sees. If the election happens forcibly, 
  you will see bloodbaths. The country cannot take it any more. It's a shame the 
  royal government could not welcome the Maoists' 3 month ceasefire either. People 
  seem only to have a choice between anarchy and vindictiveness. It is quite simple 
  that the former is the one that destroys law and order and the latter takes 
  revengeful action. And, that's what Nepali politics have come down to the serious 
  question - Who actually wants to make Nepal a belligerent nation? If the palace 
  does not seize the opportunity to restore peace, the monarch will definitely 
  miss the bus.<br>
  Many intellectuals are saying that election is impossible without first resolving 
  the present political dispute. Former chief justice of the Supreme Court, Bishwa 
  Nath Upadhyay, said, "Chairman of the council of ministers is not a legitimate 
  authority to declare polls or conduct elections if we are to follow the word 
  and spirit of the constitution."<br>
  Although the issue of national reconciliation has been raised through many Forums, 
  ultimately it's been stymied by the palace because the king has been bearing 
  down on all political parties since he took over absolute power.<br>
  The ongoing talks between the Maoists and the political parties will definitely 
  influence the upcoming political scenario of Nepal. The government should not 
  play unhealthy tricks on this by misusing the media. How does the country overcome 
  the crisis? First, the king should sincerely take a conciliatory approach towards 
  solving all the current problems with the assistance of the seven agitating 
  political parties. Secondly, political parties should reconcile with the palace 
  and reassure its rights and duties within a democracy. Thirdly, political parties 
  should not restrict restoration of the dissolved House of Representatives. It 
  is rather irrelevant in the present situation. Nepali Congress President GP 
  Koirala's voice is nothing more than that of someone crying over spilt milk 
  in this issue. Fourthly, the King should stop converting the state-run media 
  outlets into sycophants .As a matter of fact, it is suffering a series of setbacks 
  already. Fifth, the royal government should stop blowing its own trumpet in 
  matters regarding conflict resolution and finally, three parties (king, political 
  parties and Maoists) should apologize to Nepali people for their past defects. 
  Apparantly, these three parties are too stubborn to admit that they were wrong.

<p class="text"><a name="99"></a>End of Monarchy is the need of Nepal</p>
<p class="text2">Nepalipost Report<br>
  From London, Nov 6, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Student leader Gagan Thapa has said that the end of monarchy, which has exploited 
  the nation for centuries, is the solution to the present day problems of Nepal. 
  <br>
  Speaking at an interaction organized by Nepalese Peoples' Coordination Committee, 
  United Kingdom (NPCC, UK) in Wembley, London recently, he said establishment 
  of full-fledged democracy without the king, can be the meeting point for all 
  political forces of Nepal. <br>
  The king himself has time and again broken the agreement with the political 
  parties and suppressed the peoples' aspiration for change, Thapa said. "Therefore, 
  there is no possibility of an agreement with the king to resolve the present 
  problem even on adhoc basis." <br>
  The old identity has crumbled and we the youths have united for drastic change 
  in the state affairs via social, economic, political and cultural revolution, 
  Thapa said. <br>
  We have to struggle inside the parties to make changes to accommodate the feelings 
  of all people of all sectors and ethnic communities to ensure democracy in real 
  practice, he added. <br>
  Dr. Ramesh Dhungel said the republic system is inevitable in Nepal if the king 
  does not like to be completely constitutional in real sense without playing 
  any role in state affairs. <br>
  Dr. Sampurnand Dhungana said drastic political change is necessary in the country 
  at a time when the king has not changed himself and that the palace has never 
  listened to the voice of the people. <br>
  Prof. Surya Subedi said the present problem is due to the king's action of February 
  1, which was unconstitutional. The king must be a constitutional monarch like 
  in the United Kingdom and the constitution should be reformed to reflect the 
  aspirations of all, he said. <br>
  Chairman of NPCCUK Purushottam Paudel stressed the need of unity in all sectors 
  at a time when the country is moving towards a republic system for full-fledged 
  democracy. The country is being run by more than two dozen ordinances issued 
  in the absence of parliament, which is completely unconstitutional, he said. 
  <br>
  He also condemned the attack on Kantipur FM and the recently promulgated media 
  ordinance brought to control freedom of the press in Nepal. "Election without 
  the participation of political parties is totally unconstitutional and will 
  not be acceptable," he said. <br>
  Coordinator of Solidarity Nepal Krishna Upadhyaya, and a host of speakers including 
  Karna Bahadur Shahi, Surendra Shrestha, Dinesh Ghimire, Sumit Sharma stressed 
  the need of full-fledged democracy in Nepal. A large number of Nepalese living 
  in London and other parts of the UK attended the program. </p>

  <br>
  </b>104-year long autocratic Rana regime ended in 2007 BS, after the peoples' 
  movement and tri-partite agreement between Indian Government, Nepal Royal Palace 
  and Rana regime. Some form of a multiparty democracy was adopted in the country 
  their after.<br>
  To show a pro-people facade, King Tribhuvan put forward a slogan of republic 
  Nepal during earlier few years of his arrival in power. Slowly he moved to autocratic 
  line and even a Constitutional Assembly was not acceptable for him in later 
  dates when he himself established well.<br>
  Mahendra who was a radical rightist became king in 2012 BS. He was successful 
  to conspire against Nepali Congress Party (the most popular party after 2012 
  BS and who had formed a government after the general election of 2015 BS). He 
  was successful to invade the Nepali Congress (NC) secretly from the beginning 
  of his rule.<br>
  As the King Mahendra's conspiracy was successful, he overthrew the democratically 
  elected majority government of NC in 2017 BS. Later on, his conspiracy was also 
  successful to invade the second popular party of the country (Nepal Communist 
  Party). His new development models, reforms in the administration and successful 
  conspiracy on two major political parties were very helpful to establish and 
  continue the autocratic Panchayat regime for 30 years (2017 - 2046 BS).<br>
  Growing awareness among people, failure of the government to fulfil the aspiration 
  for social, economic and equitable development of the country, corrupt and very 
  inefficient bureaucratic system, united agitation of the political parties etc. 
  led to overthrow the autocratic Panchayat regime. King Birendra's loyal-ness 
  to the people might also have contributed to some extent to re-instate the multiparty 
  democracy in 2046 BS without much bloodshed.<br>
  Nepalese people got the multiparty democracy second time in 2046 BS. The King 
  Birendra agreed to be constitutional Monarch, and some democratic processes 
  initiated in the country after when the constitution of Nepal, 2047 was enforced. 
  However, nobody cared for the democracy of the ordinary people and the democracy 
  was enjoyed by those who were in power and position including the Palace. Nobody 
  bothered to institutionalize the democratic processes, norms and values at personal, 
  household and at organizational levels (either GO, NGOs or political parties 
  or their sister organizations) through formal and informal education and behavioral 
  changes. On the other hand, the limited fundamental rights available to the 
  people were also not acceptable to the ultra-rightist fraction of the Palace. 
  As a result, the ultra-autocratic fraction came into power in June 2001 after 
  the massacre of whole family members of the king Birendra.<br>
  This Palace is ruthlessly clever in adopting the principle of &quot;divide and 
  rule&quot;. The present King Gyanendra was not satisfied with the constitution 
  from the beginning though the constitution of Nepal, 2047 has given him abundant 
  of the rights (more than required for a constitutional Monarch) and privileges. 
  That might be the reason that the new Palace started to encroach the constitution 
  slowly after successfully sorting-out the issues of Royal Massacre.<br>
  There are numerous instances that the Palace has been encroached the constitution 
  seriously. The encroachment is focused mainly to seize people's power leading 
  to form the Palace puppet government with a big setback to the major political 
  parties and to the democratic processes in the country. The Palace has now prepared 
  sufficient background where it will be possible to form a puppet government 
  under the name of multiparty democracy.<br>
  The Palace (Rana and Shah) has never become the part of constitutional forces 
  in the constitutional history of Nepal. Despite this fact, still there is strong 
  illusion (bhram) to some Nepalese elites that Palace is the strong constitutional 
  force. Let us not waste time and realize the fact that the present regime of 
  Nepal will never be a constitutional force. That is evident from the political 
  history of Nepal. Rather it would be easier that CPN (Maoist) could be a constitutional 
  force in this country. For this, people friendly constitution need to be developed 
  from the joint action of all major political forces. Maoist should also join 
  the united force. It is also the responsibility of major political parties and 
  Civil Society to help the CPN (Maoist) to transform them as a constitutional 
  force of the country. Therefore, let us, sooner the better, unite all constitutional 
  forces to defeat the enemy of peoples' democratic republic of Nepal.<br>
  <br>
  <b>2. Steps taken by the Royal Regime to Form a Highly Autocratic System<br>
  <br>
  </b>All educated Nepali people with no any vested interest know well what the 
  current regime is doing for their own democracy, and what the regime is doing 
  to abduct the democratic rights of the people. Let us see what the Royal Regime 
  (the Palace) has done so far in this regard. Only main points are given below:<br>
  <br>
  &middot; Unconstitutional positions created in the Cabinet i.e. the position 
  of Chairman and Vice Chairman,<br>
  &middot; Unconstitutional procedure introduced to nominate the ministers in 
  the Cabinet. Moreover, it is very unconstitutional to become King as head of 
  the Cabinet (the Prime Minister),<br>
  &middot; Mostly either corrupt and criminals or persons rejected and/or marginalized 
  from Political Parties have been inducted/nominated as ministers,<br>
  &middot; Unconstitutional institutions formed at central level for example, 
  Royal Commission for Corruption Control,<br>
  &middot; District Monitoring Committees have been formed for political purpose 
  in all 75 districts, <br>
  &middot; Unconstitutional Regional and Zonal Administrators appointed with the 
  sinister motive of channelizing and controlling the administrative set up by 
  the Palace. <br>
  &middot; The government headed by the Palace has nominated the members of District 
  Development Committee (DDC) including the Chairman and Vice-chairman in all 
  75 districts. All nominees are the blind supporter of the Palace,<br>
  &middot; The Palace and/or the government has been stimulating directly for 
  the formation and networking of journalists for their support outside the gamut 
  of Nepal Federation of Journalists (NFJ),<br>
  &middot; Direct intervention of Palace in Civil Service System. More importantly 
  frequent transfer and/or termination of job of senior administrators such as 
  Secretary, CDO, and Chief Justice of the districts.<br>
  &middot; Ordinance of various kinds including Media and I/NGO Ordinances formed 
  recently and undemocratic processes adopted to enforce the ordinance.<br>
  <br>
  In a nut sell, the total political and administrative systems of the country 
  have been grabbed by the Palace and they are trying very hard to grab the media. 
  Major political parties have been marginalized and issues raised by the powerful 
  insurgent party (CPN Maoist) have not been addressed. In such context, how can 
  a free and fair election be expected???<br>
  <br>
  <b>3. What should be done to get rid of this problem?</b><br>
  <br>
  There may be different ways to overcome the current crisis of Nepal. Only boycotting 
  the forthcoming election does not give the way out to the current crisis. Therefore, 
  following actions may need to be taken:<br>
  <br>
  3.1 Strongly boycott the forthcoming elections: </p>
<p class="text2">It needs rigorous interactions and consensus among all likeminded stakeholders. 
  Specific and concrete steps should be initiated as early as possible.<br>
  <br>
  3.2 Form a common forum i.e. Forum for People's Republic Nepal followed by the 
  formation of a true government from all agitating political parties<br>
  <br>
  &middot; Change the image of the parties by confessing with people pointing 
  out the specific mistakes made in the past and commit for no more such wrong 
  doings in future,<br>
  &middot; Form a high level committee at different levels (at district, zonal, 
  regional and national level) and negotiate with CPN (Maoist),<br>
  &middot; Massive campaign (within the country and abroad) to request all donor 
  agencies for not to support the current autocratic regime in any form,<br>
  &middot; Massive campaign to block or withdraw the payment of taxes to this 
  regime; the campaign could be through the mass media, public speech, workshops, 
  interaction meetings etc.<br>
  &middot; Form a true government at various levels by making representation of 
  all agitating political parties and civil societies,<br>
  &middot; Start collecting taxes to operate the parallel government,<br>
  &middot; Establish relations and deal with neighboring and friendship countries 
  as true government of Nepal through formal and informal diplomatic relations, 
  <br>
  &middot; Try all possible means to manage support from local donor agencies,<br>
  &middot; Establish relations with international institutions, mainly UN organizations 
  as the true government of Nepal. Request the UN to return back the RNA from 
  the Peace Keeping Force. This should be applied until when the RNA does not 
  come under the command of Parliament of Nepal and that RNA has been misused 
  by the Palace to be repressive and anti-people,<br>
  &middot; Include Maoist representatives in the true government at various levels,<br>
  &middot; Initiate meaningful dialogues with the army and try convincing that 
  they should be loyal to the tax paying people and their representatives rather 
  than anti-people Palace that does not pay any taxes for them,<br>
  &middot; The parallel government should ask their relatives, friends and their 
  well wishers to resign from RNA,<br>
  &middot; Prepare specific and a detailed plan for the Constitutional Assembly 
  as the true government of the country and organise the Constitutional Assembly,<br>
  &middot; Develop an armed-force by the parallel government if the regime still 
  exists or show resistance to change. This armed force may be unified with Maoist 
  armed force later on, if things are settled properly.</p>

<p class="text2">Nepalipost Report<br>
  PORTLAND, USA, November 05, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Advocate Dinesh Tripathi was invited to speak as an international guest on the 
  convention of National Lawyers Guild (Oct 27-31, 2005) held in Portland, USA. 
  On the occasion Mr. Tripathi highlighted about the massive and systematic human 
  rights violations taking place in Nepal. He said that, &quot; there is total 
  disrespect for rule of law and constitutional provision. King acted against 
  the constitution and imposed his personal and direct rule in the country.&quot;<br>
  He informed the participants that the judicial independence and authority of 
  judicial branch of the state has been seriously undermined and large numbers 
  of court orders were utterly disrespected by the Royal regime. Court system, 
  though still functioning, is under the shadow of growing militarization. Ruthless 
  and undemocratic measures are being used to suppress democratic will and aspirations 
  of the people. There is ongoing and relentless attack against the courageous 
  Nepali press. Black media ordinance was recently introduced to intensify the 
  attack against media and the mid-night raid of Kantipur Radio Station shows 
  the extent of government hooliganism.<br>
  Addressing the gathering he informed that at this most critical and difficult 
  juncture, Nepal needs full attention and an active support and involvement from 
  the international community. Violation of human rights is a legitimate concern 
  of global community. But unfortunately Nepal is not getting as much international 
  attention as the situation demands. International civil society and global human 
  rights community must support actively the human rights movement and democratic 
  struggle of Nepal, because violation of human rights and norms of democracy 
  in one country is the threat for everywhere in the world.<br>
  Founded in 1937, the National Lawyers Guild is an association of American lawyers 
  committed for rule of law and civil rights. Around 600 hundred participant including 
  lawyers, law professors and legal academics participated in the convention from 
  across America. Guest from Japan, Philippines and Belgium also spoke on the 
  occasion. Guild also agreed to organize international fact-finding mission and 
  delegation to Nepal.</p>


<p class="text"><a name="96"></a>Workshop on Opportunities and Challenges for Nepali Political Parties</p>
<p class="text2">Washington, D.C., October 30, 2005<br>
  <br>
  A workshop on Opportunities and Challenges for Nepali Political Parties was 
  conducted in Washington, D.C by Liberal Democracy Nepal (LDN) on October 22-23, 
  2005. The representatives of six political parties (Nepali Congress, Communist 
  Party of Nepal UML, Nepali congress  Democratic, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, 
  Jana Morcha Nepal, Nepal Sadbhavana Party (A)), who were on a visit to the USA, 
  were invited for a face to face interaction on the present political crisis 
  in Nepal. A prominent Nepali human rights activist Mr. Padma Ratna Tuladhar 
  was also in attendance.<br>
  The Workshop consisted of four moderated thematic sessions -- dealing with monarchy 
  and Royal Nepal Army; dealing with the Maoists; managing the movement for democracy; 
  and political parties managing themselves.<br>
  Several aspects of the themes above, including the restructuring of the state, 
  social justice, and an inclusive party polity, were deliberated in depth by 
  the delegates, LDN moderators and participants.<br>
  In addition, Baltimore America Nepali Association (BANA) organized a town hall 
  meeting on Oct 22 to allow the local community to have an open forum with the 
  delegates. Several dozen people participated in the forum. The political leaders 
  from Nepal gave their perspectives on the country's current political condition. 
  The presentations were followed by a lively question and answer session between 
  the delegates and town hall meeting attendees.<br>
  The main conclusions/recommendations of the Washington D. C. workshop were as 
  follows  1) concerted efforts are needed to protect human rights and civil 
  liberties in Nepal; 2) there should be immediate restoration of multi-party 
  democracy in Nepal, and full support for the ongoing peoples' movement for democracy; 
  3) national sovereignty should rest fully with the people of Nepal; 4) sovereign 
  people should themselves decide the role of monarchy; 5) the CPN (Maoists) should 
  commit to lay down arms and pledge unconditional commitment to multi-party democracy, 
  and pluralism, and respect for human rights; 6) the political parties should 
  commit themselves to full internal democracy, inclusive people-centered politics 
  and healthy democratic practices; 7) a negotiated settlement is necessary to 
  end the current conflict; 8) and, all possible support should be extended towards 
  bringing the three protagonists to a peaceful resolution to the current conflict. 
  <br>
  The representatives from Nepal included Dr. Ram. S. Mahat, Chakra Bastola, Jhala 
  Nath Khanal, Pari Thapa, Ashok Rai, Dr. Minendra Rijal, Bilmalendra Nidhi, Anil 
  Jha, Dhruba Pradhan, and Padma Ratna Tuladhar.<br>
  The participating members of Nepal Diaspora included several members of LDN, 
  friends of LDN, community leaders and invited participants form the Washington 
  Metropolitan area.<br>
  In addition, a panel on the UN's possible role in solving Nepal's crisis was 
  also organized. Assistant Secretary-General of the U.N. and UNICEF Deputy Executive 
  Director Kul C. Gautam and the U.N's conflict expert Samuel Tamrat were guest 
  speakers at this event. </p>


<p class="text"><a name="95"></a>Empty Rhetoric of Good Governance</p>
<p class="text2"><b>Krishna Prasad Adhikari </b><br>
  Reading, UK, October 12, 2005<br>
  <br>
  King Gyanendra has repeatedly promised more than anyone else to deliver good 
  governance and alleged the party-led post-1990 regimes of failing to deliver 
  it. However, the unfolding activities of the royal government for the past eight 
  months have shown that it is one of the worst governed regimes.<br>
  It is a well-accepted fact that a system of good governance requires wider participation 
  of the people through elected representatives in order to enact and enforce 
  laws. Given that the king systematically orchestrated to destroy the popularly 
  elected House of Representatives and made the upper house virtually defunct, 
  the lawmaking and enforcing system in Nepal is dictatorial. The country is derailed 
  from the constitutional courses with a series of laws being promulgated through 
  royal ordinances. Whatever the king brings out through ordinances becomes law 
  of land without subject to rectification through people's representatives. He 
  is doing so to serve self-interest, which is vehemently being opposed by the 
  political parties and civil society institutions.<br>
  Seen from the perspectives of absence of corrupt and unethical behaviours for 
  good governance, this government has the worst record ever. It is an open secret 
  that most of the members of the present cabinet have one thing in common: unethical 
  past or present. Some are bank defaulters, while some others are alleged smugglers. 
  Some of them have even spent jail sentences for alleged attempted murders, while 
  others have corruption cases pending at the court. Many fresh evidences of unethical 
  behaviours of powerful members of the cabinet are coming up. Most recently, 
  the first vice president of the council of ministers was known to be a blacklisted, 
  wilful bank-defaulter. Moreover, even though the official declaration of his 
  property shows that he owns only 10 tola gold as his private property, he managed 
  to pay approx. Rs. 20 million loan back to a bank through a foreigner. Furthermore, 
  recently a team of senior ministers were allegedly attempting to earn millions 
  of black money overnight by masterminding a cross-border smuggling of subsidised 
  fertilizer. Neither has there been any word on refutation nor an action. <br>
  Furthermore, in a militarised autocratic regime, rulers attempt to deny people's 
  rights to information and communication and very little is known about high-level 
  corruption. However, it is needless to dig deep to find evidences that the king 
  himself is no better than any other corrupt in terms of amassing money for his 
  expenditure. In the king's regime, there is neither any requirement nor any 
  institution to regulate him from having as many taxpayers' money as he would 
  judge necessary for royal pleasure. Surprisingly, in a war-torn and poverty-stricken 
  country like ours, the king's budget has ballooned to an unprecedented size. 
  It has jumped from Rs. 64.16 million in 1996/97 to Rs. 355 million this year. 
  Furthermore, after the king's February 1st takeover alone, the royal foreign 
  visit has cost taxpayers over Rs. 200 million. Take another example -- In contrast 
  to the nearly Rs. 6 Million expenditure of a delegation to the United Nations 
  General Assembly led by an elected prime minister in 2002, allocation for the 
  king's proposed visit this year was Rs 102 million. Thanks to cancellation of 
  his visit, it saved a huge amount of taxpayers' money from going to waste. These 
  examples show a mismatch between the extravagant royal requirements and the 
  nation's ability to afford them. Can such luxuries be ethically justified as 
  not being white corruption in wider senses? <br>
  The present regime stands with a premise that the system of service delivery 
  can be improved and made efficient with the centralised structures of administration 
  in place. The government has gone ahead in this line restoring the old, dumped, 
  infamous autocratic institutions like Anchaladhis, and handpicking Regional 
  Administrators as the institutional pillars to sustain the present regime. The 
  civil service sector is already terrified with the recent incidence of manhandling 
  senior civil servants by the power-obsessed, royal-nominated administrators. 
  The king and his deputies enjoy self-assigned unprecedented power to judge and 
  dictate the grassroots administration and development in an attempt to establish 
  an administrators-centric upward accountability structure. In fact, it is antithetical 
  to the principle of a devolved system of local governance in which people are 
  the master of their destiny. Can denying people the opportunity to champion 
  the cause of their development help achieve good governance? <br>
  Militarisation is in rapid rise. There is barely anything left for essential 
  social development since taxpayers' money has been diverted to fund the rapid 
  militarisation process. Army is not confined in the battlefield today; its jurisdiction 
  has been extended in such a way that it censors media and controls news. Most 
  powerful royal advisors and country's ambassadors are the ex-generals. The government's 
  failure to reciprocate ceasefire offered by the Maoists is guided by the military 
  mind of a prolonging war. Naturally, the militarisation is inversely related 
  to the roles of people's representatives and civil society institutions as the 
  actors of a national governance system. Will the process of pulling the army 
  into civil affairs by pushing people's representatives aside lead to good governance? 
  <br>
  This government lacks decency and fairness. It has undermined the constitutional 
  institutions like CIAA and failed to respect the judicial system. The extra-constitutional 
  institution, RCCC, which is vested with unlimited power to investigate, charge 
  and convict, is systematically pursuing political vendetta. Rights violations 
  by state forces with impunity have been the order of the day of the present 
  regime. <br>
  In sum, a centralised, militarised, un-transparent and autocratic government 
  of never-elected gang dominated by the past or present bank-defaulters, party-defectors, 
  smugglers and alleged criminals neither has shown any sign of delivering good 
  governance nor can it be expected to do so. This is further evident in the fact 
  that those who wanted to give the present government a chance are becoming disillusioned 
  as the February 4th promises have appeared to be mere hypocrisy. Furthermore, 
  as the ultra-rightist mandale activities in the past eight months have shown 
  a worsening situation, the rhetoric of good governance has proved a deception 
  to sustain the bogus regime. </p>


<p class="text"><a name="94"></a>The exploded Head</p>
<p class="text2">By <b>Janata Bahadur Nepali</b><br>
  14 September 2005<br>
  <br>
  Things that do not happen anywhere can happen in Nepal. Probably, that is why 
  this country is known as Shangri-La. Just as the myth and the mystery of the 
  Yetis of the Shangri-La; a mysterious royal tsunami occurred on 1 June 2001, 
  which swept away 10s of the royal heads. The Kathmanduers once again witnessed 
  another mysterious scene in the mid of the 2000s. On that day, one human head 
  was exploded by itself. &quot;How?&quot; people whispered to each other.<br>
  The experienced doctors tried to find out, actually, how this particular head 
  exploded, but they could not find any clue. However, one of the head specialists 
  hinted that the head contained strange debris, composed of things such as; politics, 
  smuggling, massacre, jealousy, greediness, etc. which had been packed down in 
  that head since the 1950s.<br>
  As per the suggestion of the head expert, one investigation team was formed. 
  The team included a Mathematician, Political Scientist, Economist, International 
  Relation Expert, Criminologist, Psychologist, and a Natural Scientist. They 
  collected the pieces of the exploded head in a plastic-bag and took them to 
  one of the science-labs in Kathmandu. The analysis followed right away.<br>
  It was the Mathematician, who first began his analysis. He turned the pieces 
  of the brain with tweezers, and started his analysis. He said, &quot;From very 
  childhood, this head used to play with the equation-formula of the algebra.&quot;<br>
  &quot;That's right. This head did many-many political equations,&quot; agreed 
  the Political Scientist.<br>
  The Political Scientist turned the pieces of the exploded head around, tapping 
  his nose with a napkin. After gauging into the pieces of the brain, he said, 
  &quot;This head's political equations were like the following:<br>
  NC + RPP - CPN-UML = Way to Coup (for abbreviations, see 'What is what' below). 
  <br>
  CPN-UML + RPP - NC = Way to Coup.<br>
  Maoist + Crook Politicians - Honest Democrats = Way to Coup.<br>
  The Political Scientist continued, &quot;In the early 2000s, when the Maoist 
  rebels were gaining popularity, this head went to the jungle and diverted the 
  Maoists' Shining-path aka Prachanda-path towards the Taliban-path. Soon, the 
  Maoists' popularity went downhill.&quot;<br>
  According to the Political Scientist, this head made the following equations 
  of the leaders too. <br>
  Bamdev Up + Madhav Down = CPN-UML's split.<br>
  Army + Deuba - Girija = Collapse of the Parliament and the Split of NC.<br>
  State of Emergency + The West + 2-October-2002-Coup = Political Parties in the 
  Streets. <br>
  Executive Power to Himself + Chand + Deuba + Maoist - Political Parties = Chaos. 
  <br>
  Army + Deuba + CPN-UML - Other Political Parties = 1 February 2005 Coup.<br>
  Army + Prachanda - Baburam = People's War Down. <br>
  The political scientist further explained, &quot;In this head's equations, the 
  feeble leaders readily stayed between his + and - signs. As a master of plotting, 
  this head knew it very well that when and who should be pushed up, and when 
  they should be pressed down. The Sadhus of the Pashupati temple area, living 
  together with the monkeys, were his co-plotters.&quot;<br>
  Now, it was the Economist's turn to analyze the head. He said, &quot;This head 
  did many trading equations too. Cigarette manufacturing cum hotel operations 
  + antique sculpture cum marijuana smuggling out + gold and luxury goods smuggling 
  in = billions of dollars in his secrete bank account in Switzerland.&quot;<br>
  In fact, this head did even worse thing to fill in his pocket. The crook Army 
  Generals + foreign hints = Bhatata (royal palace massacre). Bhatata + the royal 
  palace and the property capture = also capture of Pamphadevi (late Queen)'s 
  secrete bank account in Switzerland.<br>
  &quot;Wait, wait!&quot; the Political Scientist interrupted. &quot;His motives 
  were not only to capture the property of his late brother and his family, but 
  also to take hold of the crown. His formula was like this: capture of the Narayanhiti 
  Riyal Palace + the crown + a daydream to be a living Hindu god Vishnu = wipe 
  out of his brother's entire family. <br>
  The next turn to analyze the head was of the International Relation Expert. 
  He said, &quot;As it was not possible to run his poverty laden country without 
  donations, the right equation of the foreign support was important too. He tried 
  this equation: China + Pakistan + India - Kalapani (west Nepal territory occupied 
  by India) - Nepal's water resources to India = Long Live Autocracy. Although 
  China and Pakistan said yes to him, India played Ping-pong with him. Here, his 
  equation got a disorder. He turned to the other side and tried: War on Terrorism 
  + USA + UK = Long Live Autocracy formula. But Nepal neither has oil, nor is 
  a haven for the Al-Quaida. The USA and the UK did not have much worry for the 
  Maoists, who were nearly eradicated from the world long ago. So, they said no.&quot; 
  <br>
  Then, the Criminologist took his turn to examine the head. &quot;Although this 
  head used the Maoists in his previous equations, they no longer listen to him, 
  as they had become powerful with looted guns and forcefully recruited guerrillas. 
  The title of the 'World's Hindu King' that he put on him by himself, fell apart 
  elsewhere. He wanted to be worshiped as a living Hindu God Vishnu, but the people 
  cursed him as a sculpture thief instead.&quot;<br>
  The Criminologist had got a lot more to say about his analysis. He continued:<br>
  The memory of the bloody history on the one hand, and the growing revolution 
  on the other; this head slowly lost its control. Whether in the dreams or in 
  the reality, he saw only the blood, corpses, bullets and explosives; and he 
  heard the demonstrators' chanting slogans calling him a murderer and a thief. 
  He could hardly sleep. When he eventually fell asleep, he woke up with nightmares. 
  In his half-conscious state of mind, he sometimes announced for tender notice 
  to apply for the post of Prime Minister, and sometimes he forgot to appoint 
  one at all. He did not trust anyone. He was frightened with his own shadow. 
  Later, he handpicked some of his Here criminal partners, and formed a cabinet. 
  He tried to run the country, but reached nowhere. Some Western diplomats questioned 
  whether he was a leader of the criminals.<br>
  An 18th century French style revolution was arriving to his doorsteps. In case 
  he survived, he was sure that he would be taken to the International Criminal 
  Court, where he had to tell about every single crime that he committed. Just 
  as the fleas leave a dog, when it is dead; many of his supporters began to leave 
  him. Those, who were able to flee the country, they did so; while the others 
  either went underground, or joined the republicans.<br>
  Under the plot of this head, thousands of Nepalis died, and millions became 
  homeless. Nobody knew, how many people disappeared from the prisons; how many 
  of the children became orphans; and how many of the women were raped and brutally 
  killed afterwards. Thousands of the policemen and the soldiers lost their lives. 
  A handful Military Generals and Police Inspectors, who had their own opinions, 
  were shot dead, and the guilt was put on the Maoists. Now the curtain dropped. 
  The police and the military realized who carried out those massacres. An emergency 
  meeting of the police and the army soon followed, which decided to support the 
  republican revolutionaries. The meeting concluded, to protect the right of survival 
  of the 24 million Nepalis, this head must be shot. The head's own bodyguards, 
  then, prepared to load their guns. There was no possibility to apply his ultimate 
  formula: the army's help + to flee Nepal = to join the former dictators in France. 
  His equation turned upside-down, like this, and consequently this head exploded 
  by itself. <br>
  &quot;Wow! What a terrible story!&quot; said the investigators with long sighs, 
  and at once, they clapped their hands.<br>
  Why did this head act like a mad monkey his whole of life? The Psychologist 
  had the answer. He said, &quot;In 1950, this head was accidentally crowned due 
  to an odd political situation. However, soon the crown was returned to his grandfather; 
  and then it was transferred to his father; and later to his oldest brother. 
  This head got mad and plunged into deep thoughts; how could the crown be returned 
  to him. Because of his childhood trauma, he became a psychopath. He could not 
  see the difference between human being and mosquito, when it came to killing. 
  To forget his problems, he began drinking raxi (alcohol). He also smoked cigars 
  and marijuana. Thus, he became an alcoholic and a chain-smoker. When the alcohol, 
  tobacco, marijuana, and the flashback of his conspiracy, smuggling, brutality, 
  massacre, as well as the failed equations whisked together in this head, it 
  was exploded.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Your analysis has brought the relation between psychology and natural 
  science together,&quot; said the Natural Scientist. &quot;Maybe, we should advise 
  this head's family to establish a 'Bhatata Peace Prize' just as the 'Nobel Peace 
  Prize' established as tribute to those killed by the Nobel dynamites.&quot;<br>
  Meanwhile, the local radio broadcasted, &quot;The head of the wife and the son 
  of this exploded head also burst, when they were preparing to flee the country. 
  The daughter-in-law of the exploded head instantly fainted. She later woke up, 
  when the servants poured a bucket of cold water on her. She, then, horridly 
  announced: I hereby state publicly to return all properties, looted by this 
  family since the centuries, to the people of Nepal. I will rather support my 
  children and myself by opening a momo hut (Nepali fast food) in the street. 
  However, may I humbly request, not to hand over the properties to the newer 
  versions of Pamphadevis and Bhatatas, but to the clean leaders of the civil 
  society? Because we should not plant the seeds of another revolution, as we 
  did in the aftermath of 1990's revolution, where all former totalitarians were 
  excused by the democratically elected government.&quot;<br>
  Enormous happiness flooded over the nation. A new national anthem echoed in 
  the mountain ravines and through the flat terrains, as well as in the cities 
  of the Shangri-La, &quot;Democratic Republic of Nepal! Finally; beautiful, peaceful 
  and just great&#133;&quot;<br>
  What is what?<br>
  Baburam: One of the key leaders of the armed Maoist Party<br>

  <br>
  " I had to pay $8000 dollars to get a house cleaning job in the United States", 
  said Sushil---a 24 year old Nepali , who works in an internet café making $30.00 
  a month to support his wife, two kids and his parents. He wants to go to America 
  to make enough money so he can start his own business when he returns. <br>
  He, like thousands of other young Nepalis have completely lost faith in their 
  country. They see that their only option is to get work abroad. Besides --there 
  are very few jobs available in Nepal - even for college graduates.<br>
  I inquired if Sushil would get his $8000 back if he didn't receive a visa. He 
  never asked. He feared that if he pushed the agency too much they would reject 
  him. He didn't know if the place was licensed either. He read about it in the 
  local newspaper . They guaranteed a job in the United States .The process : 
  You pay an agency to find you a job in another country, then you are qualified 
  to apply for a visa. <br>
  Since I was interested in helping Nepalis with this process, I volunteered to 
  call the agency. They connected me with the head huncho. I asked if they were 
  licensed. Immediately the man suggested that I work directly with his American 
  counterpart. He gave me their name, web-site and phone #--and got off quickly.<br>
  We checked out the website and we're especially pleased that you could apply 
  on-line and the total fee was $1300 .Not bad !! We wondered though--how did 
  it get to be $8000 ? That doesn't include a $1500 airfaire and a $200. non-refundable 
  fee for the visa interviw at the US embassy. The average income of a Nepalese 
  is $250 a year. So, my friends decided to go for it. Why pay $8000? Before they 
  took this step , I had a friend in the US call the Agency-- to check them out.<br>
  The response: a man's voice said, "Leave a message." The company's name was 
  never mentioned . Calls were never returned. All alittle irregular for a legitimate 
  company. Finally, after days of calling, a live voice . My friend was told that 
  the Nepalis had to pay the $8000. <br>
  Immediately, I informed those who had already paid half the fee --to hold off 
  until we finished our investigation. Ironically, even though there was doubt 
  --they were willing to pay the whole fee. They were desperate. Most of them 
  got this money thru loans at very high interest rates. They wanted a chance 
  in another country --even if it took years to cut even and make alittle profit. 
  <br>
  The plot thickens: I called the US Embassy and asked what they thought .They 
  guessed that both the American and Nepali agencies cut a deal --and split the 
  cash. There's no way it costs $8000 to find a house cleaning job. This was almost 
  all profit. Later I discovered that this was cheap in comparison. A young women's 
  family paid $ 18,000 to get a job cleaning a beauty salon in New York City. 
  Also, even if they got a signed contract that their money would be returned 
  if they didn't get a visa-- these contracts virtually mean nothing. We checked 
  this all out with the US Dept. of Justice. Apparently, it isn't discrimination.<br>
  The poor are taken advantage of --not only by their own wealthy countrymen, 
  but also by the developed nations.. This is but a tiny example of a practice 
  that is ocurring on a grand scale. A recent report on REAL AID states that in 
  2003 the total aid flow of 69 billion dollars is far short of what donors had 
  pledged. In fact, they barely gave 10% of what they committed. In the same year, 
  poor countries transferred 95 billion dollars to developed countries as interest 
  payments on their loans. Lastly, when George Bush created a 15 billion dollar 
  AIDS Treatment Fund---a hugh portion of that went to paying for expensive brand 
  drugs that the US pharmaceutical companies produce, but cannot compete with 
  the other cheaper --but equally effective drugs on the market.<br>
  These events tell us about who we are: Have we lost our souls to profit? Is 
  justice merely a bleeding heart's reaction? Is business simply to just find 
  a market of the disadvantaged --and milk 'em dry? Has greed become the spiritual 
  disease of our times? <br>
  We need to remember that the world is ONE Family--we need each other !!. We 
  can , indeed , find meaning in helping one another--without a string attached.

<p class="text"><a name="92"></a>Rerservation For Women Not the Answer </p>
<p class="text2"><b>By Bashu Dev Phulara</b> <br>
  September 02, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Nepal is now plagued with many problems -- debt, disease, conflict, corruption 
  and weak governance. It is pragmatically seen as an unusual place in the reservation 
  system as well. This matters to everyone, therefore. Though reservation mania 
  has found new pastures, how many deprived Nepalese have benefited from this 
  type of compensatory discrimination may never be known. In fact, reservations 
  for Dalits, reservation for disadvantaged groups and reservation for women have 
  all one thing in common. In view of that, it sounds very good to discuss whether 
  or not reservation for Nepalese women is to the point. <br>
  <br>
  <b>RESERVATION MANIA </b><br>
  <br>
  The concept of reservation is one in the chain of romantic ideologies churned 
  out in the aftermath of Hegelianism. Some might argue that reservation for the 
  women has gone too far. But, it was never intended to continue forever. The 
  whole foundation of the reservation argument is that the entire community benefits 
  from it. <br>
  There is the feminist argument in its favor. In essence, it runs thus: Nepalese 
  women are a deprived group. Their status will not improve unless their depiction 
  in decision-making sector reflects their numerical strength in society. This 
  seems fine. But, there are more immediate problems. By nearly every parameter, 
  there are several other groups in this country that are at least as worse off 
  as women. Reservation is not the appropriate answer, therefore. <br>
  The protagonists of reservation seldom offer an explanation, "We're talking 
  about gender, not religion," they declare, although the laws of logic will crumble 
  in the face of feminist indignation. The problem with reservation is that it 
  is based on a number of unsubstantiated premises that simply do not make sense. 
  <br>
  Many advocates urge that only members of one group can help others in that group. 
  And then, the only way to improve the Nepalese women's lot is to put other women 
  in power. This is nonsense. In advanced societies where women have made huge 
  strides - such as the United States and the United Kingdom- the proportion of 
  women in decision-making sector is sometimes even smaller than in South East 
  Asia, including Nepal. <br>
  Women, for example, dominated South Asian politics, particularly in India, for 
  over a decade. It is not clear how Indian women gained much more from Indira 
  Gandhi than they did from, say Jawaharlal Nehru, or how powerful female politicians 
  like Sheikh Hashina of Bangladesh, Chandrika Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka and alike 
  have helped to improve women of their own countries. <br>
  It is obvious that an insightful political activist/leader of any country helps 
  every sector of his/ her country, whether h/she is Hindu or Muslim, man or woman 
  and rich or poor. The problem with reservation is that it wishes to institutionalize 
  this failure. Hence, this very reality would be a great tutorial to all of us. 
  <br>
  In Nepal, reservation has been an instrument of the politicians to win the votes 
  of women and other weaker sections of society. The politicians, notably those 
  in power, have exploited the issue of reservation to feather their own nests. 
  The real beneficiaries of this system are not the needy but the politicians 
  and their henchmen. <br>
  A small number of women in politics and other levels have reached where they 
  are because they are the wives or widows or daughters or daughters-in-law of 
  politicians or others with clout, and not because of their own achievements 
  or beliefs. The truth is that Nepalese politicians or leaders do not support 
  reservation for women. If they did, there would have been many more female leaders/activists 
  and officials without a single seat having to be reserved for them. <br>
  Women are the strongest weapon that any group can possess in a democracy: the 
  advantage of numbers. The voices of Nepalese women, however, have already fallen 
  on deaf ears. All the same, the proposed reservation mantra could do nothing 
  to maintain the gender balance. Despite some pragmatic results, it has completely 
  failed to deliver the promised gains either. <br>
  Why do women need reservation? Why don't they fully exploit their rights freely 
  and shift for change? The only way to respond to these questions is: the downhearted 
  partition of women would not be uprooted until and unless the so-called patriarchal 
  rule of society is changed. <br>
  Reservation does not seek to eliminate the gender discrimination; it merely 
  aims to uplift some downtrodden castes and individuals, whether at the bottom 
  or the middle of the caste ladder. This ideology is a misconceived populist 
  move. Truly, it degrades women in one form or another. It is the biggest danger 
  because women form neither a separate group nor a separate caste, community, 
  class or section. In fact, men and women cannot be separated from each other. 
  They have common economic and social interests. <br>
  The slogan of reservation might have a different deeper purpose. Without a doubt 
  it appears to be a tactical move by certain groups to regain their position 
  through women; they otherwise stand to lose. Despite everything, women do not 
  realize that as women themselves they should not look down on other women and 
  make them feel small. <br>
  <br>
  <b>WAY OUT </b><br>
  <br>
  The proposed reservation ideology is not clear about the manner in which it 
  would uplift women. Also, no concrete yardsticks are perceived so far to make 
  women more deserving than others. No wonder, it is the worst thing we have ever 
  seen in the history of politics. Reservation neither heralds a big change nor 
  does it eliminate the pre-arranged social disorder or sins. At a time when the 
  state is deepening in crisis, the suitable social fabric should be the first 
  and foremost priority of everyone. Instead of putting emphasis on numerical 
  reservation, we have to carry on the everlasting equality between men and women 
  for the good of society and the nation as well. After all, reservation is an 
  insult to everyone; what do you think? <br>

<p class="text"><a name="91"></a>DEVELOPMENT THEORIES AND WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT</p>
<p class="text2"><b>Soni Thapa</b> <br>
  August 24, 2005<br>
  <br>
  The U.N. declaration of International Women's Year in 1975 awakened the world 
  for gender equality. Women's global movements of the 1960s and early 1970s have 
  underscored women's issues in hegemonic patriarchal societies. During the 1950s 
  and 1960s development era, women were not considered as subjects in development 
  practices. On one hand, men's roles in production - economically privileged 
  work  were highly valued. On the other hand, women's significant roles - both 
  productive and reproductive - were greatly devalued. Easter Boserup, in her 
  groundbreaking book Women's Role in Economic Development (1970), highlighted 
  the role of women as active producers. <br>
  Boserup's pioneer study - gender as a variable - and the U.N. declaration of 
  1975 have attempted to corroborate the significant contribution in development 
  arenas by women. In order to "integrate" women into development, the concept 
  of Women in Development (WID) was instigated. The approach of women's "integration" 
  into existing development - without reshuffling existing development paradigms 
  - inhibited women from partaking in formal economic sectors. The Women and Development 
  (WAD) approach that emerged in the second half of the 1970s merely focused on 
  the "relationship" between women and development and deliberately disregarded 
  women's oppression and subordination. <br>
  To bridge the gap that WID and WAD had previously overlooked, an alternative 
  approach, Gender and Development (GAD), was introduced in the 1980s. GAD examines 
  not only the sexual division of labor - "Who does what," but also scrutinizes 
  sexual division of resources - "Who has what." Here, "Who does what" scrutinizes 
  and analyzes gender division of labor by acknowledging and validating both men's 
  and women's contributions. Likewise, "Who has what" addresses an access to and 
  control over resources. It values both men's and women's productive, reproductive, 
  and community roles. Here, productive roles involve the production of food, 
  goods, and services for consumption and trade; reproductive roles include rearing 
  and caring of children and elderly people, cooking, fodder collection, and family 
  health care. Similarly, community roles deal with participating in ceremonies, 
  celebrations, group meetings, and involvement in local politics and organizations. 
  <br>
  Following the ratification of the U.N. Convention of the Elimination of all 
  forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979), Nepali government began 
  to address women's concern - primarily with regard to development sectors- from 
  the sixth five- year plan (1979-1984). A Women's Development Section (WDS) was 
  established, and the program titled "Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW)" 
  was initiated to ameliorate the economic status of poor women through small-scale 
  production activities. Subsequently, the government, International Non-Government 
  Organizations, (INGOs), and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) became committed 
  towards the empowerment of women. In the past, many programs implemented through 
  the WID approach basically focused on income generating programs (goat raising, 
  pig raising, poultry etc). As the approach merely viewed women as consumers, 
  mothers, and wives, it failed to address gender relation, and the redistribution 
  of resources. Later, many NGOs and INGOs started integrating GAD in their programs. 
  Acharya (2003) states that development theories should go beyond the welfare 
  approach by adequately focusing on gender equality. <br>
  In Nepal, one of the development practices that has been embraced and acknowledged 
  to empower women is "microfinance." The model that I have internalized, perhaps 
  the most successfully, is the idea that the beneficiaries should have equal 
  responsibility to design, plan, and implement their programs. Formation of women's 
  groups ensures their solidarity, and that groups are guaranteed to get loans 
  for their group without collateral. Apart from starting small enterprises, for 
  example, goat/pig/buffalo raising, poultry, retail shop, and kitchen gardening, 
  women initiate group savings too. After a few years, once women become competent 
  in handling both loans and enterprises, they may turn their small groups into 
  a cooperative: managed and operated solely by women. Women's empowerment is 
  only possible via microfinance when coupled with training components such as; 
  literacy, savings and credit, health care, and gender, to name a few. <br>
  As stated by Mayoux (1997) and based on my own experiences, conclusions can 
  be drawn that when a woman has access to loans, she can make decisions to set 
  up micro-enterprises, which can result in both income and repayments. Her status 
  in the family and society may escalate, since her economic contribution to the 
  family may become apparent. Further, Ackerly (1995) states that empowered women 
  who wisely invest money in a successful enterprise and positive outcomes of 
  empowerment may result in the discontinued battering by husbands to their wives, 
  the ability of the wives to finance children's education, improve family status, 
  and finally democratization of her decision-making power in family, as well 
  as in society. <br>
  Hence, there should be some intervention strategies aimed at bringing about 
  changes in the status of women. Social mobilization, group formation, informal 
  education, capacity building, and credits are powerful intervention methods 
  for empowering rural women. We still need to address practical needs, which 
  deal with immediate necessities such as food, clothes, education, and so forth. 
  In this context, meeting practical needs alone does not change the power relations 
  between men and women. Results become less sanguine with women's subordination 
  as a result of inadequately addressing strategic needs, i.e., control over property, 
  mobility, political involvement, and decision-making power. The empowerment 
  of women can only be realized by dismantling the hegemonic patriarchal society, 
  and thus legitimizing just, equitable society. <br>

<p class="text"><a name="90"></a>Gender Issues in Nepal</p>
<p class="text2"><b>By Purushottam Sigdel </b><br>
  July 31, 2005<br>
  <br>
  The definition of gender refers to a condition of being male or female on biological 
  ground. It may be interpreted in many ways but it is just a difference of sex. 
  Gender role refers to the set of behaviours of each sex in any society and gender 
  equality refers to the equal rights and opportunities granted to both men and 
  women. <br>
  An ultra-conservative society is widely considered discriminatory towards women. 
  It urges women to stick to its traditions and ignore liberalization and modernisation. 
  Women have been relegated to the roles of mere helpless housewives, not having 
  any personal identity, decency or dignity. Conservatives oppose any changes 
  that smack of most modern norms, which they view as licensuous. They allege 
  that modern societies are waging frenzied campaigns against their traditions, 
  saying that they are trying to incite women to shed their traditional norms, 
  ethics and values, which they are unnecessarily proud of. The religious edicts 
  prevailing in a conservative society like this have done nothing to raise a 
  woman's status, honor her and shield her virtue. The vital role that women play 
  in the building and development of society and their enormous sacrifices are 
  often utterly ignored. <br>
  Women have a respectful position in Sanatan (Hindu) Dharma. Our beliefs and 
  traditions consider the mother a hundred times superior than the father. 'Sarawsoti', 
  'Laxmi' and 'Durga' are greatly revered as the prosonification of 'great wisdom 
  and knowledge', 'great benefactor, love and kindness' and 'great forgiveness, 
  power and strength' respectively. But still the women in Nepal often become 
  victims of abuse and domestic violence. Gender disparities continue particularly 
  in the predominantly patriarchal society like ours, in which women are voiceless 
  and supressed. The women, half of Nepal's population, still face fearful odds 
  in a society that radically curtails their chances of success since birth. They 
  are deprieved of the same rights and opportunities that men have. Traditional 
  mindsets contribute to reinforcing the suppression of women, who are forced 
  to abort female fetuses because the family members desperately want a son. Normally, 
  women in our society don't have the right to decide who they want to marry or 
  where they want to live. In many cases, forced marriages are responsible for 
  driving many women to commit suicide.<br>
  The reason behind gender disparities and discrimination against women is lack 
  of proper education and awareness. Had people been taught that only the father's 
  reproductive chromosome, not the mother's, determines the birth of a male child, 
  the mother would not have suffered from the physical violence and psychological 
  trauma inflicted upon her by her in-laws and other family members for not giving 
  birth to a male child. Had people known this simple biological fact, the female 
  fetus would not have been killed in the mother's womb ; the girl child would 
  not have been taken as a burden in society. Had people loved their daughters 
  like sons, no society would have dared to exploit them physically, mentally 
  and socially. Had the law and society guaranteed equal rights to women, they 
  would have been able to compete with their male partners in every walk of life. 
  Teaching against the existing traditional and religious beliefs like child-marriage, 
  forced marriage, witchcraft, untouchability during menstruation cycle, son's 
  right to mortuary rites should be on the curriculum at every school. Above all 
  and most importantly, the state should guarantee educational and financial rights 
  to women so that they don't have to be the victims of their ruthless family 
  members and be lured by pimps and traffickers to brothels. <br>
  Nepal has a very feeble gender equality record and will have to do a lot to 
  achieve a certain level of gender equality . Only wishful thinking cannot end 
  the discrimination between men and women. The government should pledge to enact 
  legislation to ensure equal rights for women. It should enact a new law increasing 
  the penalties for men who abuse their wives and children. The law should provide 
  special protection measures for abused women and provide immediate legal recourse 
  for them. In many circumstances, women are betrayed by men. Children, born to 
  unknown fathers, should have the right to claim their citizenship certificates 
  through their mother's nationality. Abortion is also a burning issue in our 
  society and it should be considered as an integral part of women's rights. Abortion 
  should be decriminalized in case of rape, a malformed fetus or if there are 
  serious health risks to the woman. The daughters should be given the right to 
  inherit parental property like the sons. But, it seems that there is still no 
  firm sign of such legislation emerging. One lame excuse has followed another. 
  There has been delay after delay. The time for dithering is over. The lawmakers 
  should match their talk with deeds. Unfortunately, women have a poor number 
  of representation in the parliament and other organisations. If this number 
  could be increased, they would have an important role in the parliament and 
  could influence decision making in favour of women.<br>
  Women, on their part, too, should try to be independent and protect themselves. 
  They are a powerful force toward building a prosperous society. They should 
  encourage themselves to be physically, mentally and spiritually enriched. They 
  should involve themselves in promoting women's empowerment in social life. They 
  will have to launch a campaign against violence against women. They will have 
  to take their crusade against inequality to the parliament if not to the streets. 
  If women enjoy sitting behind the walls dependent on their husbands' earnings 
  and limited freedom given to them, society is sorry for them. They become vulnerable 
  to deception, infidelity and adultery. But, an important thing also to be noted 
  is that ultra-feminism is as fatal as male chauvinism. <br>
  Violence against women is a 'cancer' eating away at the core of every society, 
  in every country of the world ; it is a human rights atrocity. From the battlefield 
  to the bedroom, women are at risk. Governments are failing to address the real 
  terror in our world that millions of women face every day. Atrocities against 
  women including rape, murder, and mutilation must be stopped. Following the 
  recent upsurge in Maoist violence in Nepal, girls and women have often been 
  used, abused, mutilated, raped and murdered as weapons of war. Violence against 
  women is religiously, legally, socially and morally not acceptable to the civilised 
  world and should never be tolerated or justified. It can and must be stopped.

<p class="text"><a name="89"></a>Division of Household Labor: Toward Gender Equality </p>
<p class="text2">Soni Thapa<br>
  July 18, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Women's overarching inequality inside the home and outside is an upshot of the 
  patriarchal ideology. Even though there is a substantial shift with respect 
  to - women's participation in labor force- gender discrimination in household 
  labor still prevails granting lesser justice to women. An equitable society 
  should embrace equal distribution of power, division of labor, and opportunity 
  regardless of gender. Scholars highlight that to create gender equality both 
  men and women must have an equal opportunity in the labor market and should 
  share equal responsibility toward home and children. Thus, it is important to 
  analyze the division of household labor in the realm of gender equality. <br>
  The significance of household labor is unvalued/devalued socially, economically, 
  and politically. Housework is conceptualized as unpaid, tedious, time consuming, 
  but unavoidable for existence. A division of household labor primarily determines 
  who does the housework. Under the rubric of household work, cooking or meal 
  preparation is considered to be valued less and men rarely partake in it. Women's 
  increasing role outside of the household  be it at work or in getting an education 
   and that inside the home as a "second shift" or "double shift" create an incalculable 
  workload on women that needs to be explored and subsequently valued. <br>
  Different theoretical explanations or hypothesis deal with discrepancies on 
  the division of household labor: the time availability, the relative resource, 
  and the gender role ideology. The time availability hypothesis assumes that 
  sharing of household labor is directly proportional to the time availability. 
  Based on different methods and several studies, husbands' contribution toward 
  household work 10/15 hours per week is relatively small as opposed to women 
  spending more than 40 hrs per week. Research in 31 countries, both industrial 
  and developing, shows that women work longer hours than men in almost every 
  country. Of the total burden of work, women account for 53 per cent in developing 
  countries and 51 per cent in industrial countries of household labor. Thus, 
  there is no relationship between time availability and men's contribution toward 
  sharing gender roles within the country and across the globe. <br>
  Gender role ideology hypothesis relegates to gender roles that have been defined 
  by society. Household labor is embedded within social values and norms, giving 
  less equity to women. Greenstein (1996) reveals that gender ideology is different 
  than gender role; gender ideology meaning doing equal share of household work 
  rather than believing household work is women's work. The societal sex-role 
  perception has emancipated many men from household chores and detained many 
  women as unpaid labor. <br>
  The relative resources hypothesis assumes that those with greater power and 
  resources such as earning, education, and occupational prestige utilize the 
  power to avoid household work (Spitze, 1988). Even though research has shown 
  that women who are employed longer hours, earn more money, have more education, 
  and endorse gender equity, they contribute lesser toward housework, which is 
  paradoxical. Scholars underline that the greater the wife's power via earning 
  or education, the more equity she would get in household labor. However, women's 
  bargaining power is submerged under the pretext of gender-skewed social and 
  patriarchal ideology. <br>
  Even though men's participation appears to increase with higher level of education, 
  time availability, changing gender ideology or women's increasing bargaining 
  power, there is still gender disparity in terms of equal sharing of household 
  labor. Still on an average, women perform two or three times as much housework 
  as men. <br>
  Despite women's increasing involvement in labor force and education, they still 
  are considered as the primary caretaker of the house. Rendering value to household 
  work and transforming gender ideology could enable a change in men's perception 
  in understanding and sharing household labor. Men limit their household work 
  as voluntary work (whenever they feel like doing they do it, otherwise there 
  is no compulsion), but for women it is their duty. If she performs her duty, 
  she is a good wife; if she fails, she is vehemently ostracized. Our societal 
  definition of a man who cooks inside the house as "gender inappropriate" but 
  if he cooks outside the house as a chef as "gender appropriate" needs to be 
  transformed. Both types of work - whether it is inside the house or outside, 
  whether it is performed by men or women - should have equal value, respect, 
  and justice. A suggestion can be made that the government should give economic 
  value to household work. Giving value to household labor also increases gross 
  domestic income; hence, women's contribution will simultaneously become visible 
  in the country's Gross Domestic Product. <br>

  New Delhi July 11, 2005 <br>
  <br>
  A book by top Maoist leader Dr. Baburam Bhattrai was released July 9 in New 
  Delhi. The "Monarchy vs. Democracy- The Epic Fight in Nepal" is a collection 
  of Dr. Bhattrai's articles published after the infamous palace massacre of June, 
  2001. The book claims to give a vivid account of the nine-year long People's 
  War led by the CPN (Maoist). Published by Samakaleen Teesari Duniya, the book 
  was released by Prof. S.D. Muni. Prof. Ranadhir Singh, a veteran left intellectual 
  who has written a foreword in the book, chaired the function. <br>
  Left intellectual from Nepal Mr. Hari Roka, former professor of political science 
  in Delhi University Manoranjan Mohanty and well-known journalist associated 
  with the Economic and Political Weekly Mr. Gautam Naulakha also expressed their 
  views on the book at the function. <br>
  The book's publisher, well-known journalist Anand Swarup Barma, said the book 
  would be helpful in understanding the current political stand of Nepali Maoists. 
  He said the articles in the book and other releases by Maoist party chairman 
  Prachanda and spokesperson Mahara clearly express that the Maoists are committed 
  towards the multi party system. </p>

<p class="text"><a name="86"></a>Autocracy in the Family</p>
<p class="text2"><b>V. Androsiglio</b><br>
  July 09, 2005<br>
  <br>
  How can there be democracy in the country, when the Nepali family is autocratic?<br>
  How can men who demonstrate on the streets for democracy expect political change, 
  when they are autocrats at home? This also applies to women, who contribute 
  to this by accepting themselves as second class citizens.<br>
  If feudal values are to change, it must start socially and in the family. Otherwise, 
  it is hypocritical. Democracy is not something simply instituted by law--that's 
  only a small , but significant start. It is something you live and practice 
  in your daily life. Autocracy can be found in the dictatorial behavior of men 
  over women in Nepal. Democracy and dictatorship are not wedding partners.<br>
  Some examples: a Nepali couple are married ten years . They have five daughters. 
  Because the wife has not had a son ( which biologically, in fact is the man's 
  issue) he divorces her and abandons his children. He marries another women and 
  eventually she has a son. A son is depended upon to support the parents in their 
  old age and perform the funeral rites that assures their entrance into heaven.<br>
  Another man takes a second wife and invites her into the same household . The 
  first wife is expected to adjust to this complicated emotional triangle.<br>
  This is not an indictment of men. Instead, it suggests that antiquated values 
  don't work within the context of the 21st Century. Traditional values that hurt 
  people are of no value.<br>
  A university student finds out that his girlfriend is pregnant. He yells and 
  screams at her for not taking birth control pills. Meanwhile, he never used 
  a condom , himself. They never discussed contraceptives. He assumed it was all 
  her responsibility. She tricked me to get married was his theory. This young 
  man was panic stricken. His family just offered to send him the US to study. 
  If he told them , they would never accept the girl. It would bring disgrace 
  upon his family.<br>
  He suggested abortion. The girl refused. She wanted to get married . So, he 
  promised to marry her in two years. He lied. She bought it, went for an illegal 
  abortion, and is left feeling fear and shame. Abortion is now legal in Nepal-which 
  involves telling the parents. This, of course, encourages illegal abortions. 
  In the collision between traditional values and modern laws , the Nepali female 
  again seems to bear the brunt of it all--a situation that permeates numerous 
  cultures.<br>
  This is not too dissimilar to the traditional witch-folklore, which has been 
  used to "solve" social and psychological issues. A baby dies in a village. The 
  finger is pointed at a women who happened to be near the child before it died. 
  The local priest is consulted; paid, of course-- and pronounces the women a 
  witch and the cause of the mishap. The witch-folklore is a defensive maneuver 
  used to avoid personal responsibility. It is destructive because it blames and 
  dominates women. Ironically, a major part of this problem is that women themselves 
  participate in the blaming. <br>
  Drug addiction is quickly spreading among women. Unlike male addicts ,who are 
  given a god-like status in the family and actually given money to buy drugs---the 
  female addict once discovered---is thrown out of the house .Prostitution usually 
  becomes her only option.<br>
  Finally, the rapt issue. This is the most outrageous, undemocratic violation 
  of a women. It gives a man the right to marry a women he has raped. If she refuses 
  and has his child, the child cannot become a Nepali citizen (only males can 
  bestow citizenship) and the child, therefore, cannot attend school. This is 
  a law on the modern 1990 constitution. The stories are endless, from wife-beating, 
  to unfair division of labor, to the basic attitude that a wife's life is solely 
  to serve the needs of her husband.<br>
  Again, is it possible to have a democracy in a country where there is a dictatorship 
  in the family? When women are no longer dictated to by men ,and women no longer 
  accept this position ,that would, indeed , be a real sign of the spirit of democracy 
  evolving----maybe more so than who's in charge, demonstrations and futile bickerings 
  in the newspapers.<br>

<p class="text"><a name="85"></a>As the apology continues, a bit of truth seeps through</p>
<p class="text2"><b>Hari Bansha Dulal</b><br>
  June 13, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Recently 39 people lost their lives in Madi, Chitwan when Maoists ambushed a 
  passenger bus in a broad day light. This latest massacre, in chitwan, reveals 
  that all the talk of the Maoists chief about refraining civilian attacks is 
  nothing but hot air. Those killed included infants, women, and some senior citizens. 
  Their mistake was that they were born in Prachanda's Nepal. Prachanda described 
  the incident as a case of mistaken identity. How easy it is for him to describe 
  someone else's irreversible loss as a case of mistaken identity. Had they been 
  his own siblings, he would have definitely felt the pain. Ask families of those 
  who lost their lives in this heinous crime against the humanity and you will 
  know what it is like to loose someone you really love and care about. Mr. Prachanda, 
  &quot;'The wearer knows best where the shoe pinches'. <br>
  Out of those 39 people, some might have been the bread winner for their families. 
  Their dreams are shattered. As they are gone now, their families will have to 
  find ways to survive. Survival has become a big thing in Prachanda's Nepal. 
  A herd of ill trained and brain washed guerrillas can sign off anyone's life 
  as they did in this case. The bus they ambushed is supposed to be carrying three 
  security personnel on board. Maoists mass murdered 39 and injured scores of 
  innocent civilians on board to get rid of those three security personnel. This 
  incident exhibits how weak Maoist guerrillas are when it comes to tactical soundness. 
  Killing 39 individuals in order to get rid of 3 security personal is an example 
  of gross miscalculation, ill preparedness, and a tactical error. <br>
  This is not the first time that Maoists have killed innocent civilians. They 
  have done it again and again and gotten away with apology. Is human life worth 
  just an apology? Definitely not in civilized society. Mr. Prachanda, ask your 
  guerillas who barely escaped security personnel's bullet and they will tell 
  you how precious life is and how lucky they are to be alive. Attacking innocent 
  civilians riding a bus is not courageous; it is heinous crime and will be punished 
  on the day of judgment, if any. It is by no means courageous to attack innocent 
  infants, women and senior citizens. It is courageous to protect freedom; it 
  is courageous to defend oneself and not to attack. <br>
  People learn from mistakes and this is not the first time that maoist guerillas 
  have committed mistake of attacking innocent civilians. There can be two reasons 
  behind the repeated mistakes. Either maoist guerillas are ill trained and tactically 
  weak or they are out of control, or may be both. If Maoist leadership cannot 
  control their ill trained unleashed guerrillas, they should not let them loose. 
  Maoists should try winning the hearts and mind of Nepalese people rather than 
  hurting their sentiments if they want their dream of republican state come true. 
  Power gained through blood shed doesn't last for long. Terror reign of Mullah 
  Mohammad Omar, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussain, and Hitler did not last for long. <br>

<p class="text"><a name="84"></a>ANA Condemns Bus Attack</p>
<p class="text2">Washington, D.C. <br>
  June 10, 2005<br>
  <br>
  The Association of Nepalis in the Americas (ANA) strongly denounced the June 
  6th landmine attack on a bus that killed 39 and injured 70 passengers in Chitawan, 
  Nepal.<br>
  In a press release, ANA President Krishna Nirola said the organization was deeply 
  disturbed by the heinous crime that killed so many innocent civilians. We mourn 
  those dead in this senseless violence and send our deepest condolences to their 
  families, he said.<br>
  The Maoists have claimed responsibility for the attack and have offered an apology. 
  But their apology has become too common to have any credibility, the ANA press 
  release said, referring to their broken promises in the past. They apologized 
  when they hung a journalist; they apologized when they killed an innocent school 
  teacher and now, yet another apology.<br>
  The ANA said the Maoists could demonstrate their sincerity only by immediately 
  stopping their tactics of targeting civilians, perpetuating violence, intimidating 
  and terrorizing the Nepali society.<br>
  The Maoists claim of compliance with international treaties including Geneva 
  Convention on "Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War" rings hollow when 
  they persistently use landmines to terrorize, maim and kill innocent people, 
  the ANA said.<br>
  The press release highlighted the fact that use of landmines is banned under 
  an international treaty signed by more than 100 countries. It said landmines 
  lay hidden and unexploded and posed threat even after the cessation of conflict 
  and continued to kill. In Cambodia, people are still being maimed and killed 
  by landmines. We believe that no one with an iota of humanity should use landmines 
  in any circumstances. <br>
  The ANA urged the Nepali government along with the international community to 
  find the perpetrators of these killings and immediately bring them to justice.<br>
  The organization also asked the Nepali government and the Maoists to urgently 
  find a negotiated settlement to the ongoing violence, and move towards peace 
  and democracy in the country. Violence as a means to win any ideological war 
  can never be supported by the people or the international community, it said. 
  We deplore such cowardly activities and expect it will never be repeated in 
  the future.</p>


<p class="text"><a name="83"></a>TONI HAGEN'S UHILEKO NEPAL AND AHILEKO NEPAL</p>
<p class="text2"><b>Srijana Aryal Nepal</b><br>
  Florida Atlantic University, USA, June 01, 2005<br>
  <br>
  There are many non- Nepalis who have done remarkable, outstanding and memorable 
  deeds for Nepal and whose debt the Nepalis will owe forever.<br>
  Among them is a remarkable man: explorer, environmentalist, geologist, scientist, 
  teacher, journalist but most importantly, a true friend of Nepal- Dr. Toni Hagen. 
  He so dearly and truly loved Nepal that his love for Nepal has been an example 
  unheard of. And as the environment day just passed by, recalling his contribution 
  around this time would be a real tribute to him.<br>
  He helped to put Nepal in the world map and he introduced Nepal to the world. 
  He adored Nepal so much that he lived through the cultures of Nepal and he died 
  with it. His wish was to scatter his ashes from what was left of his (im) mortal 
  remains in a country, very far from his motherland, where he took his las breath. 
  His ashes were brought all the way from Switzerland and scattered over the Khumbu 
  icefall, along the very path, which he had taken 50 years ago in "Uhileko" Nepal.<br>
  "My father's wish was to be cremated and his ashes brought to Nepal," said his 
  daughter, who was satisfied that his ashes joined the mountains of Nepal that 
  he cared for so much.<br>
  He proved that he loved Nepal- the country, which was not even his birthplace.<br>
  People close to Toni Hagen, describe him as an optimistic person, who always 
  believed that Nepal had progressed remarkably in the last few decades and most 
  importantly, was not disappointed with the political disturbances. They say 
  he was a great source of inspiration. He used to ask opinion about different 
  activities in Nepal, and strongly place the opinion at relevant place and always 
  took it in positive light. He believed in development, democracy and decentralization. 
  He believed in indigenous capacity of Nepal.<br>
  "The people have to participate in shaping their own destiny. No one can dictate 
  to them, and you cannot have democracy through violence and bloodshed."<br>
  This is what I read in the newspaper, about his hope for Nepal.<br>
  I would like to rephrase a line from a famous poem for Ahileko Nepal.<br>
  "Peace, peace everywhere, nor a pinch to feel."<br>
  Why can't there be unity in anything and among any party?<br>
  Do not we want to shape the destiny of our own country?<br>
  A bitter truth, in Toni's Uhileko Nepal all the Nepalis and non- Nepalis were 
  optimistic and there was peace, whereas, in Ahileko Nepal very few are optimistic 
  and there is all but peace. In Ahileko Nepal every Nepali is dreaming for peace. 
  The king is seeking peace. The ruling party wants peace, revolutionaries are 
  for peace, and the opposition parties need peace. The teachers, the students 
  and the parents, all are for peace. Though, the air in Nepal is full of peace 
  talks there has been no peace but only protests. Peace has been the 'mantra' 
  to play with the peace of Nepal. It seems, for us the protest has metamorphosed 
  into peace and we see peace in protest.<br>
  But no, at this crucial moment also, we are witnessing protests and closures. 
  Can Nepal afford more? We celebrated the 50th year of the ascent of Mt. Everest 
  - the world's highest mountain, which undoubtedly drew worldwide attention. 
  Sadly enough, equal attention was drawn by violent protests that marred the 
  celebration in the capital. And such events can be tall enough to shadow even 
  the highest point on earth. The history is there to evaluate how high did Nepal 
  climb, in all these years.<br>
  Even the only need of the country- the 'Mt. Everest need', could not awaken 
  our leaders and followers to make every effort to offer peace to Nepal. Mt. 
  Everest, no matter how many ascend and descend over it, in no matter how many 
  years- is getting polluted climb after climb and no matter how many projects 
  and people come and work for Nepal, the country is being enlisted as one of 
  the poorest nations in the world year after year and no matter how many parties 
  come to power - the Nepali people, are forever searching for peace, day after 
  day.<br>
  Now, with the latest political development, let's hope there will be lasting 
  peace. And that peace will prevail as envisioned by all the Nepalis and non- 
  Nepalis of Ahileko Nepal. Let's hope the political parties will take this opportunity 
  to prove that they are not after power and position but for the people.<br>
  Talking about Toni again- the scribe had the opportunity to meet this personality, 
  quite a few times. At all those times I found him so concerned about Nepal and 
  only Nepal. Despite his advanced years and ill- health, he was always thinking 
  about Nepal- dreaming about transforming Nepal. While talking to me he had said, 
  " Nepal is my second home". At that time these five words meant very little 
  to me. I thought he must have said so, just to please Nepalis, like every other 
  foreigner. But I had never thought that this very statement would ring in my 
  ears one day, and keep on ringing for the remaining years of my life, whenever 
  I recalled his contribution and love toward Nepal. How true those words proved 
  to be.<br>
  He was about to leave for Nepal. This time, he came to Nepal and never left. 
  Even his death could not prevent him from visiting Nepal. So strong was his 
  commitment, so ardent was his love for Nepal that he has come to live with us 
  forever.<br>
  Our Ahileko Nepal needs powerful leaders, a few peace makers, who prove their 
  commitment and show that they love Nepal beyond everything -- above power, position, 
  party, politics, personal interests and protests. <br>
  Be it the exemplary love like Toni's- which was even above his place of birth.<br>

<p class="text"><a name="82"></a>Immorality: The Root Cause of Our Samassya</p>
<p class="text2"><b>By Shankar Kunwar & Umesh Giri</b><br>
  May 22, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Samassya ka jara khojaun, samassya ka jara chinaun! <br>
  Khojera dharilo sastra, jara kati nirmul garaun!!<br>
  <br>
  Lets look for the roots of the problems, lets identify the roots. Having found 
  a sharp weapon, lets cut the roots and eradicate them.<br>
  We got multiparty democracy, one of the best political systems on earth, in 
  2007 BS. A decade-long, full-fledged democratic practice did nothing better 
  but help the king to assume executive power. The kings three-decade- long active 
  rule, the Panchayet, was widely condemned and multiparty democracy was resumed 
  in 2046. In other words, the year 2007 was repeated. Most of us have witnessed 
  this fourteen-year- long democratic period, boy, was it a perfect mess! The 
  king found enormous reasons again to dismiss multiparty system and condemn its 
  advocates. We are back in 2017. We believe the cycle will continue.<br>
  This political system doesnt work. That political system doesnt work. We keep 
  changing system after system as if that was our destiny. There has always been 
  a good ground to condemn every preceding system by the leading system, but none 
  of them could really survive and be sustained. Lets stop condemning each other, 
  now we have enough data to claim that the political system is a problem but 
  not the problem.<br>
  We are living with centuries-long problems like poverty, illiteracy, discrimination, 
  irregularity, corruption, injustice, so on and so forth. Why could neither kings 
  nor peoples government solve our problems? The answer is fairly simple, because 
  none of them knows the roots of the problems.<br>
  We believe most of the heads of governments want to do well in their tenure, 
  because no one wants to be condemned, everybody loves to be praised. But, they 
  fail to do so because they cant reach to the roots of the problem. You cant 
  destroy a bush just by slashing it.<br>
  The roots of the problems are in society. Society has sunk in a black hole of 
  immorality that none of us can escape out of. No political system has the strength 
  to change the peoples mentality. Those who ran multiparty democracy during 
  2007-2017 BS were from the same society as were the people who ran the Panchayet. 
  Todays democratic leaders and Panchayeti leaders are from the same community 
  and tomorrows leaders will also be products of the same society, no matter 
  what names do they give themselves .<br>
  We are accusing the leaders. Who are the leaders? They are among us. We make 
  leaders, we choose leaders; we are part of the system. If we were the leaders, 
  we wouldnt be doing any differently than what these leaders have done and have 
  been doing. Leaders make the country, there is no doubt, but to have such leaders 
  we need to have good society. Good society may produce good leaders, which can 
  be anticipated. But, immorality is widespread in our society; whether we are 
  heads of the country or of small communities, we are unaware of morality. It 
  is said that there is a political crisis in Nepal, but we say there is a crisis 
  of everything and morality crisis is the cause of all the crises.<br>
  Three decades of active monarchy and two and a half decades of multiparty system 
  have already shown us what they could do (or not do). Now, there are some people 
  who believe communism will work, but we can see from others experience that 
  communism offered nothing good to the world. How can we be exceptional? Some 
  people think that the king is the major source of the problems and the country 
  needs to be transformed into a democratic republic. Our neighbor Bangladesh 
  has been practicing it since its birth, and we dont think it is the best country 
  as an example to follow. Nothing will work until society possesses significant 
  number of good hearts, those who have morals.<br>
  Freedom is a human beings birthright. A competitive democratic system, and 
  the rule of people, by people and for people are necessary for development, 
  but it is not sufficient without morality. We can take Bihar, a state of one 
  of our neighbors, India, as an example. It was a highly dominant place in ancient 
  India and the richest state when the British left. It is now the most lawless 
  and poorest state despite having practiced one of the best political systems 
  in the planet for more than half a century. Until and unless morality is installed 
  in society, dont expect any political system to have the caliber to transform 
  society. Morality is an unconditional requirement for progress.<br>
  My philosophy is better, his philosophy is wrong. I care for my country, he 
  doesnt. My philosophy addresses the major problems of the country, his philosophy 
  doesnt. This is what we have been doing. There is only one problem, immorality, 
  and it is the seed of all the problems. Why have so many different, complex 
  philosophies? Be moral and do moral is the simplest and most efficient philosophy 
  ever. You dont need to crack down on corruption, irregularity, segregation, 
  poverty, illiteracy etc, they will automatically fade out once you crack down 
  on immorality, just like the shrub will dry out itself once you destroy its 
  roots.<br>
  After all, what is a country? A country is an assembly of individuals. Each 
  individual should feel it is his/her personal responsibility to be a moral person. 
  No one can be moral for you and no one can make you moral. We (the writing duo) 
  can make only ourselves moral individually, thats why we, as responsible citizens, 
  are struggling to practice morality. We believe this will be the greatest contribution 
  to our country on our part.</p>

  The representatives of six Nepali political parties met with Indias Minister 
  for External Affairs K. Natwar Singh on May 20. The delegates presented the 
  minister their joint road map for the restoration of full democracy and peace 
  in Nepal.<br>
  The delegates were Pradi Giri  Nepali Congress (D), Rajan Bhattarai  CPN (UML), 
  Dr. Shekhar Koirala and Mathura Prasad Ghimire  Nepali Congress, Hridayesh 
  Tripathi and Rajendra Mahto  Nepal Sadbhawana Party (A), Chandra Dev Joshi 
   United Left Front, and Ganga Paudel  Peoples Front.<br>
  According to a Nepal Democracy and Human Rights Advocacy Center press release, 
  the delegates at the meeting raised the issue of Indias resumption of arms 
  support to the present Nepali government. Reiterating Indias commitment to 
  Nepals fight for democracy, Minister Singh explained the specific conditions 
  under which Indias arms supplies to Nepal have resumed.<br>
  The meeting concluded that unity among political parties alone could ensure 
  a sovereign, prosperous and peaceful Nepal. All agreed that Nepals political 
  system is to be the handiwork of Nepalese people alone.</p>


<p class="text"><a name="80"></a>100-day Anniversary of King Gyanendra's Executive Power </p>
<p class="text2"><b>Somnath Ghimire</b><br>
  May 21, 2005<br>
  <br>
  King Gyanendra had pledged to restore Nepal 's democratic institutions by now. 
  May 11 marked the 100-day anniversary of King Gyanendra's takeover; the deadline 
  he set for himself to restore democratic institutions in Nepal. We all are still 
  waiting for the king to prove his commitment to restore democratic freedoms 
  as quickly as possible.<br>
  <br>
  King Gyanendra provoked widespread international condemnation when, backed by 
  the military, he dismissed the government, and arrested scores of political 
  rivals, journalists and activists. The king said he had to act because Nepal 
  's political parties had failed to organize elections or to defeat the insurgency 
  plaguing much of the countryside. <br>
  <br>
  On April 29, 2005, the king lifted the formal state of emergency and released 
  some high-profile political leaders. But, hundreds of people are still in detention, 
  the lifting of emergency is nothing more than an attempt to appease the international 
  community. The king has done nothing to restore democracy and civil liberties 
  in Nepal . Regardless of the king's takeover, fighting against rebels in the 
  countryside continues unabated. On May 9, 2005, clashes between security forces 
  and Maoists left more than 40 people dead in Siraha.<br>

  Since the king seized power, the bloodshed has worsened. According to human 
  rights groups, nearly seven people a day have been killed since King Gyanendras 
  takeover and most of them are innocent civilians. <br>
  <br>
  King's Step: Constitutional Perspective <br>
  <br>
  On February 1, 2005, at 10.0 am, King Gyanendra declared dissolution of the 
  eight-month-old four-party government (the coalition government formed on June 
  2, 2004) and assumed executive power. The proclamation was broadcast through 
  the state-owned media, Nepal Television and Radio Nepal .<br>
  <br>
  He proclaimed, "As it is our responsibility to preserve our nationalism, national 
  unity and sovereignty, as well as to maintain peace and security in the country 
  and ensure that the state of the nation does not deteriorate any further, we 
  have by virtue of the state authority as exercised by us and in keeping with 
  the spirit of the constitution of the kingdom of Nepal, 1990, taking into consideration 
  Article 27 (3) of the constitution, dissolved, effective from today, the current 
  council of ministers to fulfill the people's desire for the restoration of peace 
  and security and to activate soon the democratic dispensation. The council of 
  ministers to be constituted will be under our chairmanship. This council of 
  ministers will give utmost priority to reactivating multiparty democracy in 
  the country within three years with the implementation of effective reforms 
  by restoring peace and security."<br>
  <br>
  Article 27(3) reads as follows: "His Majesty is to preserve and protect this 
  constitution by keeping in view the best interests and welfare of the people 
  of Nepal." Primarily, there is no provision for a 'chairperson' to head the 
  council of ministers under the present constitution. The king 'holds' the chairmanship 
  of the cabinet. The king has very limited power to exercise at his discretion: 
  Article 28 (2): King enjoys exclusive power to enact, amend and repeal the law 
  relating to succession to the throne by his descendants. Article 34 (1): He 
  can constitute a Raj Parishad.<br>
  <br>
  Whatever words he has gathered to justify his move, his is an unconstitutional 
  move. However, he has repeatedly cited the constitution of the kingdom of Nepal-1990. 
  So, it would be relevant to match his actions with the constitutional provisions. 
  It is worthy to mention here that Article 35(2), reads, "Except as otherwise 
  expressly provided as to be exercised exclusively by His Majesty or at his discretion 
  or on the recommendation of any institution or official, the power of His Majesty 
  under this constitution shall be exercised upon the recommendation and advice 
  and with the consent of the council of ministers. Such recommendation, advice 
  and consent shall be submitted through the prime minister."<br>
  <br>
  King sacked Deuba government, declared nationwide state of emergency. By whom 
  was the king recommended to terminate Sher Bahadur Deuba and impose emergency?<br>
  <br>
  Some Key Provisions Today:<br>
  <br>
  Article 35 (1): Executive power the kingdom of Nepal has vested in His Majesty 
  and the council of ministers.<br>
  <br>
  Article 36 (1): constitution of council of ministers- The king appoints the 
  leader of the party which commands a majority in the House of Representatives 
  as prime minister.<br>
  <br>
  Article 36 (3): King appoints deputy prime minister, state ministers and assistant 
  ministers on the recommendation of the prime minister.<br>
  <br>
  Article 36 (4): Prime minister and other ministers to be collectively responsible 
  to the House of Representatives.<br>
  <br>
  Article 36 (7): proviso- If prime minister dies, king appoints deputy prime 
  minister or the senior most minister to act as prime minister until a new prime 
  minister is appointed.<br>
  <br>
  Article 42: If no one party has a clear majority in the Lower House, a member 
  of the House who is able to command a majority there is to be appointed as prime 
  minister.<br>
  <br>
  Article (43): Duty of prime minister to inform the king on decisions of cabinet, 
  bills and other concerned issues.<br>
  <br>
  Article (117): Prime minister is the chairperson of the constitutional council 
  which has the responsibility to recommend names for appointment in constitutional 
  bodies.<br>
  <br>
  Article 87: Appointment of Chief Justice<br>
  <br>
  Article 97 (2): Appointment of chief commissioner and commissioners of commission 
  for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority <br>
  <br>
  Article 99 (1): Appointment of Auditor General<br>
  <br>
  Article 101 (2): Appointment of the Chairperson and members of Public Service 
  Commission<br>
  <br>
  Article 103 (2): Appointment of chairperson and members of Election Commission<br>
  <br>
  Article 109: Prime Minister recommends to the king for the appointment of Attorney 
  General of Nepal.<br>
  <br>
  Article 115: Prime minister recommends for the imposition of the state of emergency.<br>
  <br>
  Article 118: Prime minister is the chairperson of National Defense Council of 
  Nepal. The same Article incorporates that army operates on the recommendation 
  of the council. The king is now the defense minister of Nepal . Defense minister 
  is also a member of the council.<br>
  <br>
  Accountability Deceived:<br>
  <br>
  In accordance with Article 31 of the constitution, no question can be raised 
  against the king. The provision reads: No question shall be raised in any court 
  about any act performed by His Majesty. So, the king's acts cannot be challenged 
  even in the court. And, he is responsible to nobody as such! Is it rule of law 
  that no one is held responsible for his deeds, especially misdeeds? Who is responsible 
  for the deteriorating state of affairs after the king's assumption of power? 
  Should anybody be given impunity for his/her misdeeds?<br>
  <br>
  The much talked about Article 127 of the present constitution, that the king 
  has been mentioning frequently while changing governments five times right from 
  2002, reads as follows: "Power to remove difficulties: If any difficulty arises 
  in connection with the implementation of this constitution, His Majesty may 
  issue necessary orders to remove such difficulty and such orders shall be laid 
  before parliament."<br>
  <br>
  The preamble of the constitution of the kingdom of Nepal, 1990, reads: "Guarantee 
  of basic human rights to every citizen of Nepal, the parliamentary system of 
  government, constitutional monarchy and the system of multiparty democracy by 
  promoting amongst the people of Nepal the spirit of fraternity and the bond 
  of unity on the basis of liberty and equality; and also to establish an independent 
  and competent system of justice with a view to transforming the concept of rule 
  of law into a living reality." But, the king's present step has crushed the 
  major thrust of the constitution, formulated after the Popular Movement in 1990.<br>
  <br>
  Formation of the Royal Commission on Corruption Control (RCCC):<br>
  <br>
  The Royal Commission on Corruption Control (RCCC) is not aimed at addressing 
  corruption but at silencing all forms of dissent whether by political leaders 
  or judges. The Royal Commission on Corruption Control has paralyzed the existing 
  body for investigation into corruption i.e. the Commission for Investigation 
  of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)<br>
  <br>
  A special court meant to consider the CIAAs prosecutions. The RCCC can even 
  investigate the judges of the Supreme Court and office bearers of all constitutional 
  bodies. The RCCC may proceed with prosecution against such individuals as long 
  as it has informed the king. With the Supreme Court already submissive and intimidated, 
  the independence of judges has been destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  The royal edit on the RCCC forbids any criticism of the commission and gives 
  punishment for such criticism. It also prohibits anyone from protesting an investigation 
  being conducted by the commission and gives punishment for such protest. While 
  there is provision for appeal to the Supreme Court within 35 days of a decision 
  by the commission, with the Supreme Court judges coming under the purview of 
  the Royal Commission on Corruption, there is no forum to seek justice.<br>
  <br>
  By now, our king should know that there is no military solution to the existing 
  problems in the country. Ultimately, it has to be resolved on the negotiating 
  table with the inclusion of the political forces. We are anxiously waiting for 
  the decision of our king, as how many more days he needs for the revival of 
  the democratic process, civil liberties and press freedom in Nepal. In the 100-day 
  anniversary, King Gyanendra could not come up with a new military strategy to 
  deal with the insurgency, and the chances of developing a viable political strategy, 
  without which any military operation cannot be effective, have been further 
  reduced. Although the international pressure has forced the king to reconsider 
  some of his actions, the questions of restoring democracy and tackling the insurgency 
  have not been addressed yet.<br>
  <br>
  Only when a broad-based strategy can be agreed on and implemented by all democratic 
  political forces in Nepal will talks with the Maoists be possible that stand 
  any chance of success. But, without further strong international pressure, the 
  king will continue to entrench his power at the expense of democracy, and Nepal 
  will continue to suffer from demoralizing conflict that might lead to cold war.<br>
  <br>
  It is hoped that the demonstration held on May 15 in front of the White House 
  in D.C. will put tough pressure on King Gyanendra to restore democracy in Nepal.</p>

<p class="text"><a name="79"></a>Out of The Silence</p>
<p class="text2"><b>By Kristin Jones</b><br>
  May 07, 2005</p>
<p class="text2">At 10:25 a.m. on February 1, King Gyanendra of Nepal delivered a stunning proclamation- 
  Nepal's multi-party government had been dismissed and a state of emergency declared. 
  Simultaneously, telephone lines across the country were cut, mobile phone service 
  discontinued, and fax and Internet connections shut down. Backed by the Royal 
  Nepalese Army, the king seized state television and radio, placed the country's 
  political leaders under house arrest, and silenced the press with military occupations 
  of major media houses and wide bans on reporting.<br>
  In the silence that followed, a surprising thing happened.<br>
  The king was unable to shut off Nepal from the rest of the world. Rather, in 
  the days after the coup, smuggled e-mails, clandestine Web sites, and the unlikely 
  emergence of a handful of Nepalese bloggers threw the government and independent 
  journalists into a cat-and-mouse chase. The king's unintentional result: While 
  attempting to plunge Nepal into a communications dark age, he spawned a small 
  legion of online journalists.<br>
  Shortly after the announcement, Tara Nath Dahal, president of the Federation 
  of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) emerged from his home to find the streets deserted. 
  When he arrived at the umbrella organization's building, "no journalists had 
  come to the office for fear of arrest," he said in a CPJ interview. Resolved 
  to take a stand against the king's curtailment of Nepal's hard-won press freedom, 
  Dahal met with FNJ General Secretary Bishnu Nisthuri and decided to risk arrest 
  by writing a statement that would condemn the king's actions and boost the morale 
  of his colleagues.<br>
  "The royal announcement made yesterday, by ending the spirit and value of the 
  constitution of Nepal, is a coup against democracy and peoples' rights," the 
  explosive first sentence read. The following morning, Dahal met with other central 
  committee members of the FNJ and secretly printed out the statement.<br>
  Now came the hard part-distribution. Without telephone, fax, e-mail, or Internet, 
  the statement was delivered to international non governmental organizations, 
  diplomatic offices, media houses, and foreign journalists by bicycle and motorcycle 
  couriers. Within hours, it had been photocopied countless times. Soon, it was 
  translated into English, and, via satellite connections accessible to diplomats 
  and foreign journalists, an electronic version appeared in in-boxes across the 
  world.<br>
  Dahal went into hiding. When security forces surrounded his house and harassed 
  his family, Nisthuri wrote and distributed a statement calling attention to 
  the treatment of the FNJ president. On February 4, it was Nisthuri who was arrested.<br>
  In those initial days, the coup seemed to generate little national protest. 
  Racked by a civil conflict between Maoist rebels and the government, Nepal had 
  been run down by violence. Faith in political parties had been compromised by 
  corruption. Some Nepalese believed that the king's drastic actions were in order; 
  many feared that dissent would mean arrest. And in a poor country where only 
  about 80,000 of 27 million citizens are regular Internet users, where illiteracy 
  is high and phone lines don't reach large swaths of the mountains, a communications 
  blackout isn't a life changing event for many people.<br>
  Dinesh Wagle, an arts reporter for Nepal's major daily Kantipur and a pioneering 
  Nepalese blogger, was entirely absent from the blogosphere during the first 
  week of the coup. The Internet remained down until February 8, and he lacked 
  access to expensive satellite connections. Regardless, his United We Blog! (UWB, 
  www.blog. com.np), had rarely dealt with politics. The site was primarily an 
  English language diary with threads on music, parties, and the media.<br>
  But when Internet communication resumed, Kantipur and all other media outlets 
  were still barred from any reporting "that goes against the letter and the spirit 
  of the royal proclamation." So, while the king's army dismantled community radio 
  and choked dissent in the country's Nepali-language publications, the Web site 
  posted its new motto: "United We Blog! wants Peace and Democracy [to] be restored 
  in Nepal as soon as possible."<br>
  Wagle's colleagues began to see the blog in a new light, he said. "Even those 
  folks at Kantipur who didn't read my blogs or simply ignored them are now following 
  daily," he wrote in an e-mail to CPJ. "Political reporters also share info with 
  me that they can't write in Kantipur." The site provided extensive, street-level 
  coverage of political protests and reports on the arrests of colleagues. Interest 
  soared, both inside and outside of Nepal.<br>
  The king restored communications with a caveat: security forces could monitor 
  and block media outlets as they saw fit. Were online journalists putting themselves 
  at risk? Wagle admitted that there were submissions he would not post-for example, 
  statements calling for an end to the monarchy. Radio Free Nepal, another blog 
  that emerged after the coup, posted comments anonymously in order to protect 
  contributors.<br>
  By April, these two blogs had escaped direct government censorship, but other 
  news Web sites such as the Nepali Post, a Washington, D.C.-based Nepali-language 
  online magazine, had been targeted. Editor Girish Pokhrel said that the government 
  blocked the Web site in Nepal shortly after the resumption of Internet service.<br>
  Despite its resolve, the Nepalese government may not have the resources for 
  sophisticated Internet surveillance and blocking. Pokhrel found that readers 
  in Nepal soon accessed the site through overseas proxy servers, which retrieve 
  Web site contents on the user's behalf. When those proxy servers were blocked, 
  readers found new ones.<br>
  Newslook, a U.S.-based English-language Web site that culls international headlines, 
  saw its readership in Nepal multiply by five during the month of February. Editor 
  Dharma Adhikari, a Nepal-born journalism professor at Georgia Southern University, 
  told CPJ that the number of hits from Nepal dropped by only 10 percent when 
  the government blocked the site around February 23. Somehow users were finding 
  a way to get through.<br>
  For the most part, Nepalese authorities showed greater tolerance for critical 
  commentary in online news sources than in print publications, and allowed more 
  freedom in English-language media than in Nepali language media. In a country 
  where the Internet is prohibitively expensive and most people do not speak English, 
  the government may not have viewed most online journalism as a threat. Internet 
  journalists, in general, were not in a position to report on the political conflict 
  that raged in the country's rural areas. On the other hand, the king's post-coup 
  directives struck at the heart of community radio, a primary source of information 
  for the many Nepalese who are illiterate. Independent newscasts were banned, 
  and reports on the Maoist insurgency were restricted. <br>
  As Nepalese began to report electronically to the world, however, the world 
  responded. The international outcry over the imprisonment of Nisthuri helped 
  to win his release on February 25. Though under pressure from the government, 
  Dahal evaded arrest and teamed with other advocates to launch the Web site Press 
  Freedom Nepal (www.pressfreedomnepal.org), which posts press freedom violations 
  and relevant news. The fight for the Internet is not over, but Newslook editor 
  Adhikari pointed out the greatest hope for budding online journalists.<br>
  "Censoring the 'Net is not that easy," he observed. Even for an absolute monarch.<br>

<p class="text"><a name="78"></a>India: Our Friendly Big Brother or an Imperialistic Hegemonist?</p>
<p class="text2"><b>Avantika Regmi</b><br>
  May 03, 2005<br>
  <br>
  King Gyanendra lifted (?) the 3 month old emergency yesterday at the 'order' 
  of India. There is no doubt that this move has not been without an ulterior 
  motive, which is to get the much anticipated arms and ammunitions rolling into 
  Nepal.<br>
  <br>
  It appears that after the recent meeting with the Indian Foreign Minister Natwar 
  Singh and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the Asia-Africa 
  summit in Indonesia, King Gyanendra was successful in convincing the Indian 
  government of the necessity of his Feb 1 step to protect Nepal's [Monarchy's?] 
  future from the grave &quot;risks&quot; of a total Maoist victory. If India 
  resumes military aid and legitimizes the king's move then this would be nothing 
  short of back-stabbing the democracy movement in Nepal in which regional stability 
  again scores over democracy. Pro-democracy people of Nepal still genuinely believe 
  that the Manmohan Singh government has not caved in to the king's lies, and 
  yet in the last 55 odd years there were several occasions when democracy could 
  have gained a credible and long-lasting foothold in Nepal, but for the foisting 
  of wrong candidates by India, who then tarnished the word democracy itself.<br>
  <br>
  The first democratic adventure of Nepal was when the puppet king [Tribhuvan] 
  was restored to power in 1950. This happened with the nod of India. Such was 
  the clout of India in those days that if India had wanted the Ranas would have 
  continued as the de facto rulers of Nepal. On the other hand if India wanted 
  to annex Nepal it would also have been possible. But Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru 
  decided to let Nepal remain as a &quot;free&quot; nation. On hindsight, if India 
  had not intervened at that time an indigenous struggle may have been successful 
  in the ushering of a democratic regime through struggle, and not the one planted 
  by India. Both the Kingship and Ranaship may have been completely destroyed 
  through an indigenous struggle for democracy.<br>
  <br>
  India remained happy [at least on the outside] with Nepal's King Birendra till 
  1989, when India economically blockaded Nepal [March 1989 to April 1990]. Rumors 
  doing the rounds at that time were that Sonia Gandhi on a Kathmandu visit was 
  not allowed to visit the Pashupatinath temple on the ground that non-hindus 
  could not be allowed into the temple's sanctum sanctorum. This had apparently 
  piqued Rajiv Gandhi and led to the blockade. Others said that the blockade was 
  to teach Nepal a lesson for daring to purchase some arms from China and other 
  countries instead of only from India. Whatever be the actual reasons, on the 
  outside it was passed off as Nepal failing to sign two trade and transit treaties 
  with India after the expiry of the previous ones.<br>
  <br>
  The Indian blockade led to sky-rocketing prices of food, kerosene, oil, petrol 
  inside Nepal and the resultant anger of the common got directed towards the 
  King. These 13 months of immense hardship made people realize that the King, 
  who haplessly watched their suffering, was nothing but a tin pot dictator.<br>
  <br>
  At the same time the political parties and the people who led them got emboldened. 
  The final push came when the former Prime Minister of India, Chandrashekhar, 
  and known close family friend of the Koiralas, came to Kathmandu [Feb, 1990]. 
  From the garden of Ganeshman Singh's house, who afterwards got catapulted as 
  the supreme leader of Nepali Congress and supreme commander of the 1990 democratic 
  movement, Chandraskeshar publicly chastised the King and sang paeans of the 
  democrats.<br>
  <br>
  In his weakened state King Birendra, the absolute monarch, could do nothing. 
  This further emboldened the democrats and common people joined hands with them. 
  Daily rallies and protest meeting with the active participation of Nepalese 
  people from all walks of life started occurring almost spontaneously all over 
  Nepal. The movement reached its crescendo when the police fired on protesters 
  who dared to desecrate the statue of King Mahendra [Birendra's father]. At this 
  time tens of thousand of protesters were surging towards the heavily barricaded 
  royal palace, a couple of meters away. Dozens were martyred and King Birendra 
  decided to step down [April, 1990]. It was not that Chandrashekar's Kathmandu 
  sojourn that brought the downfall of absolute monarchy but certainly it added 
  momentum and hastened its end.<br>
  <br>
  In a way the embargo did well for Nepal's democracy, even though it resulted 
  in misery to the ordinary people. It is quite apparent that without India's 
  involvement (embargo plus emboldening the democrats) the movement would have 
  failed. India hoisted its favorites [the Nepali Congress stalwarts] to the top-posts 
  in Nepal.<br>
  <br>
  Once hoisted to the top, Indian prime ministers and top bureaucrats began to 
  build up false profiles of their favorite boys. P. V. Narshimha Rao and subsequent 
  Indian PMs publicly lauded Girija Prasad Koirala's and the late Ganeshman Singh's 
  role in the Indian freedom movement when in fact neither had taken part in the 
  Indian freedom struggle. At the same time India began to pump in hundreds of 
  crores of rupees to fund projects associated with the Koirala name.<br>
  <br>
  Most Nepalese had come to regard King Tribhuvan as the father of modern Nepal 
  but after democracy arrived in 1990, B. P. Koirala, the founder of Nepali Congress 
  Party, replaced Tribhuvan as the &quot;builder of modern Nepal&quot;. This was 
  hyped up even by the Indian media time and again [Ramchandra Guha, The Hindu, 
  July 21, 2001]. The royals were quickly sidelined and the Koiralas took over.<br>
  <br>
  The interference of Indian ambassadors in Nepal's daily political affairs has 
  ticked many. There are other prime ministerial candidates like Madhav Kumar 
  Nepal, General Secretary of United Maxist Leninist Party, who somehow always 
  gets pipped to the top post and there is a lot of suspicion amongst Nepalese 
  that this is because India wants to foist its blue-eyes boys only to the top 
  slot. Since this has happened repeatedly, it's now an old game which fools none 
  in Nepal; only generates ill-will to Nepal's big brother, India.<br>
  <br>
  Indians must have been really surprised when rumors that Indian film star, Hritikh 
  Roshan, had made disparaging comments about Nepal and Nepali people in an interview 
  to a TV network fueled rampaging crowds to target people of recent Indian origin 
  and their properties in 2000. In the backdrop of the big brotherly, couldn't 
  care less attitude that has been going on, this should be hardly surprising. 
  All Nepalese have a deep appreciation of the benefits that accrue due to the 
  special friendship between the two countries but resent interference down to 
  the point that India even chooses Nepalese PM.<br>
  <br>
  The gross insensitivity of the Indian politicians to the plight of Nepal can 
  be seen in the recent utterances of Yashwant Sinha, &quot;We have not bothered 
  about democracy elsewhere... so why are we so concerned about democracy in Nepal.&quot; 
  Of course, if his party BJP was still in power then perhaps the only Hindu king, 
  King Gyanendra of Nepal would not have faced such a hard time to convince an 
  Indian PM that his kind of 'democracy' and 'peace' and his illusive 'roadmap' 
  for Nepal are the best for Nepal and Nepalese.<br>
  <br>
  Since he came to the throne we have seen the many different animal-like characteristics 
  of Gyanendra. Two of the clearly identifiable ones are those of the hyena and 
  chameleon. He is dealing with Nepali people like a hyena, and in the international 
  arena behaves like a chameleon. He has tried all means: sam, dam, dand, bhed 
  [persuasion, carrots, sticks and divide respectively] that rulers since time 
  immemorial have used to rule. The only words that he is uttering these days 
  are jhut and chal [lies and tricks respectively]. The heady feeling of owning 
  an entire country and being at the center of international media attention seems 
  to be the reason why he is able to make all delusional lies. If the final [and 
  I might add the biggest weapon] in the form of India's support reaches him he 
  will certainly, break havoc on all those who fought for democracy and are therefore 
  naturally opposed to him. The tacit approval of India is already showing its 
  results.<br>
  <br>
  It is therefore in the best interests of the big-brother [India] and younger 
  brother [Nepal] relationships that the elder brother be extra sensitive to the 
  ground realities in Nepal and first actively promote democracy - the latent 
  desire of all Nepalese [and not monarchy] and secondly promote the democratic 
  movement [and not its blue-eyed boys]. For once, India should chart a new path 
  and help the Nepalese to choose their own leaders, and not choose it for them.</p>
<p class="text"><a name="77"></a>Parties Demand Full Restoration of Democracy</p>
<p class="text2">Arun<br>
  New Delhi May 3, 2005<br>
  <br>
  A six party coalition in Delhi has asked the outside community not to be confused 
  with the so-called lifting of emergency. The coalition says the royal government's 
  recent lifting of emergency has not brought about any change. The six political 
  parities had demanded the restoration of the duly elected House of Representatives 
  so that the constituent assembly could convene to address the restructuring 
  of the state, the outstanding socio-economic problems as well as the Maoist 
  insurgency.<br>
  <br>
  In a press release, the parties said, "The so-called lifting of emergency in 
  Nepal by King Gyanendra appears to have confused friends of democracy in Nepal, 
  India and abroad."<br>
  <br>
  The statement pointed out that political prisoners are still in jail, press 
  censorship remains, civil liberties are still suspended and the autocratic rule 
  of the king continues. It said that the irresponsible and illegal Royal Commission 
  continues to harass political leaders and activists. "We, therefore, strongly 
  condemn the attempt of King Gyanendra to hoodwink people at large, and earnestly 
  ask our friends everywhere to see through the new ploy of King Gyanendra," it 
  said. <br>
  <br>
  The parties said that the ever deepening problems of Nepal cannot be solved 
  without King Gyanendra surrendering every vestige of the power he has usurped 
  unconstitutionally. The restoration of the duly elected House of Representatives 
  can bring democracy back on track, they said.<br>
  <br>
  "Oppressed and restless Nepalese people are moving towards full democracy along 
  with the political parties in greater unity, cohesion and clarity everyday. 
  We are fully conscious of the need to concentrate and intensify the struggle 
  within Nepal," the press release said. "However, the support of the international 
  community and media are equally valuable to the ongoing struggle," it emphasized.<br>
  <br>
  While seeking the support of the outside community and world media, the parties 
  asked their supporters and well-wishers to have faith in the victory of full 
  democracy in Nepal in the near future. The statement was undersigned by the 
  following party leaders of the coalition:-<br>
  <br>
  Nepali Congress Krishna Prasad Sitaula<br>
  Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Rajan Bhattarai<br>
  Nepali Congress (Democratic) Pradip Giri<br>

<p class="text"><a name="76"></a>A Democratic Conundrum</p>
<p class="text2"><b>John Narayan Parajuli</b><br>
  Columbia, SC, April 30, 2005<br>
  <br>
  In the last week of Chaitra, we completed our fourteen years of theoretical 
  exercise in democracy. The number of "Jeffersonians in these hard times" who 
  came out to register their opposition to the king's rule was apparently the 
  biggest since Feb.1. However, the number is not the biggest or in any way at 
  par with pre-Feb. 1 demonstrations. This is partially due to the state of emergency 
  and partially because people aren't convinced that immediate restoration of 
  democracy alone is a panacea for our problems. <br>
  <br>
  Or, is it?<br>
  Like the chicken and the egg conundrum, the realpolitik of Nepal has seemingly 
  put two basic tenets of democracy one up against each other. Which should come 
  first - liberty or law and order? <br>
  The conventional wisdom says that both features compliment each other. They 
  are not mutually exclusive antagonists: both are quintessential. But, often, 
  ideals fail to anticipate constraints that may arise during their application. 
  Perhaps, that's what has happened in Nepal. Both the nation and the democratic 
  set-up that was ushered in some 15 years ago are at a crossroads. From here, 
  things threaten to degenerate further. This may be our best chance to review 
  our ideas about how we want to conduct our state business and, possibly, to 
  draw a much needed lesson from our democratic experience. <br>
  The rapid erosion of the rule of law in the last few years had already stripped 
  Nepal of an important aspect of the ideal democratic polity. The democratic 
  rights of people in the countryside have long been curtailed. Democracy is not 
  just for elites and those who live in cities or other power centers, is it? 
  Belatedly crying hoarse over the king's power grab, as some prefer to call it, 
  won't change the facts. <br>
  The armed Maoist insurgency that started in 1996 has exacted a heavy toll. A 
  small band of ragtag guerillas who intend to establish a communist state and 
  abolish the monarchy have grown so powerful that they have paralyzed the state's 
  machinery. This is not good news for those who care about the state as our common 
  entity, regardless of which party governs. The intensifying Maoist insurgency 
  has debilitated the state's hold throughout the country, thereby weakening its 
  ability to maintain a semblance of law and order, while those in the mainstream 
  did more to accentuate the decline than to reverse it. <br>
  Disagreements among the mainstream parties only perpetuated chaos. The king's 
  Feb.1 takeover of executive power to establish "peace and restore democracy" 
  is but the culmination of degenerating democratic polity in the country. The 
  royal putsch can be interpreted in a number of ways to suit one's own political 
  affiliation and other interests. To the idealist, it is a setback for democracy, 
  a regression. But, let's try to measure what happened on Feb. 1 against the 
  ground reality. I don't see any sincere Nepali - or even an outsider who is 
  familiar with the ground reality - not mellowing his tone. Just step outside 
  Kathmandu to get a feel for public sentiment. <br>
  It's easy for us at the commentariat to display our attack-dog journalism and 
  ignore the fact that the deteriorating law and order situation had come to the 
  point of no return-meaning a failed state. With so much of the system ailing, 
  a corrective measure had become, though undesirable for our democratic penchant, 
  both necessary and inevitable. The state's ill health, which the king outlined 
  in his takeover proclamation, is real, not made up. (Whether or not he has acted 
  in good faith is a different matter altogether.) <br>
  <br>
  What ails our system? <br>
  Immediately after being freed from the nearly forty days of house arrest following 
  the royal takeover of Feb.1, former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was again 
  back in action. While talking with journalists at his residence in Kathmandu, 
  he seized the moment to make another self-deprecating statement. In his blunt 
  style, Deuba blamed the media for Feb. 1. He gave the impression that whatever 
  "good" he had done during his premiership, he did from his personal pocket. 
  The debate on whether he did good or bad aside, Deuba's bites are representative 
  of the type of personalized administration our leaders ran since 1990. Institution 
  building or leaving a legacy was last on their agenda; instead, instability, 
  insecurity and mob-politics became institutionalized. Deuba's statement also 
  reflects what ails or ailed the parties and their leadership and the way their 
  narrow definition of democracy contributed significantly to the present chaos. 
  The king's contributions to the failure of the system are less obvious, while 
  most unverified conspiracy theories circulate every now and then. Yet, he clearly 
  missed an opportunity to right the wrongs when he immediately dissolved the 
  parliament in 2002 on the recommendation of the unthinking prime minister. Did 
  the king acted irrationally then? If not constitutional, was his Feb. 1 step 
  a logical recourse for a head of state? The response would include criticisms 
  of his tom hardiness, yet it would be unwise to think that the king is or was 
  ill informed or that he failed to grasp the severity of the crisis. <br>
  When King Gyanendra sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in February this 
  year for the second time in as many years, he certainly knew the risk he was 
  taking. He has removed Deuba twice from his office on charges of incompetence 
  and has also sought the resignation of two other prime ministers before Deuba. 
  He surely must be cognizant of the magnitude of the job he has assigned himself. 
  Amid the denunciation and support, the king's actions have stirred a debate: 
  liberty vs. security. <br>
  In reality, the big debate is not about which obligation of the state should 
  be the first priority. Most citizens agree that both are necessary in equal 
  measure. The debate is about which should prevail as a corrective measure if 
  they begin to step on each other's shoes. Should the state leave people to die 
  while allowing them their liberty, or should the state curtail some liberties 
  to ensure that lives are protected? Curtailing some liberties, some argue, enhances 
  the state's ability to identify bad guys from good guys. The logic is that the 
  more powerful the state grows, the more it can protect its law-abiding citizens. 
  There aren't many takers of this hypothesis. Without a shadow of doubt, the 
  increase in the state's power over the individual is a cause for alarm. But, 
  who said that this is the same world anymore? Post 9/11, like it or not, things 
  have changed everywhere. <br>
  Understandably, most Nepalis have been shocked, despite having had reasonable 
  warning, from former Minister Mohsin among others, of what was to befall. The 
  ambivalence is not new and not limited to Nepal. Even here in the United States 
  a subtle debate over security vs. liberty is going on. This might have been 
  unthinkable before September 11, but not any longer. At the heart of the discussion 
  is the issue of governmental access to personal data, and that's not all. <br>
  Since 9/11, America has overhauled its role in the world order as a self-appointed 
  prosecutor of terrorism. This maybe annoying to the rest of us, but that hasn't 
  deterred America's newfound globe-arching commitment to combat terrorism. Perhaps, 
  because of the experience borne out of post 9/11, Washington hasn't withdrawn 
  its military aid to Nepal, even when traditional allies like India and Britain 
  decided to do so after the royal takeover. A former US defense secretary and 
  an influential Republican recently told me that the US would continue the "military 
  to military relationship as far as practicable." He argued that maintaining 
  a military relationship can enhance American ability to influence changes in 
  any particular country. The American quid pro quo for continuing aid, according 
  to Cohen, is willingness in the military and the regime to commit to improve 
  its rights records. The Royal Nepal Army has already given a signal that it 
  is willing to come clean by speeding up the trial of a brigadier general. But, 
  securing backing for the three years that the king has declared his timeline 
  to return to democracy is going to be a tough job without visible progress. 
  <br>
  Apart from keeping the house in order, the king also needs to secure the backing 
  of the international community for the period of his rule. Keeping the house 
  in order will require him to handle mainstream dissidents more gently while 
  forming a "coalition of the willing." So far he has had little success in this 
  regard. <br>
  Beyond pointless rounds of mutual recriminations, apologists and critics of 
  both democracy and authoritarianism haven't been able to offer much. There is 
  no alternative to democracy, however, doubt persists that returning to it immediately, 
  as the international community and the mainstream parties are demanding, would 
  alone prove to be a panacea to our pressing woes. Some argue that a period of 
  "benign authoritarianism" will be helpful in engineering sustained improvement 
  in the security situation, provided that this is done in good faith. I am not 
  sure about the validity of this proposition, but what I am sure about is that 
  we chanted more democratic mantras and did less to preserve it: we have been 
  ignoring our problems at our own perils for too long. And, like everything else, 
  democracy has its price, which we blissfully chose to forget after it was restored 
  last time. <br>
  Democracy certainly isn't a magic wand, as we have experienced first-hand. Without 
  some sort of stability or a kind of normalcy, it's unlikely that it will be 
  strengthened in Nepal. This is neither advocating a military solution to the 
  other big problem, the Maoist insurgency, nor playing devil's advocate. However, 
  I am not in favor of allowing the state to be weakened as the talk for the talks 
  lingers. As a journalist, I want immediate restoration of democracy and the 
  basic rights. But as an individual, as a Nepali citizen, I am willing to give 
  the benefit of doubt to the king, though I am not big on allowing the royals 
  to run amok. <br>
  For obvious reason, this stopgap in our exercise of democracy (of elites only?) 
  is undesirable; nonetheless, it had become a necessity. It was only a question 
  of who was to execute it: the bitterly and hopelessly divided parties-who haven't 
  been able to renew their mandate to rule from the people-or the king. The parties 
  had their chance; shouldn't the king have his-to prove his competence? <br>
