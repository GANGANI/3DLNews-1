He was raised in Marshall, the second oldest of his parents&rsquo; eight children. Dale attended Marshall Schools and was a member of the Marshall High School graduating class of 1961. Dale was a talented athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball for the Marshall Redskins.<br />He attended Kellogg Community College and played basketball for the KCC Bruins. Dale started his 31 year career with Eaton Corporation in Marshall in 1963, using his earnings to help support all of his family. Dale retired from Eaton&rsquo;s in 1994, where he was a supervisor in the differential division.&nbsp;<br />But that was only his first retirement. Dale, ever active, then worked at numerous jobs, including with his friend Woody Dunham at Caleb Dunham Cheese, and for 10 years at the Kitchen Outlet Shop, from where he again retired in January of 2014.&nbsp;<br />Dale was married to Connie Blue in Homer in 1962. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1995.&nbsp;<br />Dale found love again, and was married to Jacqueline S. &ldquo;Jackie&rdquo; (Heddon) Warsop January 26, 2000.<br />He was a loving husband, father and grandfather. Dale remained very active with his son&rsquo;s families and loved every minute of it. The grandchildren got to experience Dale&rsquo;s legendary sense of humor, with all getting nicknames and adequate teasing! &nbsp;He was very proud of all of them.&nbsp;<br />Dale lived all of his life in Marshall and Homer. &nbsp;He continued with his love of athletics during his lifetime. He refereed both high school and collegiate basketball games for 25 years, and umpired girl&rsquo;s softball for eight years. Dale played softball and basketball in both Homer and Marshall adult leagues for many years. Dale religiously read the sports pages in the newspaper and retained what he read. He could tell you who played for who, when and their stats, if asked! He enjoyed watching all sports but in particular he liked Tiger baseball and MSU sports.&nbsp;<br />He loved to golf, and never turned down a chance for a golf outing! He played at Alwyn Downs in the Moose League and B &amp; E League. He was a member of Marshall Moose Lodge #676 for many years. While living in Homer, he was a member of the Homer United Methodist Church and had served as a trustee on the church board. Dale was a member of the Homer Athletic Boosters Club, where he will be remembered for his design of unique baseball uniforms for one season that his sons Tony and Nick wore proudly!</span><br /><span style="font-weight:normal">Dale is survived by his wife, Jackie; his sons and daughters-in-law, Tony and Kim Willis and Nick and Rebecca Willis, all of Homer; and Mitchell and Amie Willis of Midland; his seven grandchildren, Anna, Erin, Joey, Hayden, Devin, Garrett and Savanna Willis; his mother, Donna C.
