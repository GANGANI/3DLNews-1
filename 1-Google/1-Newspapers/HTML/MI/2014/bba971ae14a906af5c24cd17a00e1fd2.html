                            <p style="" align="left">Here’s to a new annual tradition – celebrating our region’s personalities and their stories. We’ve searched from Gaylord to Good Hart and from Manistee to Mackinac, and found dozens and dozens of individuals who qualify as "fascinating."</p>  <p style="" align="left">This list isn’t meant to be authoritative nor complete; but we do love to write and read about people like these – fascinating in our midst.</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890702653fa3712e7d77.png" border="0/"></p>  <p style="" align="left">JAN PRICE </p><p style="" align="left">Empire</p>  <p style="" align="left">Nurse, Pastor</p>  <p style="" align="left">Growing up, Jan Price had two great passions: medicine and sports. She wanted to be a doctor, but instead followed the advice of a doctor friend and mentor.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"He said, "˜You know what? You’re smart enough to be a doctor. But it’s a crappy lifestyle for a woman,’" said Price.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Ignoring that assessment, she became an intensive care unit charge nurse at Munson Medical Center in Traverse City, and she loves it.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Price went to school before Title IX, the rule mandating equal opportunities for boys’ and girls’ sports in high school.</p>  <p style="" align="left">So she channeled her enthusiasm in different directions: She waterskied on summer mornings before her dad went to work when "the lake was like glass." She was the first certified female ski instructor at Sugarloaf. When her kids were growing up, she took up mountain biking.</p>  <p style="" align="left">She still has the competitive edge: Last year she came in first in her age group in the M-22 challenge.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Yet something more beckoned her. A few years ago, she decided to forge ahead with another long-held goal: to become a pastor.</p>  <p style="" align="left">She’s now pastor of adult discipleship at Glen Lake Community Reformed Church.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Although in two distinct areas, Price says that her jobs have common ground.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We have a great team at Munson. We have great docs. My coworkers are the best nurses," she said. "We give the best care but the outcome is up to God."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890702753fa3713d297c.png" border="0/"></p><p style="" align="left">JESSICA POCIASK </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Owner, Want Expeditions</p><p style="" align="left">Jessica Pociask always wanted to see the world.</p>  <p style="" align="left">So far, so good: She’s traveled to almost 80 countries.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Her thirst for travel and adventure started at an early age.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"All
 my aunts and uncles on my father’s side traveled extensively," she 
said. "Their stories, combined with my grandfather’s musty collection of
 National Geographic magazines and my copy of Richard Halilburtons "˜Book
 of Marvels,’ which told tales of far off exotic lands with ancient 
ruins, incredible wildlife, and untouched tribes, made me dream of being
 an explorer." Pociask has guided trips for the Wild life</p>  <p style="" align="left">Conservation
 Society and Michigan State Alumni Association. In 2006, she was one of 
50 women chosen by the National Wildlife Federation to participate in 
the Women’s Leadership and International Sustainable Development 
conference in Washington, D.C.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Last year she was one of the keynote speakers at the Wildlife Conservation Film Festival in New York City.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Pociask
 began her travels young, going overseas at age 16 as a violinist in the
 Young Ambassadors program, and then to Antarctica while at Michigan 
State University to study climate change.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Those trips, and her background in biology, led her to launch her company.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Pociask
 spends an average of six months a year overseas, and she often uses her
 company as a platform for projects that empower women. She’s now 
working on a project with Mothering Across Continents to empower groups 
of at-risk young women from Las Vegas.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We
 take them to Liberia to interact with local women’s organizations, an 
orphanage for girls, and members of Parliament," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890702853fa3714a220e.png" border="0/"></p><p style="" align="left">KEVIN RHODES </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Music Director, Traverse Symphony Orchestra</p>  <p style="" align="left">Kevin Rhodes is well known to Traverse City audiences as the man on the podium at Traverse Symphony Orchestra concerts. For more than 10 years he has served as the music director at the symphony.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Prior to moving north, he and his wife lived in Europe for ten years, where he orchestrates at opera houses across the continent. The repertoire ranged from the operas of Strauss, Verdi, Puccini, and Mozart to the ballets of Prokofiev, Bartok and Tchaikovsky.</p>  <p style="" align="left">They returned stateside in 2001 to be closer to family. His mother-in-law had moved to Northern Michigan, and when they saw an ad seeking a new music director for the symphony, he applied.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We hit it off," he said simply.</p><p style="" align="left">That same year, Rhodes became the symphony music director in Springfield, Mass., and later became conductor of the Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra of Boston. He splits his time among all three positions as well as continuing as a guest conductor in Europe.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He also finds time to play piano, which he majored in at Michigan State University. Yet he’s not completely insulated from other musical genres.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"As a performer, my metier is classical," he said. "I’m not a jazz pianist, but I love listening to it – Oscar Peterson, Gil Evans. Pop of different eras, like the Black Eyed Peas, Outkast, Gnarles Barkley, that kind of stuff I enjoy."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Outside the music sphere, Rhodes’ focus is otherworldly.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I watch "˜Star Trek,’" Rhodes said. He explained that traveling frequently for a living necessitates a certain amount of down time.</p>  <p style="" align="left">So he and his wife watch movies, enjoy life, and, yes, watch "Star Trek."</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Like Spock would say, "˜Fascinating,’" said Rhodes.</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890728153fa38119f5e6.png" border="0/"></p><p style="" align="left">ERIK AFTON </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Cashier, Salvation Army volunteer</p>  <p style="" align="left">Erik Afton knows how bad holidays can be for some.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Growing
 up in a single parent household, he and his brother benefited from the 
efforts of the Salvation Army in his hometown of Holland. So he began 
giving back at an early age.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I’ve been bell ringing since I was 16, starting in Holland," he said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 Salvation Army bell ringers herald the Christmas season. No matter the 
weather, Afton and his colleagues are ready with a smile and a thank you
 for anyone putting money into the shiny red kettles.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Being a bell-ringer, that’s fun," he said. <br></p><p style="" align="left">Afton is such an 
enthusiastic proponent of the holiday collecting effort that he often 
takes 10-hour shifts – five times the length of most of those minding 
the kettles.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Not only 
does he come from a background that was less than luxurious, there have 
been times in his adult life where he was out of work as well, and 
largely dependent upon the kindness of others.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I was unemployed for two or three years," he said. "I know what it’s like to pound the pavement and come home without a job."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Afton currently works as a cashier at Walmart, and his wife Susie is the youth development coordinator at the Salvation Army.</p>  <p style="" align="left">When not at work or doing his volunteering, Afton can often be found outdoors, hiking, fishing, and even gardening.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 love fishing, and traveling around the Grand Traverse area," he said. 
"It’s really cool, there are lots of neat places tucked away."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890728353fa38136af97.png" border="0/"></p>  <p style="" align="left">CHRISTOPHER WRIGHT</p>  <p style="" align="left">Topinabee Author</p>  <p style="" align="left">You
 probably heard Christopher Wright before you read his works. The 
multi-talented author of the Chillers book series had a career as a 
DJ/voiceover artist, most notably at KHQ radio, where he spun tunes as 
Christopher Knight.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Now
 living in Topinabee, he still lends his voice out on occasion. But most
 of the time, he’s focused on running his Chillers publishing empire his
 other career as an adult fiction writer.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 Chillers series is a monster. Under Wright’s pen name, Jonathan Rand, 
19 Michigan Chillers books based in cities around the mitten have been 
published, with titles like "Dinosaurs Destroy Detroit" and "Mayhem on 
Mackinac Island."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Their
 success inspired Wright to start the American Chillers novels; he’s 
written 41 of those, and will write one for each U.S. state.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But the whole thing almost never happened.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"When
 I pitched the idea to publishers, none were interested," Wright said. 
"One company sent me a rejection letter telling me that "˜Kids aren’t 
reading books like this any more.’" Wrong. The series now boasts more 
than 37 million readers in 24 countries, and the books are carried by a 
wide range of bookstores, 196 Meijer locations, and at Wright’s own 
"Chillermania World Headquarters" in Indian River.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He’s
 also completed three adult novels, one of which is currently being 
adapted into a film ("Bestseller"), and has started two other youth 
reader series, the Freddie Fernortner books and The Adventure Club.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Ambition is not something Wright is lacking.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 do enjoy earning a living writing books," he said. "But I think the 
most rewarding part is knowing that I’ve helped foster a love of 
reading. There’s no paycheck in the world that can replace that."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890728453fa381451ae0.png" border="0/"></p><p style="" align="left">JOHN MULL </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Chief Flight Paramedic, North Flight</p>  <p style="" align="left">Excitement is not what North Flight’s Chief Flight Paramedic John Mull is looking for.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"If
 it’s exciting, I’m doing something very wrong," said Mull, who has 
logged thousands of hours during hundreds of air rescue and transfer 
flights. "It’s interesting, don’t get me wrong.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But
 it’s the patient who is having an exciting day. They’ve generally had a
 pretty bad day when they see us. It’s not like you see on TV; it’s not 
always trauma drama. But my job is always interesting."</p>  <p style="" align="left">In
 1986, Mull started in North Flight’s Ground Division. He soon 
transferred to the Air Division, which utilizes helicopters and a fixed 
wing airplane to transport patients all over the state and nation.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Sometimes
 patients are lifted directly from accident scenes, sometimes they are 
transfers from Munson Medical Center to other hospitals. All require 
care and expert training from Mull and his co-workers.</p><p style="" align="left">The
 Massachusetts native has a family legacy of grace under pressure. His 
grandfather was a medic in World War I, his father a pilot in World War 
II.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Like most 
emergency personnel, Mull’s work schedule is not a typical 9-5 gig. He 
works two days a week: a 24-hour shift and a 12-hour shift.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We’re scheduled for 72 hours every two weeks," he said. "But in reality we probably average 90 hours plus."</p>  <p style="" align="left">That
 left Mull plenty of time to pursue another activity: Indy Car racing. 
Starting in 1986, he spent 20 years serving as a member of an Indy Car 
Safety Team, often working as the crew chief. Those are the guys who 
scramble to the scene of a crash.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He’s been to more than 250 Indy Car races, including events in Australia, Japan, Mexico and all over the U.S.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I’m
 the old man at North Flight now," he said with a smile. "But I love it.
 I absolutely love what I do, flying over Northern Michigan. I can’t 
imagine not doing it."</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 do enjoy earning a living writing books," he said. "But I think the 
most rewarding part is knowing that I’ve helped foster a love of 
reading. There’s no paycheck in the world that can replace that."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890728253fa3812986fd.png" border="0/"></p>  <p style="" align="left">CHUCK PFARRER </p><p style="" align="left">Bellaire</p>  <p style="" align="left">Author, Screenwriter</p>  <p style="" align="left">Though he lives relatively quietly in Antrim County now, Chuck Pfarrer has led a high-octane professional life.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 burly, bearded Bellaire resident is a U.S. Navy SEAL veteran of more 
than 150 combat missions in the Middle East, including the capture of 
Abu Abbas and the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, as well as
 tours in the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Earlier this month, Pfarrer – the bestselling author of "SEAL Target Geronimo:</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 Inside Story of the Mission to Kill Osama bin Laden" – spent two weeks 
in Afghanistan working as a consultant with the Afghan Air Force.</p>  <p style="" align="left">In Central America, he served as a military advisor and counter-narcotics operator.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Pfarrer ended his active military career as a commander with the Navy’s famed SEAL Team Six.</p>  <p style="" align="left">As
 a civilian, Pfarrer spent more than a decade in Hollywood, where he 
wrote in a bungalow that once belonged to Lucille Ball. He wrote 
screenplays for "The Jackal," "Virus," "Navy SEALs," "Darkman," "Hard 
Target," and the science fiction thriller "Red Planet."</p>  <p style="" align="left">His autobiography, "Warrior Soul: The
 Memoir of a Navy SEAL," is in its 13th printing and continues to top 
Amazon’s military history bestseller lists. He’s currently finishing a 
historical novel about the U.S. Navy battling Mediterranean pirates in 
the 19th century.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Pfarrer’s
 opinion pieces have appeared in the New York Times and the Knight 
Ridder syndicate. He’s been seen as an author and counter-terrorism 
expert on CS- PAN, NPR, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox-TV.</p>  <p style="" align="left">As
 a correspondent for Breitbart Media, Pfarrer has covered NATO forces in
 Afghanistan. Earlier this month, Pfarrer returned to Southwest Asia as 
one of the first correspondents to embed on combat missions with the 
Afghan Air Force.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He has also written extensively on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the subsequent government cover up.</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890790053fa3a7cb40c5.png" border="0/" height="390" width="551"></p><p style="" align="left">CARTER SCHMIDT </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">CEO, Carter’s Compost</p>  <p style="" align="left">He’s not quite on the Fortune 500 list, but the CEO of Carter’s Compost in Traverse City has other things on his mind.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Starting
 fifth grade next week, for one. Two years ago, Carter Schmidt – with a 
little help from dad Ty – launched Carter’s Compost with a bike, some 
buckets and a bit of boyhood enthusiasm. (We’re talking lots of worms 
here.)</p>  <p style="" align="left">After two years
 fine-tuning customer service, money management and team building 
skills, Carter Schmidt is now an expert in turning kitchen scraps into 
killer compost.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He has
 55 household and business customers – picking up their kitchen scraps 
weekly on two wheels through heat, rain and snow – but overall has 
helped more than 110 different households and businesses compost in two 
years.</p>  <p style="" align="left">He’s also 
inspired many in his community to "green up" their own waste streams by 
creating their own compost piles or by using a community station like 
the one at Oryana.</p>  <p style="" align="left">His ultimate goal: To bring bike-powered, youth-driven community composting to all of TC.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But
 one boy (and now his younger brother) couldn’t do it all. This past 
year, Carter supported four other kids in starting up their own 
neighborhood composting services.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Max
 and Amelia in Central Neighborhood, Jack in Traverse Heights and 
William in Oak Park," he said. "But we need more!" Carter was named 
Grand Traverse County’s "Recycler of the Year" in 2013, was recently 
featured in a trade magazine for the U.S.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Compost Council, and successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign for his business.</p>  <p style="" align="left">More
 recently, he launched a partnership with American Waste and a "CSA by 
Bike" program collaborating with local farmers for in-town deliveries.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Our
 next goal is to help build 100 Community Compost Stations in TC to 
bring more piles to more backyards," said Carter Schmidt. "We think pile
 sharing is the best kind of sharing."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890790153fa3a7db98d7.png" border="0/" height="368" width="551"></p><p style="" align="left">STEPHEN BREDE </p><p style="" align="left">Petoskey</p>  <p style="" align="left">Canoeist</p>  <p style="" align="left">Canoeist Stephen Brede understands the appeal of paddling around a lake on a sunny day.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But Brede, who has canoed around lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, is much more familiar with less favorable conditions.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Now tackling Lake Superior this summer and next, Brede said he was inspired by another legendary paddler.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 first considered it after reading about the late Verlen Kruger, who 
paddled more than 100,000 miles throughout the Americas," Brede said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Inspired, Brede left his job with Harbor House Publishers, bought a used Kruger canoe on Craigslist, and he was off.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 obstacles have been many. Wind, waves, mosquitos, and biting flies. He 
got sciatica on Lake Huron. Strained his shoulder on Lake Michigan. 
Paddled through record heat on Lake Erie. And got Lyme disease and 
shingles on Lake Ontario.</p>  <p style="" align="left">His
 dedicated wife, Ruth, is a nurse, so she oversees his health as well as
 providing emotional support, often driving thousands of miles to meet 
him onshore as he perseveres.</p>  <p style="" align="left">And he ends each trip right where he starts it.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Henry
 David Thoreau said a true walk is when you don’t retrace your steps," 
Brede said, "So I think about these trips in that way. Traveling under 
my own power is awesome and humbling. And I now see water, something I 
used to take for granted, as most precious."</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890790253fa3a7ee0755.png" border="0/" height="497" width="556"></p><p style="" align="left">KEVIN MCDONOUGH </p><p style="" align="left">Beaver Island</p>  <p style="" align="left">Captain, Beaver Island Boat Company</p>  <p style="" align="left">Beaver Island hosts two each of lighthouses, campgrounds, and museums, plus seven inland lakes and six restaurants.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But there’s only one Kevin McDonough, the Beaver Island boat captain who’s been working on the ferries for a whopping 44 years.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Captain
 McDonough is also one of only around 600 year-round residents on the 
53-square-mile island. He’s lived there his entire life.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 biggest island in Lake Michigan got its start as a bustling fishing 
port in the 19th century. McDonough got his start by working the docks.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 started at Beaver Island Boat Company in 1970 as a summer deckhand," 
McDonough said. "I became a full-time deckhand/captain in 1973. I became
 the senior captain nearly 21 years ago."</p>  <p style="" align="left">McDonough
 traverses the 32 watery miles between mainland Charlevoix and Beaver 
Island regularly; the wheelhouse is his office. But in spite of 44 years
 doing the same job, he says no two days are ever the same.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Weather,
 people, cargo – they’re always changing," he said. "It is still a 
fantastic job. Seeing the same people year after year is special." The 
main challenge is making sure the boats and crew are 100 percent ready, 
every time the boat leaves the dock.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"There are endless mechanical systems to maintain," he said. "And the crew must be trained in many fields."</p>  <p style="" align="left">It’s definitely a team effort. And well worth it for McDonough.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We
 have a great crew, dock, and office personnel," he said. "What I like 
best is being able to live on Beaver Island and raise my children 
there."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Though he loves the Great Lakes and what he does, there is an end in sight to McDonough’s career.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I plan to step down as senior captain in a few years," he said. "But I will always try to stay close to the water."</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890842053fa3c841f554.png" border="0/"></p><p style="" align="left">KERRI FINLAYSON</p>  <p style="" align="left">Petoskey Professor, North Central Michigan College</p>  <p style="" align="left">There
 are athletes, and there are extreme athletes. Petoskey anthropology/ 
sociology professor Kerri Finlayson identifies with the latter.</p>  <p style="" align="left">She’s
 climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, bicycled through Africa, and cross-country 
skied to the North Pole. Many people might stop at one of these 
achievements, but for Finlayson, it’s a way of life.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"The
 appeal is multi-dimensional," Finlayson said. "Part of it is 
experiencing other cultures. The other dimension is physical – I have a 
desire to see where my limits are."</p>  <p style="" align="left">She
 found those limits during an attempt to climb up Mt. Rainier, where, 
roped to her fellow climbers, she tried to carry 60 pounds of gear 
across a hardened layer of icy mud.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"It was incredibly painful," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"The
 helmet pushed into my backpack so I couldn’t move my head, and the 
heavy plastic mountaineering boots produced a sharp pain with each step.
 I had the feeling that anyone could take a misstep and cause our whole 
team to hang on for dear life."</p>  <p style="" align="left">But teamwork is part of why she continues onward.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"You have to trust yourself and put faith in your teammates," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The next challenge on Finlayson’s radar is marriage, to Crooked Tree Breadworks proprietor Greg Carpenter.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"It’ll
 be a unique experience to do expeditions together, as I’ve only done 
them either on my own or with girlfriends," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Marriage probably won’t slow this adventurous athlete down.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I’d
 like to climb the highest spots in each of our 50 states, mountain bike

 grew up in a small village in Slovenia, well known for its spa 
facilities. When he was a boy, Princess Vicky, daughter of England’s 
Queen Victoria, visited the spa, and carried out the custom of royalty 
to bring exotic plants as gifts.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Three
 seedlings from the Princess’ visit were planted in Dr. Gustav Uhlich’s 
town. They grew up into redwood trees, and he found them "simply 
beautiful."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Now a 
Petoskey resident and respected gastroenterologist, Uhlich’s favor of 
the redwood continues today, further inspired by Julia Butterfly Hill, 
the environmentalist who lived in a tree in California in the late "˜90s 
to protest logging.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Her story helped show me we can all do something to help our environment," Uhlich said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Along
 with his friend, landscaper Richard Hoffman, he’s spearheading a 
movement to get redwood trees planted in Northern Michigan.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"These
 are ornamental trees with a very good immune system, with protective 
chemicals in their sap," he said. "Being a doctor, this was of 
particular interest to me."</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 redwoods also do a good job of protecting the environment, and can help
 replace the many weaker trees in Michigan that are dying due to disease
 and bugs like the emerald ash borer, he said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Let’s
 add this tree that can live for up to 2,000 years, and see if that 
helps," Uhlich said. "We have to adapt to keep our ecosystem stable."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Uhlich
 first tried to grow mountain redwoods, but last winter’s harsh 
temperatures killed them. So he moved on to the dawn redwood, a more 
hardy variety that he hopes locals will purchase and plant.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"If
 something goes wrong, you don’t give up," he said. "You nurture these 
trees a little, and hopefully they will grow for years. It’s another way
 of finding purpose in your life."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890842153fa3c85c0987.png" border="0/"></p>  <p style="" align="left">JIM GILLESPIE </p><p style="" align="left">Petoskey</p>  <p style="" align="left">Executive Director, Blissfest Music Organization</p><p style="" align="left">Who knew that a tiny, 
one-day festival put on by Jim Gillespie and his Grain Train coworkers 
in 1981 would morph into the massive undertaking that Blissfest is 
today?</p>  <p style="" align="left">"No one could 
have imagined where Blissfest would be back then, but that’s all part of
 the BlissStory," Gillespie said with a laugh.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Now
 executive director of Petoskey’s Blissfest Music Organization – a far 
cry from the hand-lettered poster and tied-yarn "˜wristbands’ of the 
original fest – Gillespie has been at the helm of this most popular 
Northern Michigan music and arts event for almost 34 years.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Back in college, Gillespie discovered stringed instruments and American roots music when
 he changed majors from pre-med to anthropology. While he’d always had a
 passion for music, these new sounds really took hold.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"When
 I moved back to Petoskey after 10 years of higher education with two 
degrees and long hair, the Grain Train had a ready-made community of 
folks to plug into," he said. "Blissfest developed the same way, pulling
 from the hippie traditions that helped the food co-op movement."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Once Blissfest "happened," though, it would take 12 years for it to make any money.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But Gillespie said he has always been "one of those plodding types who gets stuck on something and slowly rides it to infinity."</p>  <p style="" align="left">With
 Blissfest, that determination paid off. "I have been able to stay with 
the organization because of perseverance, and the passion I have for the
 transformative power of music and culture," he said. "Plus it has 
become a big reunion of sorts. I still say to this day that Blissfest is
 just a family gathering with 5,000 of my closest friends."</p>  <p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890842253fa3c86950d8.png" border="0/" height="653" width="546"></p><p style="" align="left">BILL "BEAR" FOWLER </p><p style="" align="left">Peshawbestown</p>  <p style="" align="left">Owner, 1836 Fish Company</p><p style="" align="left">For
 thousands of anglers, fishing is a relaxing hobby. But for commercial 
fisherman Bill "Bear" Fowler, it’s both a demanding career and a 
political statement.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Fowler
 owns and operates the 1836 Fish Company, named after the treaty in 
which the Ottawa and Chippewa nations ceded land to the federal 
government in exchange for preserving the tribe’s hunting and fishing 
rights. Based on that agreement, tribal members, including Fowler, have 
the rights to a portion of the fish in Lake Michigan where Fowler 
operates three large boats most every day.</p>  <p style="" align="left">For
 Fowler and his crews, fishing is much more than a job, it’s a 
lifestyle. Some days they’re on the water for up to 20 hours. They’re 
sometimes on the water as early as 3am and don’t return until dark, 
depending on the weather. His netting operation is one of the largest in
 the region.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The crews
 fish primarily for lake trout and whitefish, but once in a while 
they’ll take salmon, walleye or perch. On a good day, the 1836 Fish 
Company can bring in up to 4,000 whitefish, most of which are sold to 
Carlson’s, the venerable fishery at Fishtown in Leland. While the market
 for whitefish and salmon has been strong recently, there are still 
concerns. Fish are less abundant, and invasive species, especially the 
looming threat of Asian Carp, are always a concern.</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890934853fa40247f744.jpg" border="0/" height="379" width="539"></p><p style="" align="left">MELISSA SALEH </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Educator
 Someday in her long-off retirement, Melissa Saleh planned to head off 
to a Third World country with her husband to teach underprivileged 
children.</p>  <p style="" align="left">But there’s 
been a change of plans. The Traverse City couple, both in their 50s, 
decided to pull the trigger now. And they won’t trek to Africa, but to 
Hamtramck -- one of the country’s most diverse cities (some 100 
languages are spoken there).</p>  <p style="" align="left">"When
 we visited Detroit for the first time three years ago, we didn’t think 
we needed to go the Third World because Detroit is equally in need," Melissa said.<br></p>  <p style="" align="left">Melissa,
 who taught at The Pathfinder School last year, was born into a poor 
family in British Guyana. Still, her mother found a way to open a 
secretarial school and award scholarships to kids growing up in 
dysfunctional homes.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I guess she was my role model. If you’ve got enough for your own life, there’s no point in acquiring more," Melissa said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Melissa’s
 husband, Abdul, moved from Yemen to New York City at the age of seven 
and, while neither of his parents attended even a day of school, they made sure
 Abdul and his brother did.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Melissa
 also taught kids of well-heeled Silicon Valley executives a few years 
ago while Abdul earned a graduate degree in genetics. She also taught 
Somali school kids in Tucson.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The couple will open a storefront in Hamtramck on Sept. 1 and return to their Traverse City home when they can.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"It’s a magnificent place, but we’re not ready to retire here," Abdul said.</p><div align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140890887553fa3e4b3c3e1.png" border="0/" height="357" width="528"></div><p style="" align="left">LOU KASISCHKE </p><p style="" align="left">Good Hart</p>  <p style="" align="left">Author, Mountaineer, Attorney</p>  <p style="" align="left">The
 date May 10, 1996 forever shaped Good Hart resident Lou Kasischke’s 
life. That was the day, while on the face of Mt. Everest, Kasischke 
decided to descend to safety while several others in his party elected 
to make for the summit.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Eight
 people, including Kasischke’s friends, wound up caught in a ferocious 
blizzard and died. The event was immortalized in Jon Krakauer’s book 
Into Thin Air.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"At 
first I made the decision to return to the top along with the others, 
which was the wrong decision," Kasischke said. "The only inner voice 
that was talking to me was all about me, and my goal and my ambition and
 my achievements and so forth, then all the focus was on just me and 
what I think of as the dark side of ambition. Ambition can kill you, and
 it almost did."</p>  <p style="" align="left">It’s taken almost two decades, but Kasischke is finally ready to tell his story in his own book, After the Wind.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The book is a love letter to his wife; he decided to publish it after she became ill, he said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"In
 the end, I published it as an expression of my love and thanks to my 
wife, Sandy, for her role in what happened," he said. "She’s doing

wake at all.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The question is why. Physician Terrie Taylor has devoted 28 years to this deadly mystery.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Malawi remains in the belly of the beast when it comes to malaria," she said. "It’s a major scourge."</p>  <p style="" align="left">The World Health Organization estimates cerebral malaria causes 600,000 deaths each year, mostly young children.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Interviewed
 at her Traverse City home, Terrie Taylor talked excitedly about a 
profound breakthrough, thanks to the gift of an MRI machine in 2008.</p>  <p style="" align="left">With it, the team could compare brains of those who died to survivors.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We clearly saw the deaths were all in kids with the swollen brains," Taylor said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The reason: the enlarged brain presses upon the spinal cord area that regulates breathing.</p>  <p style="" align="left">These
 findings are under review by a medical journal. If accepted, Taylor 
will come a step closer to the Nobel Prize on top of her many other 
awards.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Terrie has a 
rare capacity to persist," said Malcolm Molyneux, a physician and fellow
 researcher. "She is creative in thinking about the challenges thrown up

Project, as distinguished professor at MSU, and at home in Traverse

 clothes to kill parasites that might otherwise lay eggs in her skin.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Her next goal: discovering how to treat malaria victims with swollen brains.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"Then I’ll think about retiring," Taylor said.</p><p style="" align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140891052953fa44c1e5024.png" border="0/" height="564" width="549"></p><p style="" align="left">JACKIE KASCHEL </p><p style="" align="left">Traverse City</p>  <p style="" align="left">Founder and Executive Director, Peace Ranch</p>  <p style="" align="left">For
 Jackie Kaschel, the road to Peace Ranch began anything but peacefully. 
She and her husband Paul had adopted sisters who had been severely 
abused and neglected, and they were running out of ways in which to 
reach them.</p>  <p style="" align="left">The 
couple, both therapists, had met while working at a residential facility
 in New Hampshire that was a working farm. They remembered how the 
rhythm of life there had brought structure to people’s lives, so they 
decided to try it for themselves.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"We bought property in Hoosier Valley to build a family farm," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">While
 working at Horse North Rescue in Kingsley, Jackie realized that working
 with horses could also serve as therapy for people. That led her to 
re-cast the family farm with rescued horses getting the attention they 
needed while providing the same for people.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I thought we’d just add this. I didn’t know it would become an organization," she said.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Kaschel says horses are prey animals, not predators, who respond to non-verbal communication.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"People
 may tell me they are comfortable around horses, but their body tells me
 they’re uncomfortable," she said. "If the person is feeling anxiety, 
the horse will mirror it and move away."</p>  <p style="" align="left">That
 gives them an opportunity to talk about what is going on with the 
horse, and often allows the person to admit to their own anxiety.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Today
 Peace Ranch serves as a therapy facility for more than a dozen rescued 
horses. Its Equine Assisted Psychotherapy and Equine Assisted Learning 
sessions are open to children and adults of diverse backgrounds. It also
 recently began an Equine Assisted Veterans Services (EAVS) pilot 
program for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><div align="left"><img src="https://af62359ed6764b37dd8d-a09ab6654f67c1c7801ec2e0698b9db1.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/legacy_images/Northernexpress-08-25-2014/lib/140891053053fa44c2eaa8a.png" border="0/" height="579" width="532"></div><p style="" align="left">CHARLES EISENDRATH </p><p style="" align="left">Wordsmith and Grillmaster</p>  <p style="" align="left">Boyne City/Ann Arbor Journalism professor, Director, Knight-Wallace Fellows at University of Michigan</p>  <p style="" align="left">Mike
 Wallace used to grill people on CBS’s "60 Minutes." Charles Eisendrath 
prefers to keep his journalism and grilling separate.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Eisendrath
 has written for radio and TV news programs, papers like the Baltimore 
Evening Sun, New York Times, and Chicago Tribune, and for Time magazine,
 which posted him to London, Paris and Buenos Aires.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Now
 a professor at the University of Michigan, he’s the founding director 
of the Livingston Awards for Young Journalists and the director of the 
Knight Wallace Fellows.</p>  <p style="" align="left">And
 he invented the Grillery, a high-end grill sought after by celebrities 
such as noted gastronome James Beard and Chef Bobby Flay.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Eisendrath got his journalism start the old-fashioned way: by getting help from a family friend.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"For
 the only time in my life I asked for pull from my family," he said. "My
 dad had catalogued the art collection for Joe Pulitzer. He [Pulitzer] 
said we’ll find something for him."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Eisendrath ended up with Pulitzer’s St. Louis Post- Dispatch.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I
 fell in love with journalism," he said. Following his stints abroad 
with Time magazine, he became a journalism professor at Michigan. When 
the university decided to cut funding for and essentially eliminate its 
journalism program, he raised what is currently a $57 million endowment.</p>  <p style="" align="left">Eisendrath
 splits his time between Ann Arbor and his farm in the East Jordan area.
 It was there he created a grill with an adjustable cooking surface, 
inspired by his time in Argentina, France and Turkey.</p>  <p style="" align="left">It
 cooks directly over the fire, perfect for Eisendrath, who calls himself
 "an A-type personality who gets bored waiting for charcoal to heat up."</p>  <p style="" align="left">Today
 Eisendrath’s son Ben heads Grillworks. The grills, which range from 
just under $2,000 to nearly $14,000, have been written up in magazines

appeal to multiple religions is also exemplified by her standing in for 
Muslims at the celebration of Martin Luther King Day at the State

 appeal to other traditions is so strong she was named Ministering 
Spiritual Leader of the non-denominational Unitarian Universalist 
Congregation of Grand Traverse. Having a rabbi leading such a fellowship
 might seem pretty unconventional to the outside world, but Bahle has a 
long history there.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"I’ve been good friends with the church," she said, having been a guest preacher there for more than 20 years.</p>  <p style="" align="left">"There’s an overlap in values, ideals and ways of wanting to heal the world."</p>  <p style="" align="left">It’s
 that overlap in so many religious traditions that appeals to her, and 
why she felt she could head up the Unitarian Universalist Congregation. 
"I spent many months consulting with my colleagues on this," she said,
