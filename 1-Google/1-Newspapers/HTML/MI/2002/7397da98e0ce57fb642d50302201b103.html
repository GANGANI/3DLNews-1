    				<h1>Riding with the Outlaws -- Michigan Toughest Biker Outfit has a New Home in Alba</h1>
                    
                        
                        
    					    <h6>May 29, 2002</h6>
                        
                        
                        I glanced over at Leroy. His enormous hands were gripping the steering<br>wheel of his plush conversion van. He was wearing oversized gold rings on<br>almost every finger. A thick gold chain hung around his neck in stark<br>contrast to his blue jeans and black sweatshirt embroidered with various<br>cryptic emblems. Dark wraparound glasses concealed his eyes. His gold rings<br>glowed dully in the overcast morning light. We had met five minutes<br>earlier, and now Leroy was telling me all about being an Outlaw.<br>     T.A., the President of the Michigan Outlaws Motorcycle Club, had arranged<br>everything a week earlier. He called me because I had left a note on the<br>door of the Outlaws‘ clubhouse in Saginaw asking for an interview. It was a<br>long shot, but how else does one get in touch with a motorcycle club?<br>They‘re not listed in the yellow pages.<br>    T.A. said he wanted to do the interview, but he was very busy. He‘s Kid<br>Rock‘s personal tour security guard, “the last person you have to get<br>through before you get to Kid,“ and he had to be in Indianapolis to protect<br>Kid from overzealous groupies and other hangers-on. He told me to call him<br>back in a week when we would arrange a date for me to come to his house in<br>Northern Michigan so he could show me all of his Outlaws memorabilia.<br><br>WEARING COLORS<br>   A week later, on our way to meet T.A., Leroy and I stopped for a quick<br>lunch at Avery‘s in Mancelona. A local sheriff eyed Leroy as we walked to<br>our table. The Outlaws patches and logo on his sweatshirt were a dead<br>giveaway. He was in a biker “gang.“  Leroy seemed not to notice. Outlaws<br>wear their colors with pride, and no small town sheriff was going to stop<br>Leroy from feeling just as welcome as the senior citizens eating their soup<br>and sandwiches. Like all other Outlaws, Leroy is a “1%er,‘ and they do<br>things differently than everybody else. We ate quickly, as diners sneaked<br>surreptitious glances our way. And then it was off to T.A.‘s, 18 miles up<br>the road.<br>    Originally from Sterling Heights, T.A. moved his family to Northern<br>Michigan years ago to get away from the city. Now he makes his home on a<br>sprawling piece of land overlooking the rolling hills of East Jordan, a<br>sleepy little factory town more famous for its manhole covers than for its<br>biker population.<br>     T.A.‘s first leather jacket, given to him by his uncle when he was an<br>infant, hangs just outside his den. While T.A. and Leroy hugged, I had a<br>quick look around the living room. Then, making me feel immediately<br>welcome, T.A. walked over to me and said with a smile, “What‘s up, Rob? I‘m<br>T.A.“<br><br>BENCHING 480 LBs.<br>    He invited us into his den, which is a veritable Outlaws museum. The walls<br>are lined with framed photographs commemorating past biker meetings and<br>club events; shelves are packed with various Outlaws knick-knacks. A police<br>scanner squawked and screeched from one corner, while a phone sat waiting<br>to ring in another. There was a weight bench with 360 pounds up on the<br>rack. T.A. does reps with that. He can bench 480 pounds.<br>     Darting about the room, T.A grabbed pictures off the wall and shuffled<br>through stacks of papers, all the while explaining life as an Outlaw. As<br>president of the Michigan Outlaws, T.A. is in charge of coordinating a<br>network of chapters scattered around the state. This role requires him to<br>be, at once, a politician, an organizer of events, a settler of disputes, a<br>diplomat and, most importantly, a brother to his fellow Outlaws.<br>     The phone rang. It was “Trigger“ calling from prison. T.A. said hello to<br>him, passed the phone to Leroy and then continued narrating the photographs<br>we were looking through. I heard Leroy telling Trigger about the swap meet<br>they were planning in Detroit that coming weekend, then he passed the phone<br>to me.<br><br>SERVING TIME<br>    Trigger has been serving time for the last 26 years for a murder<br>conviction.  It‘s an injustice according to the Outlaws, who have begun a<br>petition campaign to get him released.  Trigger told me about the petition<br>and explained his case. Neither T.A. nor Leroy knew Trigger before he was<br>locked up, but the bond as Outlaws is enough for them to fight for his<br>cause.<br>     Leroy got his first Harley when he was 13. We were on our way to look at<br>three of the seven Harleys he currently owns.<br>      “Our club is about a bunch of guys that wanna be tight and have a brotherhood,“ T.A. said as he navigated his 37-foot mobile home around the curves and hills of East Jordan. Outlaws are quick to point out that theirs is not a “gang,“ it‘s a club. The<br>difference, according to the Outlaws, is that gangs aren‘t as organized.<br>Gangs don‘t donate toys to Toys for Tots or organize scholarship funds in<br>their communities. A gang would not have raised money for the family of<br>Kayla Rolland, the Flint girl who was shot at school by a classmate who<br>brought a gun to class.<br><br>A REPUTATION<br>    Whether warranted or not, however, the Outlaws have gained a reputation for<br>being a motorcycle “gang“ that thrives, at least in part, on violence, drug<br>trafficking, racketeering and a bevy of various other criminal activities.<br>     A past national president was on the FBI‘s ten most wanted list. “Once you<br>put this patch on,“ T.A remarked, as he pointed to the Outlaws logo - a<br>skull and two crossed pistons -- on his vest, “you‘re no longer an<br>individual. If one guy gets in trouble, we‘re all in trouble. It‘s kind of<br>a bummer. [The police] go after the officers in the club. They would come<br>for me, you know? I gotta keep them guys in line, because I don‘t want to<br>go to jail.“<br>     It‘s no secret that bikers are known to have their feuds. The prevailing<br>public opinion is that biker “gangs“ feud among one another, that there are<br>turf wars and enmity. But, say the Outlaws, such behavior is of the past;<br>it‘s the media that have not bothered to understand the situation today.<br>     “It‘s not the sixties anymore. Times change, and you gotta go with the<br>changes,“ said T.A., as we sat around the table in his motor home now<br>parked outside the Alba Outlaws clubhouse, “I‘m not saying that in the past<br>there haven‘t been feuds between the clubs and people got hurt, but those<br>were isolated events. They weren‘t the club as a whole. If somebody gets<br>into a fight with an Outlaw, they started it and they deserve it.“<br><br>SOMETHING SPIRITUAL<br>    Regardless of any illegal activities the Outlaws have been accused of being<br>involved in, the club is ultimately about something higher, something<br>more spiritual. It‘s about riding your bike. It‘s about camaraderie and<br>trust. It‘s about traveling the open road with your brothers. Bikers don‘t<br>join the Outlaws because they want to be criminals. As T.A. explains, “I<br>wanted to join the Outlaws because I saw a bunch of guys hanging out and<br>riding their bikes and having a good time. It‘s about biking and<br>brotherhood.“<br>     Later, inside the Alba clubhouse, “Fuzzy“, an elder member of the Alba<br>chapter of the Outlaws, explained the concept of biking and brotherhood,<br>“You can actually travel for next to nothing. I used to be able to take a<br>quarter and travel from Detroit to Ft. Lauderdale and still have that same<br>quarter in my pocket.“ T.A. quickly interrupted, “That‘s no joke.“<br>     When Outlaws travel the country, they always know that they can find a home<br>in any town that has a chapter. The vast majority of clubhouses are<br>equipped with beds, showers, kitchens and bathrooms, not to mention bars,<br>pool tables and televisions. Fuzzy continued, “Every place that I would go,<br>I would get fed and get a shower; the old ladies would wash our clothes,<br>and, usually, the brothers would pat you on the back, fill up your gas tank<br>and you‘d go on to the next chapter.“<br>    To reinforce the bond between Outlaws, the club goes out of its way to<br>arrange functions where members from around the country and the world can<br>come to meet, hang out and party. “[Chapters] get together every week, we<br>have meetings, we plan runs, we have little parties so we can have a good<br>time in the summer. In the winter we work hard,“ explained T.A.<br><br>MANDATORY RUN<br>    One of the biggest events every year is Bike Week in Daytona, Florida. “We<br>go every year. Daytona is a mandatory run for us,“ T.A. remarked. It takes<br>place in the middle of winter, so for many Outlaws it‘s a welcome escape<br>from the dreariness of winter. It‘s also one of the biggest bike events in<br>the world, so it gives Outlaws a chance to meet their international<br>brothers.<br>     The Alba clubhouse is testimony to the dedication of Outlaws. It‘s housed<br>in an expansive building on the main intersection in Alba, right down the<br>road from city hall, police headquarters and next door to the community<br>center. Aside from the high school, it‘s the biggest building in town.<br>     “We spend a lot of time up here in the summer,“ T.A. said as he pointed to<br>the snow-covered fire pits behind the building. When T.A. bought the<br>building years ago to build the clubhouse, it was in a state of utter<br>disrepair. Over the years, however, club members have put time and effort<br>into making it a place where Outlaws can come from anywhere and feel at<br>home. Now, the Alba clubhouse has all the amenities one could want, and it<br>has become a summer getaway for Outlaw members from all over the state, the<br>country and the world.<br><br>JOINING THE CLUB<br>     But, in order to enjoy the perks of membership, you must first be<br>dedicated. As Leroy explained, “The process of getting into our club is a<br>long, getting-to-know each other process. We don‘t have people doing<br>illegal stuff to get in our club, like it says in the press. They don‘t<br>have to steal a bike or sell drugs.“ <br>    An aspiring Outlaw must first get to know members of the club. Once club members are convinced a candidate will make a good Outlaw, he is made a “probationary“ member. He must wear a patch on his vest that says he‘s a probationary member and perform menial<br>tasks, such as making drinks and taking out the trash, around the clubhouse<br>in order to prove his loyalty and dedication.<br>     “It takes a lot of dedication to be a one-percenter, an Outlaw,“ said Leroy as we<br>stood in “the office“, a large room with couches and a television, in the<br>Alba clubhouse. The probationary period could last as long as a couple<br>years. “We try to distance ourselves from the other 99% of the population<br>by the way we look, the way we dress, the way we roll in a pack. One-percenters do<br>things differently. It‘s a way of life.“ <br><br>RUDE STARES<br>    T.A. was on his phone again. It had been ringing all day. So had his<br>two-way and his pager and the clubhouse phone and his home phone. He spoke<br>loudly into his headset, while his little Nokia phone sat on the table next<br>to his coffee. The waitress -- who greeted him by name when we walked into<br>The Fishing Hole and asked why he hadn‘t been around lately -- walked over<br>to fill up his cup. A middle-aged couple across the room stared rudely at<br>T.A. and Leroy, who paid no attention. Behind the middle-aged couple,<br>parked outside, was T.A.‘s mobile home.<br>    The couple seemed appalled by T.A., by his conspicuous style, by the<br>oversized gold rings that adorned every finger, by the numerous thick and<br>flashy gold chains around his neck and the medallions that hung from them.<br>He was wearing his hat at the table. It was cold outside and he wore a<br>sleeveless shirt. His large tattooed arms were intimidating. The couple<br>whispered to one another when T.A. was at the salad bar. They stared at the<br>skull and crossed pistons and the word “Outlaws“ on the back of his vest<br>while he made a salad, still talking on his phone.<br>    T.A. got the steak, well done, and potatoes. Leroy got the blackened<br>catfish and a glass of milk. The cell phone rang again, “I‘m eating dinner<br>and just finishing up with the reporter, so I‘ll be home soon.“ He hung up,<br>pulled the earpiece out of his ear and said to me, “The wife.“<br>     As we were leaving the restaurant, our waitress told T.A. to hold on. She<br>wanted him to see her husband‘s new tattoo. She disappeared into the<br>kitchen and reappeared shortly with her husband in tow. He rolled up his<br>sleeve to reveal the fresh ink. T.A. leaned in and said, “Nice, man.“ The<br>tattoo artist who had done the work happened to be eating across the room.<br>T.A. turned to him and said loudly, “You‘re going to have do some work for<br>me.“ The middle-aged couple, now scoffing, stared on in amazement.<br>     We walked past them and out of the restaurant. T.A never once looked at<br>them. T.A. is an Outlaw, a 1%er, and he doesn‘t give a shit.<br><br>     Rob Young is a special features writer for Review Magazine, the alternative newspaper serving the tri-cities area of Saginaw, Bay City and Midland.<br>
