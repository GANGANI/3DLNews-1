Education Reporter for MLive/The Ann Arbor News, covering University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University and other local liberal arts colleges. Through his coverage of University of Michigan, he balances serious reporting such as the Dr. Robert Anderson sexual abuse scandal and President Mark Schlissel's firing with highlighting impressive faculty, students and staff. As an investigative reporter, he uncovered a toxic climate in the Michigan hockey program, inequitable vaccine distribution at Ford Field and multiple examples of misconduct among faculty and multiple athletes. His work has been nominated for multiple Michigan Associated Press awards, most recently a feature on Michigan Center High School football's emotional run in the state playoffs after teammates died the previous summer. He also writes a biweekly food column Dish of the Week, highlighting the best food in Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County. Formerly a U.S. Navy officer until 2017, he worked as a sports reporter covering the 2018 Olympics, as well as high school sports in Orange County for the Los Angeles Times. He graduated from University of Michigan in 2013, then after his military career, he earned his master's in journalism at University of Southern California in 2018.","fuzzy_match":false,"firstName":"Samuel","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"location":"Ann Arbor, MI","_id":"sdodge","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"","slug":""}]},"subtype":"article","first_publish_date":"2024-05-30T22:27:45.578Z","additional_properties":{"is_published":true,"clipboard":{},"publish_date":"2024-05-30T23:17:24.884Z","has_published_copy":true},"last_updated_date":"2024-05-30T23:52:49.148Z","publishing":{"scheduled_operations":{"unpublish_edition":[],"publish_edition":[]}},"owner":{"sponsored":false,"id":"advancelocal"},"address":{},"workflow":{"status_code":1},"label":{},"promo_items":{"basic":{"owner":{"sponsored":false,"id":"advancelocal"},"copyright":"Curtis Means @ 2024","address":{"locality":"New York","country_name":"USA","region":"NY"},"syndication":{},"auth":{"1":"da61f76a933a533e25fd75e378463e1626c67934028ececc0f2a9fb35b05ffeb"},"caption":"FILE - Former President Donald Trump appears at Manhattan criminal court, April 16, 2024, in New York.

He writes about a variety of topics, but mostly national sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten, and crime and courts in Metro Detroit, Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Other areas of interest include Michigan history, food, beer and restaurants, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Transportation. Brandon also hosts MLive's Spartan Confidential podcast, which focuses on all-things Michigan State including football, basketball and recruiting, and the Second Day Film Podcast, a show about movies and TV. Brandon has spent more than a decade in journalism since graduating from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before joining MLive, he was an intern at his hometown newspaper, the Cadillac News, and was a sports reporter at CM-Life. When he's not working, he's probably playing golf, arguing about fantasy sports or at the movie theater.

He writes about a variety of topics, but mostly national sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten, and crime and courts in Metro Detroit, Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Other areas of interest include Michigan history, food, beer and restaurants, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Transportation. Brandon also hosts MLive's Spartan Confidential podcast, which focuses on all-things Michigan State including football, basketball and recruiting, and the Second Day Film Podcast, a show about movies and TV. Brandon has spent more than a decade in journalism since graduating from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before joining MLive, he was an intern at his hometown newspaper, the Cadillac News, and was a sports reporter at CM-Life. When he's not working, he's probably playing golf, arguing about fantasy sports or at the movie theater.

He writes about a variety of topics, but mostly national sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten, and crime and courts in Metro Detroit, Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Other areas of interest include Michigan history, food, beer and restaurants, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Transportation. Brandon also hosts MLive's Spartan Confidential podcast, which focuses on all-things Michigan State including football, basketball and recruiting, and the Second Day Film Podcast, a show about movies and TV. Brandon has spent more than a decade in journalism since graduating from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before joining MLive, he was an intern at his hometown newspaper, the Cadillac News, and was a sports reporter at CM-Life. When he's not working, he's probably playing golf, arguing about fantasy sports or at the movie theater.

He writes about a variety of topics, but mostly national sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten, and crime and courts in Metro Detroit, Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Other areas of interest include Michigan history, food, beer and restaurants, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Transportation. Brandon also hosts MLive's Spartan Confidential podcast, which focuses on all-things Michigan State including football, basketball and recruiting, and the Second Day Film Podcast, a show about movies and TV. Brandon has spent more than a decade in journalism since graduating from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before joining MLive, he was an intern at his hometown newspaper, the Cadillac News, and was a sports reporter at CM-Life. When he's not working, he's probably playing golf, arguing about fantasy sports or at the movie theater.

He writes about a variety of topics, but mostly national sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten, and crime and courts in Metro Detroit, Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Other areas of interest include Michigan history, food, beer and restaurants, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Transportation. Brandon also hosts MLive's Spartan Confidential podcast, which focuses on all-things Michigan State including football, basketball and recruiting, and the Second Day Film Podcast, a show about movies and TV. Brandon has spent more than a decade in journalism since graduating from Central Michigan University in 2013. Before joining MLive, he was an intern at his hometown newspaper, the Cadillac News, and was a sports reporter at CM-Life. When he's not working, he's probably playing golf, arguing about fantasy sports or at the movie theater.
