Cassy&rsquo;s parents, Mark and Sandra Hall, say the doctors aren&rsquo;t sure what happened. An autopsy is being performed, and the results are expected back in four to six weeks.<br />Hall&rsquo;s death has affected both the Homer community, where she grew up, and the Litchfield community, where her family lived and where she attended school this year.<br />Hall attended Homer Community Schools until the 2006-07 school year when her family moved to Litchfield. She began her sophomore year at Litchfield High School.<br />Holly Blashfield, Hall&rsquo;s eighth and ninth grade social studies teacher at Homer, remembers Hall as a hard-working student with a lot of potential.<br />&ldquo;She was a sweetheart,&rdquo; Blashfield said. &ldquo;She was a hard worker. She was always personable and well-liked by her peers.&rdquo;<br />Aaron Bulgrien, Hall&rsquo;s English teacher at Litchfield High School, also remembers Hall as a sweetheart who put forward her best effort in class.<br />&ldquo;Cassy was well above average,&rdquo; Bulgrien noted. &ldquo;She loved to volunteer to read, and she always wanted the biggest parts in the plays we read.<br />&ldquo;I was amazed that in her first year here she had a large group of friends, and fit in with any group. She could make friends with anyone.&rdquo;<br />Cassie Sharlow, a junior at Litchfield High School, was one of Hall&rsquo;s new friends.<br />&ldquo;This was the first year I&#8200;knew Cassie. She was always smiling, always having fun,&rdquo; Sharlow said. &ldquo;We have probably 400 kids in school, and she shined out of them all. Now the hall seems dead without her.&rdquo;<br />Hall was an outgoing, compassionate teen who is deeply missed by both her Homer and Litchfield friends.<br />&ldquo;Monday, after I heard the news, I got flashbacks of all the things Cassy and I did, and I realized I can&rsquo;t get any more memories with her,&rdquo; 15-year-old Stacy West, of Homer, said.<br />Hall regularly visited her Homer friends - West, Ariel Jeffries, Katherine O&rsquo;Dell, Robin Diane Bailey and Jessica Bailey. The group was closely knit, doing everything together.<br />One of the group&rsquo;s favorite activities was PS Food Mart runs.<br />&ldquo;Cassy loved PS. She&nbsp; loved Subway and Mountain Dew, and she always wanted to try the new sub at Subway,&rdquo; West said.<br />According to her Homer friends</span>,<span style="font-weight:normal"> Hall was a fiercely loyal friend, sticking up for them when they were in trouble, and crying with them when they were sad.<br />Bailey remembers when her dog died, Hall sat with her and cried along with her. West remembers turning to Hall when her boyfriend broke up with her.<br />&ldquo;I was in civics class and sat there and cried. Cassy looked at me and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right dude, he&rsquo;s a loser and you&rsquo;re better than that,&rsquo;&rdquo; West said.<br />O&rsquo;Dell, a relative of Hall&rsquo;s, fondly remembers Hall&rsquo;s love for O&rsquo;Dell&rsquo;s two-year-old son, Matthew. Hall always wanted to spend time with him and got him a bear, which the family treasures.<br />&ldquo;Her laughter was contagious. Even if you were in a bad mood you couldn&rsquo;t help but break out laughing with her,&rdquo; the group noted.<br />Hall was an encourager to her friends, who sometimes felt insecure. They all remember her as being a confident, bubbly girl who tried to uplift her friends and make them feel special.<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always have high self-esteem, and Cassy would tell me I&#8200;looked fine and was gorgeous, and I had no reason not to have high self-esteem,&rdquo; Jeffries said.<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard not being able to say good-bye to her,&rdquo; West said.<br />&ldquo;She loved life so much. Every single day she wanted to live life to the fullest,&rdquo; Bailey noted.<br />The Hall family has been amazed at the outpouring of support from Hall&rsquo;s friends and the community.<br />Hall&rsquo;s funeral at Riverside Baptist Church in Homer was packed, with standing room only. The Halls note that some people were turned away because it was so crowded.<br />The family plans to hold another memorial service for Hall&rsquo;s friends later in the month.<br />&ldquo;I&#8200;knew my daughter was well-liked, but I&#8200;had no idea how much,&rdquo; Mark Hall said. &ldquo;The family from out-of-state who came for the funeral were impressed with Cassy&rsquo;s friends, and all the love I saw is what got me through.&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;There are no words to describe it. I was amazed and I&rsquo;m still amazed. I&rsquo;m just beginning to understand what Cassy meant to the world.&rdquo; (w/photo)</span><br /><br /><strong>Robert E.
