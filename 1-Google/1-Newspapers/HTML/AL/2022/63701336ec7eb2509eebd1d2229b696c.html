She has won numerous state and regional awards for her crime reporting and feature writing, including  the 2020 Sigma Delta Chi Awards for excellence in journalism for stories she wrote about the 2020 shooting death of 8-year-old Royta Giles at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, and a Green Eyeshade Award for her coverage of the abduction of Kamille “Cupcake” McKinney, a 3-year-old Birmingham girl who was found murdered 10 days after she disappeared from a birthday party, and Alabama Press Association Story of the Year for the story on three people killed in 2014 -- including the gunman -- after a shooting at a UPS facility in Birmingham.\nShe is a graduate of Vestavia Hills High School and Auburn University.

She began her journalism career at The Birmingham News in 1986, and has covered numerous beats including county government, business, education and general assignment reporting. In 1996, she became the lead crime reporter, focusing not only on the initial crimes, but also giving a voice to victims and their families in the aftermath of those crimes. She has won numerous state and regional awards for her crime reporting and feature writing, including  the 2020 Sigma Delta Chi Awards for excellence in journalism for stories she wrote about the 2020 shooting death of 8-year-old Royta Giles at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, and a Green Eyeshade Award for her coverage of the abduction of Kamille “Cupcake” McKinney, a 3-year-old Birmingham girl who was found murdered 10 days after she disappeared from a birthday party, and Alabama Press Association Story of the Year for the story on three people killed in 2014 -- including the gunman -- after a shooting at a UPS facility in Birmingham.\nShe is a graduate of Vestavia Hills High School and Auburn University.

She has won numerous state and regional awards for her crime reporting and feature writing, including  the 2020 Sigma Delta Chi Awards for excellence in journalism for stories she wrote about the 2020 shooting death of 8-year-old Royta Giles at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, and a Green Eyeshade Award for her coverage of the abduction of Kamille “Cupcake” McKinney, a 3-year-old Birmingham girl who was found murdered 10 days after she disappeared from a birthday party, and Alabama Press Association Story of the Year for the story on three people killed in 2014 -- including the gunman -- after a shooting at a UPS facility in Birmingham.\nShe is a graduate of Vestavia Hills High School and Auburn University.
