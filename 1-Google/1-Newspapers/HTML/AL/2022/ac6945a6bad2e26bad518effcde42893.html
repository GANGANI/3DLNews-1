That story won the George Polk Award for local reporting, the Sidney Hillman Award for web journalism, and a Best-in-Show National Headliner Award, among others. He was a 2021 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 2023 was named inaugural Writer in Residence at Boston University. Archibald wrote and hosted the national Murrow Award-winning podcast \"Unjustifiable\" in 2021, and is enshrined on the student journalism hall of fame by the University of Alabama, his alma mater. The 2018 Pulitzer Prize jury described his columns as \"lyrical and courageous commentary that is rooted in Alabama but has a national resonance in scrutinizing corrupt politicians, championing the rights of women and calling out hypocrisy.\" His book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, was named one of NPR's \"books we love\" of 2021.\n","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-archibald-3815397/","location":"Birmingham, Ala.","personal_website":"https://www.johnarchibaldink.com/"}}}]},"height":3024,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2022-04-25T14:04:36Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"advancelocal","sponsored":false},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Brookside Mayor Mike Bryan","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/3YEKUMOYE5CJ3AGR4C4WAO253U.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":4032,"syndication":{},"auth":{"1":"a4002d0a6f47eeab0e1039dadff27d3611833b2bfde09f6ef114d9396707c344"},"resized_urls":{"large":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/3YEKUMOYE5CJ3AGR4C4WAO253U.jpg?auth=a4002d0a6f47eeab0e1039dadff27d3611833b2bfde09f6ef114d9396707c344&width=1280&quality=90","medium":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/3YEKUMOYE5CJ3AGR4C4WAO253U.jpg?auth=a4002d0a6f47eeab0e1039dadff27d3611833b2bfde09f6ef114d9396707c344&width=800&quality=90","small":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/3YEKUMOYE5CJ3AGR4C4WAO253U.jpg?auth=a4002d0a6f47eeab0e1039dadff27d3611833b2bfde09f6ef114d9396707c344&width=500&quality=90","x_small":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/3YEKUMOYE5CJ3AGR4C4WAO253U.jpg?auth=a4002d0a6f47eeab0e1039dadff27d3611833b2bfde09f6ef114d9396707c344&width=180&quality=90"}},{"_id":"AMFYGXTPQNA3BB2NHZ7L5AJYYM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1650900011505,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"The town began to tow huge numbers of cars, and reap huge rewards.

That story won the George Polk Award for local reporting, the Sidney Hillman Award for web journalism, and a Best-in-Show National Headliner Award, among others. He was a 2021 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 2023 was named inaugural Writer in Residence at Boston University. Archibald wrote and hosted the national Murrow Award-winning podcast \"Unjustifiable\" in 2021, and is enshrined on the student journalism hall of fame by the University of Alabama, his alma mater. The 2018 Pulitzer Prize jury described his columns as \"lyrical and courageous commentary that is rooted in Alabama but has a national resonance in scrutinizing corrupt politicians, championing the rights of women and calling out hypocrisy.\" His book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, was named one of NPR's \"books we love\" of 2021.\n","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-archibald-3815397/","location":"Birmingham, Ala.","personal_website":"https://www.johnarchibaldink.com/"}}}]},"height":966,"image_type":"photograph","last_updated_date":"2022-04-25T14:16:14Z","licensable":false,"owner":{"id":"advancelocal","sponsored":false},"source":{"additional_properties":{"editor":"photo center"},"edit_url":"","system":"photo center"},"subtitle":"Chief Henry Irby","taxonomy":{"associated_tasks":[]},"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/SJVMJJ3W6VE3TIBYLNZIQAYQYM.jpg","version":"0.10.9","width":905,"syndication":{},"auth":{"1":"86cf74ec196c166ab62ef6d01a6e6f97d6eed59ad49ff15f340917da5fc1e2bb"},"resized_urls":{"large":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/SJVMJJ3W6VE3TIBYLNZIQAYQYM.jpg?auth=86cf74ec196c166ab62ef6d01a6e6f97d6eed59ad49ff15f340917da5fc1e2bb&width=1280&quality=90","medium":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/SJVMJJ3W6VE3TIBYLNZIQAYQYM.jpg?auth=86cf74ec196c166ab62ef6d01a6e6f97d6eed59ad49ff15f340917da5fc1e2bb&width=800&quality=90","small":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/SJVMJJ3W6VE3TIBYLNZIQAYQYM.jpg?auth=86cf74ec196c166ab62ef6d01a6e6f97d6eed59ad49ff15f340917da5fc1e2bb&width=500&quality=90","x_small":"https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/SJVMJJ3W6VE3TIBYLNZIQAYQYM.jpg?auth=86cf74ec196c166ab62ef6d01a6e6f97d6eed59ad49ff15f340917da5fc1e2bb&width=180&quality=90"}},{"_id":"ZJSWUMUZMJDDFF2FMEI5BKNYYA","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1650900011566,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"At a March 7 town council meeting Mayor Bryan stood in the spot where Wooten sat on court days, in the reflection of the Ten Commandments.

That story won the George Polk Award for local reporting, the Sidney Hillman Award for web journalism, and a Best-in-Show National Headliner Award, among others. He was a 2021 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 2023 was named inaugural Writer in Residence at Boston University. Archibald wrote and hosted the national Murrow Award-winning podcast \"Unjustifiable\" in 2021, and is enshrined on the student journalism hall of fame by the University of Alabama, his alma mater. The 2018 Pulitzer Prize jury described his columns as \"lyrical and courageous commentary that is rooted in Alabama but has a national resonance in scrutinizing corrupt politicians, championing the rights of women and calling out hypocrisy.\" His book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, was named one of NPR's \"books we love\" of 2021.\n","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-archibald-3815397/","location":"Birmingham, Ala.","personal_website":"https://www.johnarchibaldink.com/"}}}]},"subtype":"article","first_publish_date":"2022-04-26T12:02:00.498Z","websites":{"al":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news","_website":"al","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"News","description":"Get Alabama latest news.

That story won the George Polk Award for local reporting, the Sidney Hillman Award for web journalism, and a Best-in-Show National Headliner Award, among others. He was a 2021 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and in 2023 was named inaugural Writer in Residence at Boston University. Archibald wrote and hosted the national Murrow Award-winning podcast \"Unjustifiable\" in 2021, and is enshrined on the student journalism hall of fame by the University of Alabama, his alma mater. The 2018 Pulitzer Prize jury described his columns as \"lyrical and courageous commentary that is rooted in Alabama but has a national resonance in scrutinizing corrupt politicians, championing the rights of women and calling out hypocrisy.\" His book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, was named one of NPR's \"books we love\" of 2021.\n","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-archibald-3815397/","location":"Birmingham, Ala.","personal_website":"https://www.johnarchibaldink.com/"}}}]},"subtype":"article","first_publish_date":"2022-04-26T12:02:00.498Z","websites":{"al":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news","_website":"al","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"News","description":"Get Alabama latest news.
