<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UWA Sports Shorts</h2>



<p>Washington&#8217;s Interceptions Land Him GSC Defensive Player of the Week Honors<br>The Gulf South Conference (GSC) announced on Monday that senior defensive back Artavious Washington was chosen as the league&#8217;s Defensive Player of the Week after his performance against No. 5/6 Angelo State last Thursday night. The Lexington, Miss. native had two interceptions against one of the best defenses in the country a year ago and added three tackles and a pass breakup. His first career interception in a Tiger uniform was a big one for both ends of the ball. On a third down play in the first period, Washington picked off Gerald Gardner&#8217;s pass and returned it 38 yards to the ASU 27-yard-line. On the next play from scrimmage, Spencer Arceneaux scored on a 27-yard rush to even the game at seven. Late in the first half, with the Rams driving inside the red zone, Gardner found Washington again in the end zone for his second INT of the game that ended a six-play, 49-yard drive. Washington and the rest of the Tigers return to action on Saturday at Limestone (S. C.) for a 11 a.m. CT kickoff.<br><em>Women&#8217;s Soccer Falls in Home Opener to Clayton State</em><br>Women&#8217;s Soccer accrued its first loss of the season Sept. 3 in their home opener against Clayton State, losing 1-0 in an offensive struggle.<br><em>Volleyball Concludes Competition in Texas</em><br>The University of West Alabama volleyball team wrapped up play at the Midwestern State Invitational on Saturday, falling to Western Colorado and Eastern New Mexico from D.L. Ligon Coliseum.<br><em>Men&#8217;s Soccer Cruises to 6-1 Victory in Home Opener</em><br>West Alabama won in dominant fashion in their home opener on Saturday at Tiger Stadium by a 6-1 Advantage, Tied for 3rd Most in program history. It was a nearly perfect performance from &#8220;the lads,&#8221; as the scoring frenzy from the Tigers began early in the 3rd minute of the first half, courtesy of Ellis Williamson. The Tigers continued to spread the love offensively early in the first half, as Baronyi Kengeye scored during the 14th minute. Unfortunately for the Nighthawks, the onslaught didn&#8217;t stop there. In the 30th minute, Adrian Evrard scored yet another goal for the Tigers Club. West Alabama showed impressive defensive prowess in the first half, allowing zero goals and only three shots at the net. The Tigers continued to move the ball around generously, with Yannick Pohland scoring the 4th Tiger goal in the 55th minute, assisted by the previously mentioned Evrard. Evrard scored his second goal of the game off a penalty kick in the 62nd minute, putting the Tigers in a commanding 5-0 lead. North Georgia wouldn&#8217;t go down without a fight, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of play, courtesy of Daniel Romero. However, the Tigers put one last nail in the coffin quickly, as Jahir Hernandez Scored the 6th goal of the night in the 89th minute. West Alabama improves to 1-1 on the year, while North Georgia drops to 0-2. The Tigers will wrap up a two game homestand on Friday against Eckerd in Tiger Stadium. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.<br><em>Women’s Soccer Rallies from Slow Start to Draw with Pioneers</em><br>After going down 2-0 at the half, the University of West Alabama women&#8217;s soccer team bounced back with two second half goals to earn a 2-2 tie with Tusculum University (Tenn.), Friday from Pioneer Field. Each team starts the year with an identical record of 0-0-1. Additionally, this is the second year of an NCAA rule change where a regular season match is tied at the end of regulation, there is no overtime and the game ends. Extra time will return to play in the postseason, starting with the conference tournament. The Pioneers struck first off a corner kick by Marja Enste in the 25th minute. The pass found Sydney Grant, and she tapped the ball into the net for the early 1-0 advantage. Nearly four minutes later, Grant made it a 2-0 advantage off a double assist by Joey Garrett and Wilma Axelsson. That would be the last shot Tusculum would make until the 63rd minute, and that was plenty of time for West Alabama to get back into the contest. Close to four minutes into the start of the second half, a costly mistake for the home team was pounced on quickly by the visitors. Looking to reset the offense, Venla Makela put pressure on the defense to make a clean pass, but she intercepted the ball and scored UWA&#8217;s first goal of the year on an empty net. Later in the 55th minute, Makela found Aileen Charles&#8217;s pass from the right side to even the match at two goals apiece. After allowing Tusculum six first half shots, the West Alabama defense tightened up by allowing two shots in the final 45 minutes, with one saved by Dior Wilson in the 65th minute. In the second stanza, the offense stepped up for UWA, taking nine shots. The Tigers had two chances to break the tie in the 76th and 86th minutes, but the strikes were both saved. Scoring just two goals during her 2022 campaign, sophomore Venla Makela matched that in the season opener on Friday, taking four total shots. Aileen Charles, who assisted on the second goal for UWA, also had three shots on the afternoon. Dior Wilson (0-0-1) made just two saves in full time, but she and the defense allowed two shots in the final 60-plus minutes. Sydney Grant scored both goals for the Pioneers on three shots, while Grayson Patterson stopped five shots in goal.

Ward, Jr. SCRJ Associate Editor</em><br>Sumter Central High School&#8217;s annual Homecoming Basketball ended with all three teams winning and a capacity crowd of visitors at the home game held Fri., Nov. 25.<br>“I really appreciate everyone who came out to support the team, and we had more to show up at the game than I&#8217;ve ever seen,” stated Head Coach Jazmin Mitchell, who was a State Champion basketball player himself in 1988.<br>Coach Mitchell said he thought it would be a great idea to invite former players from Sumter High School, Livingston High School and SCHS to come out and show support to the ball players, so he decided call it a “Basketball Homecoming,” and he was so happy that so many chose to come out and support the event after it began in 2021.<br>“I&#8217;m certain we had way over 3,000 people to come out and enjoy the event. There were so many former basketball players and supporters to come out and fellowship, especially after the rain stopped.<br>We were not able to admit everyone to the game. We sold out of seats and standing room for the game,” Mitchell said.<br>“Everyone was so nice. Many of the groups came together with matching shirts. Team members from as far back as 1994, 2001, and others were there representing. I wish I could have photographed them all.<br>“And the teams played well. All three teams won, and the varsity boys defeated Greene County High School 58 to 44,” Coach Mitchell said.<br>Mitchell also thanked all who were willing to support with organizing the event and parking, including Larkin Restaurant owner and former Sumter County School Board member and chairman Wendell Larkin. Larkin smiled and said parking at the event was a challenge, but after the raining stopped, he and his brother were able to direct parking to the practice football field and only had to use a local wrecker service to help a half dozen vehicles.<br>Larkin was a former Sumter High School basketball player himself in the 1970’s, and said efforts have been made to support Sumter school teams in other ways.<br>“What a night! We had a lot of people coming together and everything was so peaceful,” Larkin said. “Its a blessing. We can all continue to come together for the children of Sumter County and continue to help them,” Larkin added.<br>“I really want to thank everyone for supporting our teams during this second Homecoming event. We appreciate all for their support, and we look forward to coming together again next year,” Coach Mitchell said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Greensboro Raiders beat Sumter Central Jaguars 41-18 on “Military Appreciation” night</h2>



<p><em>By Travis Vaughn, Editor</em><br>The Greensboro Raiders defeated the visiting Sumter Central Jaguars 41-18 Thursday night, September 1, at Robert Lucky Field in Greensboro.<br>The Raiders declared the night to be their “Military Appreciation Game” and dedicated the game to William Thomas, an Air Force veteran, law enforcement retiree, and community supporter who died earlier this year.<br>The excitement of the pre-game commemorations, including the game ball being presented by the AirEvac air ambulance crew based in Demopolis, seemed to carry over to the game for the Raiders.<br>The Raiders scored their first touchdown with 8:48 left in the first quarter. The Jags threw an interception, with the return taking it down to the 22 yard line. A penalty flag thrown against Sumter for ripping the helmet off a Greensboro player made it first down at the 11. A touchdown run followed, making it 13-0 with 7:38 left in the first quarter.<br>The Jaguars got the ball near midfield after a short kickoff. Sumter capitalized on the short field with a touchdown pass, making it 13-8 with a successful two-point play at the 3:43 mark.<br>In the second quarter, the Raiders added a touchdown plus two-point play early in the quarter, making it 21-8. Greensboro then took advantage of a Sumter fumble as Ty&#8217;darrion Lewis snagged a touchdown pass. The two-pointer was also good, making it 29-8 with 4:57 left in the half.<br>On the next Sumter drive, the Jags couldn’t convert on fourth down, so the ball went over to Greensboro on downs. A backwards pass by the Raiders was recovered by the Jags, but they turned the ball right back over to Greensboro with an interception. Greensboro would then score a touchdown on a pass from Ryian Hamilton to Lewis with 1:11 left in the half. The two-point conversion was no good, so the score stood at 35-8.<br>The onside kick attempt by Greensboro was recovered by the Jags, who moved the ball down to the Greensboro 6. Sumter scored on third and goal from the 2 as time expired, and the two-point play was good, putting the score at 35-16 at the half.<br>Not much scoring took place in the second half, as Greensboro held on to the big lead and won 41-18.<br>Greensboro is now 1-2 on the season, while Sumter Central is also now 1-2. Greensboro next hosts St. James, while the Jags will travel to face the Southside (Selma) Panthers this Friday night.</p>

<p><br><strong>UCS Falls in Season Opener to Hubbertville 18-8</strong><br><em>Written by Coach Sam Mosley</em><br>UCS hosted its first ever game under the Friday night lights on August 19th. UCS hosted Hubbertville from Fayette County, Ala. The game was hard fought but mistakes by the Blazers in critical moments of the game were the deciding factor.<br>The game started off strong for the Blazers, after the opening kickoff UCS held Hub to a 3 and out, forced a punt and then took the ball on an 18 play 95 yard drive that ended in a touchdown and took 9 minutes off the clock. The 2 point try was successful. There was some back and forth but later in the second quarter mistakes and penalties on crucial downs aided the Lions on their first Touchdown of the night. UCS had 2 other opportunities later in the game inside the 10 and did not come away with points.<br>“I was pleased with the way our kids competed, I don&#8217;t think anyone on either side could say any of our kids quit or rolled over and I am proud of that. We just made too many mistakes in crucial times and that got us in the end. Focus needs to improve for this group, we have all the physical tools to get the job done but need to sharpen up on the mental part of the game as well as the situational part of the game.”<br>Stats<br>Top Players<br>Touchdowns<br>Craig Ellington 9 Yd Pass from Braden Murray (Two-Point Conversion) 8 points<br>Top Players<br>2.

<p>Jasmin Mitchell Basketball Camp in Livingston. The camp was held on Saturday, July 30 at Sumter Central High School gymnasium. The &#8216;Jaz Camp’ is a free basketball camp that is for ages 5-18. Coach Jasmin Mitchell said he was excited for this year’s camp to get kids out of the house and back on the court to work on different skills and drills. Coach Mitchell really emphasized how important it is to him to make sure the camp is free, so that anyone can attend. Mitchell said, “My goal is to get our kids in Sumter County a chance to have a free basketball camp because basketball is so high and with the COVID going on, things [cost] are so high for our kids so I want to give our kids an opportunity to have a chance like the other kids. A free basketball camp in Sumter County.”</p>



<p>Mitchell who is a York Councilman and SCHS Basketball Coach held the first annual camp last year where over 126 children took advantage of the free camp.</p>

<p><em>By Kasey DeCastra,<br>SCRJ Community News Editor, scores &amp; quotes care of AHSAA, photos care of @universitycharterschool</em><br>UCS Trailblazers varsity girls basketbal team won, 45-44, last Wednesday night over Linden. Marion County defeated UCS, 71-39, Monday, Feb. 28.<br>“I am extremely proud of our team. This is only the fourth year of even being a school. We have to be better about taking care of the ball when we have it. We made a lot of progress and I&#8217;m extremely proud of us getting here. We&#8217;re gonna get back in the gym and work to be back next year. It made a big impact on the game because the other team has been here before. We let the nerves get to us early and by the time we settled down it was hard to climb out of the hole we were in. My first thing I told them was to keep their heads up. I didn’t harp on what we did, I talked about what we didn’t do. But we will be back here. We will continue to get better. We kept turning the ball over and we didnt take care of it like we should. They came out and played the defense we talked about all week. For us to be successful we have to take care of the ball. We will be back here. We are totally confident. We will tackle the attention next year straight on. We know now that we can do it and other teams will know it too. There’s no more sneaking up on people. We preach about how to fight through adversity,” state Coach Lewis.<br>Anna Pezent led University Charter (15-9) with 14 points, and Kendall Lacoste had 13 points. Javionna Harrison added nine points and 14 rebounds. The Trailblazers of Coach Kerry Lewis made history by becoming the first charter school in state history to reach the state tournament.<br>“Our area was really tough. I’m proud of us for coming this far. It would have been great to win, but we’ll be back next year. I think we have to stay focused,” Trailblazer #5 Anna Pezent.<br>“It’s really big that we’re here. We have to zone in next time and take all the distraction out,” said UCS’s #14 Kendall Lacoste. “It was a blessing to make it this far, it was a blessing, but we will be back,” said Trailblazer’s #30 Javion Harrison who was upbeat about the next season. “We just have to go out and do it next time.”<br>Marion’s Coach Veal had nice things to say about UCS’s team, as well, “ They played very hard. They never quit. They’re going to be a great team one day. I loved their speed and enthusiasm. We didn’t play great at first, but we picked it up in the second half. We’ve changed everything up from five years ago when we were in the championship game. We got so excited and we missed several easy layups due to nerves, but that’s the way we play. You have to take the chance though. This is what we do. The team we are going to play Thursday is going to be tough. We’ve got a lot of work to do before then. There’s a big difference between this year’s team and last year’s team. It’s maturity, but we’ve changed the mindset. They now know what it takes. They’ve worked really hard, for the most part they’ve mentally and physically done what I’ve asked. They now know the crowd levels, what it’s like to play in Birmingham and at Wallace. We are gonna play Marion County Red Raider basketball. Take the good with the bad and take the chance. It&#8217;s a tempo, we&#8217;ve done it all year. We try to speed the game up and that’s how we play. When I first got to MC, they had never won a game at Wallace State. We changed some things around from what they were doing and it wasn&#8217;t easy. I hope it pays off Thursday.”<br>Marion will play Skyline March 3rd in the state final.</p>

<p>MONTGOMERY – The Alabama High School Athletic Association Central Board of Control unanimously approved Tuesday, December 14 the current seven-classification system for championship play for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years.<br>The seven-class system, which began in 2014-15, was approved once again for all sports.<br>In accordance with the AHSAA constitution and by-laws, the AHSAA Central Board of Control manages championship play and classification. Member schools are reclassified every two years. The high schools are currently divided into seven classifications (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A and 7A) for competition in championship programs.<br>Classification is based on Average Daily Membership (ADM) figures furnished by the State Department of Education for public schools for grades 9 through 11 plus eighth-grade hold-back students. Member private schools report that same data directly to the AHSAA. An index of 1.35 is used to determine the enrollment figure for classifying private school members. Each private school student counts 1.35 for classification purposes.<br>A competitive balance success factor is also applied to private school sports teams which affects approximately 10% of private school teams.<br>Alignments were also released for fall sports, which recently completed championship play for the 2021-22 school year, based on the number of schools declaring to participate in a sport for the upcoming 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years. Some programs may include two or more classes in a division. The alignments for each sport in a class are published in the online AHSAA Sports Book each year.<br>Reclassification, according to the AHSAA Constitution and By-Laws, is conducted every two years by the AHSAA Central Board of Control.<br>“More than 190,000 student-athletes are expected to participate in AHSAA sports activities during the upcoming classification period,” Central Board President Van Phillips, principal at Center Point High School, said.<br>The 2022-23 and 2023-24 football alignment places the 32 largest high schools in Class 7A and 57 in Class 6A, 56 in Class 5A, 62 in Class 4A, 60 in Class 3A, 60 in Class 2A, and 62 in Class 1A.<br>“I want to thank the Classification Task Force, Central Board and AHSAA staff for their dedicated effort and time put in and the recommendations they made,” AHSAA Executive Director Alvin Briggs said. “As always, it was a difficult job, but everyone worked together to find the best solution as we move forward.”<br>Phillips said he also wanted to thank the Classification Task Force and member schools for their input and patience throughout the reclassification process. “These recommendations came after many hours of study and discussion. Everyone involved gave of their valuable time to evaluate our classification system thoroughly and provided valuable input in ways to improve that system,” he said. “On behalf of the Central Board of Control and our member schools, I want to thank Mr. Briggs and his staff for their hard work. I also want to thank our Central Board for their commitment and dedication to providing a first-class athletic program to all our student-athletes, and for making decisions that are best for all of our member schools.”<br>The reclassification alignment data for each sport and the private school competitive balance chart can be found at the following link located at www.ahsaa.com.

UCS total offense was 60 Plays on 406 total yards with 369 yards rushing and four rushing touchdowns with 37 yards passing.<br>“Offensively we had a great overall effort from our guys. They are starting to understand the importance of all eleven players doing their specific jobs every single play. We told the players that the team who is the most physical and made the least mistakes would come out on top, and we were able to do so,” said Coach Mosley.<br>Holy Spirt offensive stats for the game were 28 Plays, 233 total yards with 158 rushing on one touchdown and seventy five Passing on the other touch down.

We gave up some big plays that were on some busted assignments,” said Coach Mosley. “But we weathered the storm and were able to answer their big plays with long sustained drives that kept the ball away from their offense.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="wedgworth-named-world-champion-at-rodeo-finals-in-oklahoma">Wedgworth named World Champion at rodeo finals in Oklahoma</h2>



<p><em>Local cowboy earns multiple top titles at nine years old</em><br>Just two years after entering his first sanctioned rodeo, local cowboy Louis Wedgworth of Livingston has clinched the title of World Champion. This comes just after celebrating multiple state titles won at the Alabama Little Britches Rodeo Association state finals in May.<br>Wedgworth, nine years old, now holds titles as 2021 National Little Britches Rodeo Association (NLBRA) Little Wrangler (LW) All Around World Champion, 2021 NLBRA LW Flag Racing World Champion, and 2021 NLBRA LW Finals Champion. Competition wrapped Sunday, July, 11, at the NLBRA Finals Rodeo in Guthrie, Oklahoma. Prizes associated with his victories include cash earnings, scholarships, saddles, buckles and other tack.<br>Wedgworth competes with two horses. Fastback, his bay gelding, competes in flag racing, and Cowboy, his bay pony, competes in pole bending, barrel racing, and goat tail untying. These equine athletes are champions that work hard for Wedgworth every day.<br>Wedgworth also borrows a grey gelding named Jake from his cowboy friend, Slick Robison, to improve his discipline in the practice pen. Jake has been instrumental in helping Wedgworth prepare for flag racing finals. In the practice pen, Wedgworth also benefits from the expertise of his goat tail untying coach, Heather McLaughlin, a member of the University of West Alabama Tiger Wranglers who finished fifth in the nation in goat tying at the 2021 College National Finals Rodeo in June.<br>All-around titles are awarded to the rodeo competitor who is most successful in two or more events, and Wedgworth was successful in earning points in all four events. Wedgworth really shined in flag racing while competing in the NLBRA Finals in Guthrie the week of July 5.<br>Competing in the Little Wranglers class, Wedgworth won the world title in flag racing, a timed event in which Wedgworth and his horse, Fastback, race to place flags in and out of buckets placed on barrels at the far end of the arena. Wedgworth’s first run was 8.385 seconds in the first round, and he only got faster over the course of the week. His final run in the short round was the fastest recorded time at finals of his age class of 7.737 seconds. Wedgworth finished the event with 1,092 points, an impressive 72 more than his nearest competitor, who was named reserve champion. In the all-around, Wedgworth finished the season with 2,848 points.<br>Wedgworth is the son of Evan and J.J. Wedgworth of Livingston, and the grandson of Bruce and Cindy Cook of Livingston, and Donnie and Karen Wedgworth of Greensboro. Outside of rodeo, he loves to fish, play baseball, and spend time with his family, friends and his three dogs, Haze, Shine and Spur.</p>
