But the notion that anyone could ever skim 12.6 million gallons of oil a day is simply preposterous.<br/> <br/>By the end of the three-month BP spill, the company had managed to skim about 2.8 million gallons. That&#x27;s about 1/500th of the 1.4 billion gallons that BP presumably was ready to deal with over such a span of time.<br/> <br/>The rest of BP&#x27;s 582-page Oil Spill Response Plan wasn&#x27;t much more useful. (One portion offered advice on dealing with walrus and seal populations, of which the Gulf has none.) The plan called for fire booms, but provided no source for obtaining them.<br/> <br/>In fact, the plan was just one more indication that no one ever really imagined a spill on the scale of the BP spill. And it was further evidence that the federal government and BP were inventing a response on the fly.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_RE6BRQAHVVG3LBLXC3GKBDXY7I" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-67"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L6P4JCQX75GLDBIXC3YIVMZ7KQ">The lack of a plan was also evident when it came to figuring out whether the seafood in the Gulf was safe to eat. For reasons I still don&#x27;t understand, federal officials decided to ignore the long-standing safety standards used to protect people from oil-contaminated seafood after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, and other major spills in Oregon, Rhode Island, California and Maine. Instead, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration chose to allow three times more oil in Gulf seafood than had been allowed after past spills.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_L6P4JCQX75GLDBIXC3YIVMZ7KQ" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-68"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UPIFLAPVYBELXM2EVBQ2A75XEQ">For instance, after the New Carissa oil tanker ran aground in Oregon in 1999, the safety standard for shellfish was set at 45 parts per billion for BaPE, which is an estimated total of cancer-causing oil compounds. After a spill in California, the standard was set at 34 parts per billion. But in the Gulf after the BP spill, the FDA set the standard at 132 parts per billion for shrimp and crabs, and 143 parts per billion for oysters.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_UPIFLAPVYBELXM2EVBQ2A75XEQ" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-69"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N5W2DWUBQBHKDHFO4AFPRTPMFA">A primary factor behind the decision to allow more contamination in the Gulf seafood was that the FDA used a one-in-100,000 risk of developing cancer on the Gulf coast. The standards after the California and Oregon spills were based on a one-in-1-million cancer risk factor.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_N5W2DWUBQBHKDHFO4AFPRTPMFA" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-70"></div><figure class="article__image"><div class="article__image-wrapper"><picture><source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcSet="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fadvancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimage.al.com%2Fhome%2Fbama-media%2Fwidth2048%2Fimg%2Falphotos%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F04%2F16%2F17522275-large.jpg?auth=db430c3847547eeb76fc5a0ae832d6ae12ce29e1d2db81c16bf8fb5f043ecb9b&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90 500w"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcSet="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fadvancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimage.al.com%2Fhome%2Fbama-media%2Fwidth2048%2Fimg%2Falphotos%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F04%2F16%2F17522275-large.jpg?auth=db430c3847547eeb76fc5a0ae832d6ae12ce29e1d2db81c16bf8fb5f043ecb9b&amp;width=800&amp;quality=90 800w"/><source srcSet="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fadvancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimage.al.com%2Fhome%2Fbama-media%2Fwidth2048%2Fimg%2Falphotos%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F04%2F16%2F17522275-large.jpg?auth=db430c3847547eeb76fc5a0ae832d6ae12ce29e1d2db81c16bf8fb5f043ecb9b&amp;width=1280&amp;quality=90 1280w"/><img src="https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fadvancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fimage.al.com%2Fhome%2Fbama-media%2Fwidth2048%2Fimg%2Falphotos%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F04%2F16%2F17522275-large.jpg?auth=db430c3847547eeb76fc5a0ae832d6ae12ce29e1d2db81c16bf8fb5f043ecb9b&amp;width=500&amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="article__image-content" height="600" width="300"/></picture><figcaption class="article__image-caption"><p class="article__mm-image-caption-text">A brown pelican covered in oil struggles toward the beach at East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast.
