for 26 years and love working here. Started out in sports covering high schools, then Auburn and Alabama. Enjoyed covering all schools, then became sports editor from 1993-99, when I decided to go into entertainment so I could spend more time with my wonderful daughter, Abbie, who is the love of my life. She now attends Auburn and is a member of Auburn's marching band as a flag girl. I'm very proud of her and love to go watch her play. People say, how can you root for Auburn when you went to Alabama? I say, I support my daughter 100 percent and also support where my money goes, ha. I've lived in Huntsville all my life, blessed to still have my parents and attend Cove United Methodist Church, where I help with the teenagers. It's a great church if you're looking for one and a big part of my life. Other than that, I enjoy all sports and working out.
