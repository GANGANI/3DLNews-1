<p>With New Year&#8217;s Day under their belts, many people are looking forward to a new year. The Franklin County Times, however, is taking a look back, with a review of some of the top headlines from the county in the past year.</p>
<p>Although these stories provide only a taste of the busy year Franklin County had, they are hopefully representative of 2017 and provide an overview of this year’s happenings.</p>

<p><em>Palmer opts to stay in FC</em></p>
<p>After a couple days of deliberation, Franklin County engineer David Palmer decided to turn down an offer from Lawrence County and remain in Franklin. His decision came after the Franklin County Commission voted to offer him a hefty pay raise in October.</p>

                    </div>
                    </div><p>The 3-1 vote resulted in a salary increase for Palmer at the beginning of FY2018 (October 2017) to $163,200; at the beginning of FY2019 (October 2018) to $166,464; and FY2020 (October 2019) to $169,793, through December 2020, representing a four-year contract beginning January 2017. The last three years will put Palmer’s salary in line with the offer from Lawrence County.</p>
<p><em>Vina teacher earns national Teacher of the Week nod</em></p>
<p>American Paper &amp; Twine Co., the Tennessee Titans and Georgia-Pacific Communication Papers announced that Jessica Hamilton, a teacher at Vina High School, was selected as Teacher of the Week for the home opener of the Tennessee Titans 2016 football season. Vina High School parent and coworker Karen Scott nominated Hamilton.</p>
<p><em>EFJHS wins $10K in sweepstakes</em></p>

							</div>
							</div><p>East Franklin Junior High School PTO President Jamie Duboise has made a hobby of entering sweepstakes. When she came across the Campbell’s Grand Stand for Schools $1,000,000 giveaway, she put her sweepstakes skills to work for East Franklin students and teachers.</p>
<p>“At first, whenever they called, we didn’t really know if it was real,” said Principal Nancy Hallman. But the school sent back their tax ID information, and a big “Christmas gift” – a $10K check – soon arrived. “When we got it in the mail, we were really excited.”</p>
<p><em>Community Spirit Bank opens Tiger Branch at RBHS</em></p>
<p>Red Bay High School became the latest school to offer a bank branch on campus, with the introduction of its new Community Spirit Bank branch. Establishing the bank required closing in a breezeway at the school, and the construction, CSB marketing director Emily Mays said, represents “a significant financial investment on behalf of the bank that will aid the school, its staff and students for generations to come. We are grateful to the Franklin County Schools superintendent, school board and Red Bay school administration for giving us the opportunity.”</p>
<p><em>Gas fire burns in Franklin</em></p>
<p>A gas fire exploded on Highway 724 near the Newburg community in Franklin County Jan. 20 and continued to burn for a week.</p>
<p>Three men with Gentry Drilling Company were drilling for water when their equipment hit a natural gas pocket, causing a fiery explosion. The drilling was taking place at a group of new chicken houses on the property in Newburg.</p>
<p>Almost instant ignition set fire to the three men. All suffered burns to their faces and hands and were airlifted to the University of Alabama Birmingham burn unit</p>
<p>According to Tharptown Volunteer Fire Department Chief Doug Coan, firefighters watched the fire every minute to monitor the threat to local residents, both from the fire as well as the gas.</p>
<p><strong>February </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>$9k grant brings new RPD tasers</em></p>
<p>A $9K grant funded some new equipment for the Russellville Police Department. Russellville City Council members approved the submission of the grant, which came through the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, to enable the replacement of some of the RPD’s Tasers. The RPD will purchase the Taser X26P, which is endorsed as the company’s smallest and most compact model of its kind, having been recently redesigned.</p>
<p><em>Archaeological dig comes to Red Bay</em></p>
<p>The City of Red Bay got some “new digs” – literally. Beginning March 1, an archaeological dig took place at Cypress Cove Farm, directed by Red Bay resident Jamie Morrow and Dr. Virgil Beasley. The dig was a follow-up to two that happened around ten years ago at the same area, and with educational grant funding from Rep. Johnny Mack Morrow, students from across Franklin County got the chance to participate.</p>
<p><em>Addie’s Flip, Tip, Tap students score big</em></p>
<p>Members of Russellville’s Addie’s Flip, Tip and Tap Dance Company traveled to Nashville to compete in Showstopper’s 2017 Regional Dance Competition held at the Gaylord Opryland Convention Center. AFTT Company brought several entries to the show. Eight girls from the company entered divisions such as jazz, hip hop, tap, musical theatre and lyrical jazz.</p>
<p>After celebrating individual solo success, the entire company competed in the Super Jazz Category. This group was the only super performance group that scored platinum. They were first place in their division and Top 1st Platinum in group overalls among 30 entries.</p>
<p><em>State board reverses John Pilati pardon</em></p>
<p>According to information provided by the Alabama Attorney General’s office, the State Pardons and Paroles Board decided Feb. 22 to deny pardon application for convicted former Franklin County District Attorney John Frederick Pilati.</p>
<p>The denial extended back to previous partial pardons granted in 2012 and 2015 and voids those pardons. Pilati was convicted in federal court and sentenced in 2008 to 42 months in prison for five civil rights offenses related to sexual assaults on young men who ranged in age from 16-20.</p>
<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<p><em>FCBOE approves $2.5M for Tharptown schools</em></p>
<p>Expansion appeared on the horizon for Tharptown Elementary and Tharptown High schools, with the Franklin Board of Education approving a contractor bid for renovation and addition to TES and THS – with the bid going to RDT Enterprises, in the amount of $2,495,425, with a unanimous vote. The planned addition/renovation includes renovating the current cafeteria, which is used by all Tharptown students, into classrooms for the elementary grades, to limit the need for mobile classroom units – which were made necessary by an explosion in enrollment, both from steady growth of the school over the years as well as an influx of students from the Russellville City Schools system following RCS’ implementation of a tuition policy – as well constructing a new, larger cafeteria for use by all grades.</p>
<p><em>RFD firefighter saves life with quick action</em></p>
<p>Russellville fire fighter Shane Mansell quickly transitioned from bass fishing tournament director to trained EMT when he started talking with a man who was having chest pains during a tourney Mansell was directing. “I could tell he was having an active heart attack,” Mansell said. Although 911 had already been dialed, Mansell called again to request air evacuation and then began to perform CPR.</p>
<p>Mansell was later commended by the Russellville City Council.</p>
<p><em>Thursday storms rip down College Avenue wall</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, “breaking down a wall” is a positive metaphor for building community among different people. In this case, breaking down a wall was literal destruction in Russellville.</p>
<p>The retaining wall bordering the Old College Avenue School and Limestone Street collapsed, with debris spilling out into the roadway, during severe storms in March.</p>
<p>Street superintendent Shannon Wilson said the wall has been leaning for years, and it seemed the rush of water from quick rainfall was finally the final straw.</p>
<p>The city and Russellville City School collaborated to replace the wall with grassy green hillside instead.</p>
<p><em>Local woman receives NAACP award</em></p>
<p>Danyelle Hillman was speechless when she was named the recipient of the 2017 Bringing Out The Best Award, given by the NAACP. “I was flattered that someone would think so highly of me,” she said. “I was at a loss for words. It was quite an honor.” The state-level award recognized her “leadership to change the world one child at a time,” and was presented at the NAACP Gala March 3, held at the Embassy Suites in Montgomery.</p>
<p><strong>April</strong></p>
<p><em>State dismisses ethics complaint against Shewbart</em></p>
<p>It was in November 2016 that Red Bay director of operations Mike Shewbart faced an ethics complaint stemming from actions during his campaign for mayor of Red Bay. April 6, Shewbart was cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p><em>EF-0, microburst hit Franklin</em></p>
<p>Strong storms over the weekend escalated with National Weather Service-confirmed reports of an EF-0 tornado and a microburst in Franklin County. Franklin County Emergency Management Agency Director Jody Hitt said the EF-0 came in western Franklin from Mississippi, crossing the state line and affecting Pleasant Site, Pogo and Freedom Hill communities before leaving the ground around Burnout.

Hitt said about a quarter mile of trees were damaged in this microburst, with multiple trees being snapped and even uprooted.</p>
<p><em>RHS’ Lorraine Perez wins state science teacher award</em></p>
<p>Each year, the Alabama Science Teachers Association selects one elementary, one middle and one high school teacher from across the state to honors with the Outstanding High School Science Teacher Award. This year, the high school recognition went to Russellville High’s Lorraine Perez. “I was really excited,” said Perez. “It just makes me really proud.”</p>
<p>The statewide recognition also came with a $1,000 cash prize for Perez. The award was presented in Birmingham at the McWane Center at the ASTA conference. A testament to her dedication to teaching, Perez was unable to attend the presentation – because she was dedicated to helping her biology students through the AP mock exam, held the same day.</p>

<p><em>New facilities make splash at Red Bay Fun Park</em></p>
<p>It sometimes seems it’s more common for construction projects to finish late than on time – but that wasn’t the case in Red Bay, where a targeted 100-day construction project wrapped up with a month to spare. The city officially opened the doors on its new pool house facilities with a celebratory ribbon cutting at Red Bay Fun Park.</p>
<p>Mayor Charlene Fancher thanked the Red Bay City Council for approving the construction and credited the council of eight years ago for refinancing debt that created a pool of capital improvement funds.</p>
<p><em>Russellville claims third consecutive state championship</em></p>
<p>For the third consecutive year, Russellville High School came away with that blue map as the Golden Tigers defeated the Faith Academy Rams in the best-of-three championship series to claim the state title. Russellville took game one at Paterson Field May 17 by a 9-1 score behind the usual dominating performance on the mound of eventual 5A series MVP Cody Greenhill. On the following day, the scene shifted to Riverwalk Stadium, the home of the Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League of Professional Baseball. Russellville looked to be on the way to finishing off the Rams for the second year in a row, but the team from Mobile had other ideas. Trailing 7-5 in their last at-bat, the Rams scored three runs in the top of the seventh inning to force a game three. The final game saw RHS jump out to a 7-0 lead, and the Golden Tigers held on to win by a 7-4 final score.</p>

<p><em>Russellville utilities rolls out new modern billing system</em></p>
<p>In the early 1970s, Russellville Utilities relied on the billing company Central Service Association to provide billing service to Russellville Utilities customers. After 32 years of doing billing in-house on the same decades-old mainframe system, Russellville Utilities opted to return to using a contract billing service – contracting again with the Central Service Association.</p>
<p>Russellville office manager Pat Seal said the return to working with CSA represents a big leap into the 21<sup>st</sup> century for Russellville Utilities. It’s an upgrade that will soon allow Russellville Utilities to offer online bill pay and will improve effectiveness and productivity in the office, with an eye toward increased customer service.</p>
<p><em>FC ‘Rocks’ painting effort sweeps county</em></p>
<p>In February on a family trip to Florida, Tom and Christina Hamm and their son Hunter were strolling a local park when they happened across a few painted rocks. What was initially an idle curiosity turned out to be a project they realized they just had to replicate in back home in Red Bay and Franklin County. That’s the short version of how the FC “Rocks” came to be.</p>
<p>The “rules” are simple: Paint a rock. Hide the rock in the community. On the other side of the project: Go look for painted rocks. Post pictures of the rocks you find on the Facebook group (if you want). Rehide the rocks (if you want).</p>
<p>Families weren’t the only ones getting involved. Local businesses joined in by hiding prize rocks, promising treats and even cash prizes to those who found and returned specially-marked rocks.</p>

<p><em>Downtown loft apartments open to community Sunday </em></p>
<p>After seven months in the making, Russellville’s first loft apartments were completed in June – and the community was invited to come give them a look.</p>
<p>When Mayor David Grissom first began contemplating the revitalization of downtown Russellville, he said he quickly began to envision loft apartments in the second story of downtown businesses. Once the new zoning guidelines were established downtown to permit loft apartments, he said he decided it was time to put his money where his mouth was. Grissom teamed up with Chris Wallace and, together as Made in USA Properties, they purchased what once-upon-a-time was Reed’s General Store – Grissom’s great-uncle’s store – and began to renovate, with an eye toward developing two apartments on the second floor.</p>
<p><em>Return to Toyland</em></p>
<p>Holiday traditions are often what make the season come alive. The Franklin County Arts and Humanities Council spearheaded the move to bring a beloved holiday tradition of yesteryear back to the spotlight this December.</p>
<p>The musical extravaganza set to take the stage was a reincarnation of “The Legend of Toyland” production that took the stage at Northwest-Shoals Community College for three decades. Playwright Lanny McAlister retired the show after the 2011 performance – but when Hillary Hall and Chase Sparks approached him about doing a rewrite of the show for the Historic Roxy Theatre, they said he readily agreed.</p>
<p>Lanny McAlister’s “The Roxy’s Legend of Toyland” took the Roxy stage in downtown Russellville Nov. 29 through Dec. 3, with ten showings planned, including several performances set aside for schools.</p>

<p><em>Newspaper earns APA awards</em></p>
<p>The Franklin County Times brought home 15 awards in the 2017 Better Newspaper Contest and Advertising Contest through the Alabama Press Association.</p>

<p><em>Three attempt FC jail escape</em></p>
<p>“It could have been worse” was the thought Franklin County Sheriff’s Office investigator Jordan Seahorn was left with following an attempted escape from the Franklin County Jail.</p>
<p>Three inmates, Scott Hawkins, 52, Russellville, Joshua Hollimon, 33, Russellville, and Tony Welborn, 34, Spruce Pine, forced their way past the jailer in a Sunday attempt to escape from the jail, Seahorn said. According to investigators, the jailer was letting Hollimon out to make a phone when, in what investigators said was clearly an orchestrated maneuver, Hawkins and Welborn also forced their way out of the cell, wrested the jailer’s Taser from her and also managed to procure a knife from a secured inmate property area.</p>
<p>Seahorn said the inmates took control of a computer used to access jail doors. The inmates were successful in opening the inner door, but the secondary outer door, Seahorn said, had to be operated by a different computer system. The inmates were unable to activate it – a safety measure, Seahorn said, that operated just the way it was supposed to in order to prevent just this sort of incident.</p>
<p>Inmates allegedly exited the inner door and were apparently going to try to force their way through the outer door when other jail personnel responded to the scene. At that point, according to investigators, Hawkins deployed the Taser at the oncoming officers but did not hit any of them. All three were taken back into custody.</p>
<p><em>CB&amp;S Bank president, CEO retires</em></p>
<p>At the end of July, CB&amp;S Bank President and CEO Dennis Upchurch traded in long hours at the bank for travel, bike rides and a slower pace of life, retiring from the bank after 29 years in his then-current role.</p>
<p>Upchurch came to CB&amp;S Bank as president-elect in 1988 from Valley State Bank, which he had moved to Russellville to help organize.</p>
<p>The Bank announced Mike Ross, a native of Montgomery, as the new president and CEO.</p>

<p>North Alabama was outside the “path of totality” for August’s solar eclipse, but that didn’t stop people across Franklin County from stepping outside to view the unique astronomical spectacle.</p>
<p>Students at Russellville City Schools were among those to witness the cosmic occurrence. Superintendent Heath Grimes called the eclipse “a great educational opportunity for our students.” The school system provided eclipse glasses, thanks to a donation, to all students.</p>
<p>Eclipse glasses were flying off the shelves across the nation, including at Russellville Public Library, where a free glasses giveaway drew people to line up down the block.</p>

<p><em>G&amp;G constructs for NASA</em></p>
<p>It’s not always common knowledge what local industries are doing and creating, but a recent project for G&amp;G Steel garnered wide exposure, as the local industry completed a product for NASA through a contract with Dynetics. G&amp;G Steel vice president Bret Gist said this is the first time the company has ever contracted with Dynetics on a project. The final product is a full-scale model of a Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage, called the Core Stage Pathfinder.</p>
<p>“The size of this project falls in line with many of the USACE projects we do that last about one and a half to two years,” Gist said. “This is a NASA project with a lot of attention.”</p>
<p><em>RCS ‘adopts’ victims in Lumberton, Texas</em></p>

<p><em>Schools band together to help two families</em></p>
<p>It’s a rare sight to see mascots from opposing teams shaking hands and rallying together, but not quite as rare as the genetic disorders Xia-Gibbs and SIOD. The Muscle Shoals Trojan and the Phil Campbell Bobcat united in their efforts to boost support for three students dealing with these disorders, coming together Oct. 19 to kick off a fundraiser.</p>
<p>Students and faculty from both campuses joined together at Phil Campbell, after a separate event earlier at Muscle Shoals, to show support for these students who are afflicted with Xia-Gibbs and SIOD.
