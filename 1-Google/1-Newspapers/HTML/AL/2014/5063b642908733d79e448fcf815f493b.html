<h2>Cybercrimes</h2>
<p>In the digital age, cybercrimes have become increasingly common and concerning. They refer to offenses committed using a computer or the internet. Cybercrimes encompass a wide range of activities, including hacking, identity theft, phishing scams, cyberstalking, and the distribution of child pornography. As our reliance on digital technology continues to grow, so does the prevalence and sophistication of cybercrimes.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="padding-top:3%">Public awareness campaigns</h2>
<p>Public awareness campaigns are used to educate residents about crime prevention strategies and encourage them to take an active role in preventing crime. In Waxahachie, the police department uses social media, billboards, and other advertising channels to promote crime prevention messages. The department also holds community events to engage residents and build relationships.</p>
<br>

<h2 style="padding-top:3%">Public Order Crimes</h2>
<p>Public order crimes, also known as victimless crimes, are offenses that violate laws established to maintain public order. They include prostitution, public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and gambling offenses. While these crimes do not have a clear victim, they are considered detrimental to society's overall order and morality, and thus, are penalized.</p>

<br>
