		<div id="article_header">Early Notification to Pike County Times Readers Is Going Strong at the End of Its 6th Year!<Br />By Editor Becky Watts</div>
<br />

<p>ZEBULON - Pike County Times underwent some changes in 2015. Pike County Times remained FREE--as it has been since 2006 when I began reporting on the Pike County Commission--but I no longer post links to breaking news stories on Facebook as soon as I finish the articles because I send a notice to my Breaking News subscribers by email or text that allows them to read the story before it even goes on my front page. 
</p>


<p><strong>How Long Does It Take to Write and Upload an Article?</strong>
</p>

<p>Do you know how much time it takes to investigate an article and get it written up for Pike County Times? Sometimes it only takes ten or fifteen minutes to pull together a press release and get it online. But sometimes, much more is needed in order to obtain necessary information for an article. 
</p>

<p>Like what? Like talking to someone (and sitting on hold until I could be directed to the right person) in order to get on the FBI's press release list so I could provide information about a bank robbery. Or paying for Open Records, waiting until they are prepared, and carefully reading through that information page by page to put a factual article together. Like going to a crime scene for information or pictures or interviewing law enforcement officers from various agencies. Or attending Board of Commission meetings that occur at least twice a month and following up with the County Manager or other entities within the county to ensure that my questions are answered so readers' answers can be answered too. 
</p>

<p>I ask a LOT of questions, and I don't always accept what I am told at face value. I like something on paper to show me what is going on, and I require documentation or someone's name on information before it goes on my newspaper... because THAT is how I have always rolled.
</p>

<p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong>
</p>

<p>Would you like to help support the time poured into of these articles that you read for free? You can do that with a donation of any amount. And with a yearly donation of $25 or more, you will receive breaking news stories by email or text message as soon as I finish those articles. 
</p>

<p>There is no set number of texts that will go out on a weekly or monthly basis, but you will receive a notification by text or email when these articles go online. However, please understand that there is no set time of the day when you will receive my notification so it may be early in the morning, during the day or late at night--though I usually don't post after midnight! 
</p>

<p>If you would like to support Pike County Times.com with your donation of $25 for this early notification service, please notify me at editor@pikecountytimes.com so I can email an invoice to you, you can download by <a href="http://pikecountytimes.com/secondary/earlynotification3.16.15.doc" target="_new">clicking here</a>, or you can click on the donate button below and type early notification on the donation line as well as your phone number for texts or your email. 
</p>

<p>Pike County Times now accepts PayPal, Square, check, cash or money order--with a written receipt given to the donor, and I can run a credit/debit card donation in person or by over the phone. My phone number is 770-468-7583.
</p>

<p><strong>Thank You for Supporting Pike County's Only FREE Online Newspaper!</strong>
</p>

<p>Any donations above the amount of the $25 will help with the day to day costs of Pike Countyâs only FREE online newspaper. 
</p>

<p>And please drop me a line on Facebook or by email if you would like a bumper sticker or t-shirt for Pike County Times. I have been blessed with almost 15 years of service to Pike County as Pike County's online source for news.
</p>

<p>Thank you for your encouragement and support!
