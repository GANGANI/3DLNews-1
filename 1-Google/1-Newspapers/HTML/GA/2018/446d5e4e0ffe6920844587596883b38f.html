GBI Agent Douglas Motes had a well deserved nickname within the bureau.  It was BH, which stood for Bloodhound, since once he got on a trail he never rested until he ran down his quarry.  

Thus when Shanna departed the Gentlemen’s Club at about 10:15 that night, he was across the street sitting in his car patiently waiting.  He followed her southward through the downtown connector. 

South of the city, when the red Corvette veered onto I-85 South, his heart quickened as he realized his hunch had been correct—she had been informed and was making a run for it. The information had to have been given to her inside the Gentlemen’s Club, because she had gone to work as usual, and then suddenly left.

Agent Motes felt a slight sense of panic when he saw the Corvette’s brake lights come on as it passed underneath the sign indicating the airport exit was just ahead.  He knew then she was on her way to catch a plane.  Either he had to trump up some kind of charge to arrest her, or get on the plane with her.

At that instant the Corvette exploded.  It suddenly turned into a bright orange ball of hellfire and disintegrated before his eyes.  Agent Motes attempted to duck as a burning hunk of metal ricocheted off the hood of his car and crashed through the windshield.  Fortunately for him it came through on the passenger’s side.
  
He could feel the extreme heat and smell the distinctive odder of burning metal as he stood on his brake and turned hard toward the right shoulder of the freeway in order to avoid crashing into the flaming mass in front of him.  His car went into a skid slightly to the right.  hen when the car behind him rear-ended his, the impact put his car into a spin.  The last thing he remembered was the thunderous sound of his car slamming into the concrete abutment of the bridge above him.

It was Monday morning, the last day of July, and Chris Adams had a slight headache from a weekend of celebrating.  He fumbled around in the center drawer of his desk where he finally found two Advils just before Jones stuck his head through his office door and said, “Hey, buddy.  How you feeling?”

“Not too great,” Chris replied.

Just before closing the door Jones said, “You’ll feel better at ten o’clock.  
See you in about 15 minutes.”

Chris washed down the pills with a large swallow of ice cold Diet Coke and began to spread he morning newspaper out on his desk.  He was anxious to get to the paper.

He had been closely following the stories concerning the Gentlemen’s Club.  The charges had escalated beyond the original ones.  They now included bribery, blackmail and murder.  Also, several policemen, lawyers, and even a judge had been implicated and would be facing criminal charges.  And his new friend, Agent Motes, even though he had suffered a broken arm and a bad concussion, was intricately involved in the investigations.

Chris was sorry about Shanna.  The relationship had developed because of him, not her.  Because of his work, he had had no woman in his life and had ended up at the Gentlemen”s Club looking for love in the wrong place.  After Agent Motes had related all the details leading up to Shanna’s demise, he had anonymously paid for all her final arrangements.

Chris folded the front section of the paper and was searching for the sports section when his phone rang.  It was Patty.  “Hey, everything’s ready.  I’ll see you in the conference room.  All I need are the signatures.”

Patty had been working very hard  to see that Rick Junior received his rightful inheritance.  And today, she had completed the paperwork that would make Pic-Ric Products a three-way partnership between Chris, Jones and Rick Junior.

Chris stood up, stretched, and surveyed his desktop, which was strewn with reports and forms, all of which needed his attention.

“I’ll take care of all this later,” he thought to himself.  Right now it was time to go become a billionaire.

Note from the author: Writing Rich Revenge, The Second Doublewide on the Right and Playing Dead, has been a labor of love.  I hope my readers enjoyed reading them as much as I did writing them.  But now I have to say goodbye to Jasper County, Monticello and Lake Jackson, to begin a new phase of my life.  My eternal gratitude is extended to The Monticello News, to my friend and editor Kathy Mudd, for publishing my scribbling, and to Jenny and Susan for putting up with my bad jokes.  So long to all my friends and neighbors of the last 25 years.  But who knows, one day I might just show up at the Sac-O-Suds!

Shanna Martin breathed a long sigh of defeat as she was being led toward Joey Sitka’s office.  She knew very well that if Joey called, you went. She just hoped and prayed it wasn’t some special assignment.  She was too busy to have to fly off to Houston, Miami, or some other far off city to entertain some rich jerk.  She had taken a Xanax on her drive to work and had another one stashed for later.  All she wanted to do was dance to the music until closing time, go home, and go to sleep thinking about Chris and wake up tomorrow and start planning their future.

When she was ushered into Joey’s office, he was sitting stone-faced behind his desk and in a gruff voice ordered her to sit down.  “This won’t take long,” he told her.

Breathlessly Shanna blurted out, “Joey, I can’t travel tonight-----”

“Shut up!” he demanded.  “You’re going to travel all right, but it won’t be for work.  I want you to get your stuff together and clear yourself out of this club in no less than 10 minutes!”

Shanna was struck dumb, but for only a moment before she said, “Joey! why-why are you firing me?”

“I’m not firing you, I’m doing you a favor.”

Shanna, hanging on the edge of her seat pleaded, “But, Joey, what have I done?  I don’t understand!”

“Then let me briefly explain,” Joey said.  “The damn GBI was at the county courthouse today trying to get a murder warrant for your arrest.  The judge put them off until tomorrow, but from the evidence he says they have, he’ll have no choice but to sign it tomorrow. 

“I know what will happen next—those conniving cops will burst in here tomorrow night during our busiest time and slap a pair of handcuffs on you.  They’ll bring along reporters with cameras and we’ll be on the front page of the damn newspaper again.  I can’t let that happen, Shanna.  I’ve already been charged with money laundering, credit card fraud, prostitution, and the’ll probably cook up some more charges before it’s over.  They want to close my club, take away my liquor license and throw me into jail------”

Joey kept rambling on while  Shanna was wondering how could anyone possibly know what she had done.

But Joey wasn’t rambling, he was killing time.  He looked at his watch just before he handed Shanna a single piece of paper.  “Take this.  It’s the name and phone number of a friend of mine in New Orleans.  He’ll put you to work and give you a new ID.  It’s no problem to get lost in the Big Easy.  But you have to leave tonight.  It’s your only chance.  You got any money?”
Shanna shook her head no, and in a trembling voice said,  “I don’t have much on me, but I’ve got about $60 thousand in my checking account.” 

Joey pulled the center drawer of his desk open and extracted a fat envelope.  “Here’s two grand to get you by.  Write me a check for the $60 thousand and we’ll clean out the account first thing tomorrow morning and I’ll forward it on to you later, otherwise they’ll freeze the account.”

Shanna just sat there in a frozen and shocked state.  It was too much for her absorb at once.

Joey shouted out her name to break her from her shocked state.  “Shanna! I’m trying to help you here.  If you don’t do as I tell you and leave immediately there’s a good chance you’ll never make it.  The cops will arrest you and freeze all your assets.  You could lose your home, your money and your freedom!”

Bob, the bouncer, returned to the office just as Shanna had completed writing the check.  

Joey took it from her hand and said, “Bob will help you gather your stuff and walk you to your car.  Delta flight 897 departs for New Orleans at 11:15.  It’s wide open.  Be on it.  Good luck, Shanna.”  

Five minutes later Bob returned to Joey’s office and said, “It’s done, boss.”
“She have any final words to say,” Joe asked him.

“Just wanted to know about her car.  I told her to leave the keys under the floor mat and we would pick it up and dispose of it.”

 “So she’s gone?”

“Yep.  I watched her drive away myself.”

“Good,” Joey declared.  “What time do you think it will happen?”

“I would estimate about two minutes before she gets to the airport.”

After Bob left his office, Joey sat staring at the check with a smile on his face.  The money was his consolation for having to give up a good employee.  If anyone questioned it, he would say it represented the repayment of a loan.  He had no idea who Shanna was supposed to have murdered, and he didn’t care.  However, he did know he couldn’t afford to have an employee charged with such  serious crime.  He also knew that sooner or later the cops would catch her, and no matter where it was, it would still be connected with the club.  That’s why he had had Bob place the bomb in her car.

Chris Adams tore his eyes from the list of names, looked Agent Motes in the eyes and slowly nodded his head.

With obvious satisfaction and excitement, Agent Motes stammered, “Wh-wh-which one?”

“This one,” Chris softly said as he took his pen and drew a circle around it.
Agent Motes let out a sigh of satisfaction as he said, “Just as I thought.  Now Mr. Adams, would you please tell me----” Agent Motes stopped in mid-sentence while he glanced back and forth between Chris and Patty before he continued: Perhaps you would prefer to finish this discussion in private?”  

Chris cringed slightly and said, while looking directly into Patty’s eyes, “No, I have nothing to hide from anyone.  Please continue.”

It had taken Agent Motes a few moments to establish in his mind that Chris had had a relationship with the suspect, but had ended it and was now in a what appeared to be a very close relationship with Patty.  

He leaned back in his chair, let out yet another sigh of satisfaction before he said, “Thank you Mr. Adams.  I now have a motive.”

“Huh?  I don’t get it,” Chris said.

“I’ll explain,” Agent Motes said, “but first I need to warn you that this woman had your house staked out last night.  I believe she drowned that woman at the lake because she was attempting to take your livelihood away, and I also believe she intends to murder Ms. Osborn because she took you away.  So you see Mr. Adams, you are the motive. I just wish I had more concrete evidence placing her at the crime scene.  Our eyewitness never actually saw a face.”

 “I think I might know a way,” Chris volunteered.

Agent Motes’ eyes grew large when he said, “How’s that?”

“Finger prints,” Chris told him.  If you’ll go to my partner’s lake house, three doors west of the one the drowned woman was staying in, you’ll find a green ceramic frog on the deck next to the chimney under a table, which keeps it dry.  I’ll wager you’ll find her prints on the frog, and while you’re at it, you could probably find them on my license plate as well.”

“Dang!” Agent Motes blurted out. “I wish you worked for me, Mr. Adams.  Now I have some work to do.”

As he rose up out of his chair Agent Motes paused and said, “Uh, just one more thing before I go---I wouldn’t let Ms. Osborn go anywhere alone, at least not until we can gather the evidence and apprehend the Martin woman.”

Agent Martin spent the remainder of the day going through the technicalities of obtaining an arrest warrant for Shanna Martin. however, much to his consternation, he was informed that Judge Hollis Garrett wouldn’t be available to sign the warrant until tomorrow morning.  When he received this information and heard the name of the judge, he immediately became suspicious because he knew one of his fellow agents was working undercover in an attempt to expose Judge Garrett for taking bribes.

Later on that day, well after darkness had fallen, Shanna was once again parked near Chris’s driveway with her loaded gun.  The time dragged on agonizingly slow while she kept imagining what the two of them were doing inside.  It wouldn’t be long before she would be the one on the inside looking out.  It would be her cooking his dinner, straightening his tie, awakening with him every morning and bringing his coffee to him.

She was forced to abandon her stalking of Patty and her daydreaming of Chris when the digital number on the clock in the dash of her car told her it was time to go to work.  A few minutes later Shanna arrived at the Gentlemen’s Club, parked in the designated area in the back, and was just entering the building when one of the bouncers suddenly blocked her path and said, “Hey, Shanna, the boss wants to see you.”

“But I’m due on the floor in five minutes,” she protested.

“Don’t matter,” the menacing bouncer told her.  “He said to bring you to his office as soon as you showed up.  Now, follow me.”

Presently, at Shanna’s swimming pool, a dark cloud slid beneath the hot sun.  She welcomed the relief from the heat, but then it began to rain.  She quickly gathered everything up, dashed inside, and went directly to her bedroom where she threw her towel on the bed and stretched out on top of it while she gazed at the poster on the wall.  It was a snapshot of Chris which she had had blown up.  

On the table in front of it, like a shrine, lay the key card to a hotel room they had shared in New Orleans, a cocktail napkin with a silly poem he had written her, the receipt from their first dinner, and a rumpled dress shirt he had left on his last visit.  Slowly she drifted off to sleep.

When she woke up it was almost dark outside.  She bounded to her feet and quickly changed into a sweat suit and sneakers.  Searching around, she found her cell phone, make-up kit, wallet and her handgun.  She tossed everything into a tote bag.

Glancing at her watch as she left the house, she saw that it was almost nine o’clock.  

Thirty minutes later Shanna was parked next to the curb 50 yards from Chris’ driveway.  She reclined in her seat slightly and wiggled into a comfortable position.  “Now, man-stealer,” she thought, “don’t you have to run out to the grocery store, or something?”

GBI Agent Douglas Motes had briefed his superiors on the case and received permission to put Patty Osborn under surveillance.  He had also canvassed all the major rental car agencies and accumulated a list of 11 names of people who had rented black Mustangs on the day when Jackie had been murdered.  

So there he was, parked on the street about a 100 yards from Chris and Patty’s driveway, studying the list of names he had obtained from the rental car agencies with a penlight when he saw the red Corvette pull over to the curb 50 yards down from him.  He watched the car’s lights go off and went back to studying his list.  A minute later he realized no one had gotten out of the red car.  He immediately cut the penlight off and concentrated on the Corvette.  It was too dark to make out the license plate number so he decided to just watch and wait.

An hour and a half later the car suddenly roared to life.  Agent Motes waited until the Corvette’s lights disappeared around the corner before beginning his pursuit.

He almost lost her two times, but after the second time he caught up with her close enough to get the car’s license plate number, which was just before it turned onto the street leading towards The Gentlemen’s Club.

Agent Motes ceased the pursuit at this point and pulled into the parking lot of a strip mall and called the license plate number into the state department of motor vehicles.

A few moments later, when he heard the name in which the red Corvette was registered, he snatched up the list of names he had gathered from the rental car agencies.  When his eyes locked on the same name as the Corvette was registered, he said to himself, “Bingo!”

The following Wednesday morning Chris and Patty arrived at work to find Agent Motes awaiting them in the reception area.  He immediately arose from his seat when they walked in the door and said, “Good morning Ms. Osborn and Mr. Adams.  I wonder if I could have just a few minutes of your time?”  

Chris could sense the excitement in the agent’s voice, which immediately made him curious.  “Of course,” Chris replied and invited him to follow them to Patty’s office, since it was closer, and cleaner.

Once the three of them were comfortably seated Chris asked, “So, Agent Motes, have you found the killer yet?”

Without any hesitation Agent Motes replied, “I have a prime suspect, but I need a motive. That’s why I’m here, hoping one or both of you might be able to help me in establishing one.”

“How can we do that?” Patty inquired.

“By taking a look at this list of names,” Agent Motes said as he handed each of them a sheet of paper.  These are the people who rented a black Mustang on the date of the homicide.  Please tell me if you recognize the name of anyone on that list.”

Chris was still staring at the list with a stunned expression on his face when he heard Patty say, “I’ve never heard of any of these people.”

Agent Motes turned to Chris and said, “How about you. Mr Adams?”
