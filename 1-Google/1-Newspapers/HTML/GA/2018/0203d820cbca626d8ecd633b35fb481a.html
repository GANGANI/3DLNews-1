It's about 100 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The city was established in 1762.<br /> It is the home of the University of Virginia and its nearly 22,000 students.</p><p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"></p><p class="story-text " data-index="11"><b>What led to the violence that day?</b></p><div class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="13">The impending removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was the reason white nationalists and neo-Nazi organizations came to Charlottesville in mid-August.<br /> It wasn't the first time there had been a protest over the statue's removal. In May 2017, white supremacist Richard B. Spencer led a rally to protest the statue's removal. The following day, counterprotesters held a candlelight vigil.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="14">Two months later, on July 8, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/kkk-rally-charlottesville-robert-e-lee-statue.html" target="_self">the Ku Klux Klan rallied in Charlottesville</a> over the plan to remove Lee's statue and the renaming of the park in which it sits. Klan members clashed with counterprotesters, and police arrested 23 people.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="15">The Unite the Right rally would again see Spencer, white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups in Charlottesville to protest the planned removal of the Lee statue – featuring the Confederate general astride his horse, Traveller – that has stood in the city since 1924. Only this time, there was a large number of counterprotesters present, and the two groups wound up facing each other in the streets.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="16">Here is a timeline of the events that led to the violent clash on Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="17"><b>Friday, Aug. 11</b></p><div class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><div class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="20">Rumors began on Friday afternoon that the Unite the Right rally would have a surprise early start on Friday night. The rumors proved true when around 8:45 p.m., about 250 men dressed in khakis and carrying Tiki torches began to gather at an area behind UVA’s Memorial Gymnasium called Nameless Field.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="21">The men were arranged in formation, two by two. Organizers instructed the group to head to the university’s Rotunda, where a statue of Thomas Jefferson stands. As they moved across campus, they began to chant “blood and soil,” a Nazi slogan meant to emphasize the racial purity of the people of German blood and their connection to a German homeland.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="22">By 9 p.m., the group was making its way up the lawn and to the Jefferson statue.</p><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div><p class="story-text " data-index="24">It was there that they ran into resistance when about 30 UVA students met them at the base of the statute.</p><div class="c-section"><div class="story-interscroller__placeholder full-width c-clear-both c-contentElements"></div></div><p class="story-text " data-index="26">The group had locked arms and stood in a circle around the statue at its base. The 250 marchers encircled the students and began shouting, "White lives matter!" and making monkey sounds.<br /> Moments later, the two sides were shoving each other, and then punches and torches were being thrown.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="27">Several minutes passed before university police arrived at the Rotunda.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="28">While there were injuries on both sides, it was only a precursor to what would happen on Saturday.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="29"><b>Saturday, Aug. 12</b></p><p class="story-text " data-index="30"><b>8 a.m.-10:30 a.m.</b></p><div class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="32">The rally was set for Saturday from noon until 5 p.m. in downtown Charlottesville at Emancipation Park, where Lee’s statue stands. By 8 am., Emancipation Park (its named was changed in June 2017 from Market Street Park, which was formerly Lee Park) began to fill. People were coming in the park, holding white nationalist banners and Nazi flags, many carrying sticks and some carrying handguns or long guns. Virginia is an open-carry state, meaning you can openly carry a firearm in public where it can be seen by others.</p><div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="33"><div class="image-component-image inline"><div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"><div class="lazyload-wrapper"><picture class="" style="display:none"><source srcSet="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/LYBYiuxWL2HXU11ID7ikwAqrnUI=/1022x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/HUYPCDLS6BAQ6UKF7R5VWKJBUA.jpg" media="(min-width: 1200px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/LYBYiuxWL2HXU11ID7ikwAqrnUI=/1022x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/HUYPCDLS6BAQ6UKF7R5VWKJBUA.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"/><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/FC8Fexl8MpUBOl0jTiAs4lC9iO0=/800x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/HUYPCDLS6BAQ6UKF7R5VWKJBUA.jpg" alt="CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA - AUGUST 12:  White nationalist Richard Spencer (C) and his supporters clash with Virginia State Police in Emancipation Park after the &quot;Unite the Right&quot; rally was declared an unlawful gathering August 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Many in those ranks also carried sticks.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="35">By 9:30, the counterprotesters were joined by civil rights activists, Charlottesville residents and church members. As they entered the park, the groups began to form up on one side or the other, and words were being exchanged. To the chants of "our blood, our soil," a group of church leaders responded by singing, "This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine."<br /> In the middle of the two groups was a militia force that had begun to form up in the park. They, too, were armed and were clad in camouflage. The leader of the self-styled group told one reporter that area law enforcement was happy to see them there. They wanted to help keep the peace, they said.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="36">By 10:30, the groups were restless and some physical violence – pushing and shoving -- had started. Police officers were stationed along the sides of the park but did not intervene. By this time, people from both sides of the rally were entering the park through the Market Street entrance and yelling at each other as they came in.</p><div class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="38">Charlottesville Police Chief Al S. Thomas Jr. would later tell The Washington Post that rally-goers had abandoned the plan to come into the park through only one entrance.

YORK (AP) — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> became the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes Thursday as a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through hush money payments to a porn actor who said the two had sex."},{"_id":"RHQ574HANRHKBKFS5ZEAGW5XXY","type":"text","content":"Jurors deliberated for 9.5 hours over two days before convicting Trump of all 34 counts he faced. Trump sat stone-faced while the verdict was read as cheering from the street below — where supporters and detractors of the former president were gathered — could be heard in the hallway on courthouse's 15th floor where the decision was revealed."},{"_id":"EGH2QC4YNRDBPNEKCVT6BPHS5A","type":"text","content":"“This was a rigged, disgraceful trial,” Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. “The real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people. They know what happened, and everyone knows what happened here.”"},{"_id":"YEPZR5K2QFCMHCIADCCMRJVLZM","type":"text","content":"The verdict is a stunning legal reckoning for Trump and exposes him to potential prison time in the city where his manipulations of the tabloid press helped catapult him from a real estate tycoon to reality television star and ultimately president. As he seeks to reclaim the White House in this year’s election, the judgment presents voters with another test of their willingness to accept Trump’s boundary-breaking behavior."},{"_id":"6FV3XUF5CRB5RI5EWQMGDEKPTE","type":"text","content":"Trump is expected to quickly appeal the verdict and will face an awkward dynamic as he returns to the campaign trail as a convicted felon. There are no campaign rallies on the calendar for now, though he’s expected to hold fundraisers next week. Judge Juan Merchan set sentencing for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Republican leaders who remained resolute in their support in the immediate aftermath of the verdict are expected to formally make him their nominee."},{"_id":"MEDZEDN4VJFSDFGVVWQEZM4JKI","type":"text","content":"The falsifying business records charges carry up to four years behind bars, though prosecutors have not said whether they intend to seek imprisonment, and it is not clear whether the judge — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hush-money-trial-gag-order-fae616037d3606cc60abbffb0e91f7ee\">who earlier in the trial warned of jail time for gag order violations</a> — would impose that punishment even if asked. The conviction, and even imprisonment, will not bar Trump from continuing his pursuit of the White House."},{"_id":"YQBDY7AUJRECVN5THC3GN4TTBA","type":"text","content":"Trump faces <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/\">three other felony indictments</a>, but the New York case may be the only one to reach a conclusion before the November election, adding to the significance of the outcome. Though the legal and historical implications of the verdict are readily apparent, the political consequences are less so given its potential to reinforce rather than reshape already-hardened opinions about Trump."},{"_id":"SQRHITGZJNEPFB6YRJHMHVBJ3A","type":"text","content":"For another candidate in another time, a criminal conviction might doom a presidential run, but Trump's political career has endured through <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-riots-trials-impeachments-b245b52fd7d4a079ae199c954baba452\">two impeachments</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db\">allegations of sexual abuse</a>, investigations into everything from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ac945e1c9ff24e5eb745eb76c5bd8a2a\">potential ties to Russia</a> to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc\">plotting to overturn an election</a>, and personally salacious storylines <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-access-hollywood-hush-money-new-york-2c52279a45ede2a111ff1fe447d2fdac\">including the emergence of a recording in which he boasted about grabbing women's genitals</a>."},{"_id":"V53SL6A3WZF3FM7ZN3KUV5QHYM","type":"text","content":"In addition, the general allegations of the case have been known to voters for years and, while tawdry, are widely seen as less grievous than the allegations he faces in three other cases that charge him with subverting American democracy and mishandling national security secrets."},{"_id":"JGD4SWKLRVCNBHUUAQSOQ23FLI","type":"text","content":"Even so, the verdict is likely to give President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats space to sharpen arguments that Trump is unfit for office, even as it provides fodder for the presumptive Republican nominee to advance his unsupported claims that he is victimized by a criminal justice system he insists is politically motivated against him."},{"_id":"S6LUNBFOIVAPPD5DAF76Q5FB24","type":"text","content":"Trump maintained throughout the trial that he had done nothing wrong and that the case should never have been brought, railing against the proceedings from inside the courthouse — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-speaker-mike-johnson-court-09aef3de395fa77843f2600f40da6ac3\">where he was joined by a parade of high-profile Republican allies</a> — and racking up fines for violating a gag order with inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses."},{"_id":"HMQLFX265JDFTK6IWGXSNIIQ7E","type":"text","content":"Republicans showed no sign of loosening their embrace of the party leader, with House Speaker Mike Johnson releasing a statement lamenting what he called “a shameful day in American history.” He called the case \"a purely political exercise, not a legal one.”"},{"_id":"XNY4Y2PWAJHF5HNPP5PQLCDBHU","type":"text","content":"The first criminal trial of a former American president always presented a unique test of the court system, not only because of Trump’s prominence but also because of his relentless verbal attacks on the foundation of the case and its participants. But the verdict from the 12-person jury marked a repudiation of Trump’s efforts to undermine confidence in the proceedings or to potentially impress the panel with a show of GOP support."},{"_id":"XK3KSMAZOFGOZB625A4R7PUQNU","type":"text","content":"The trial involved charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up hush money payments to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-gag-order-d853768fff5fafbdee55623579889140\">Stormy Daniels</a>, the porn actor who said she had sex with the married Trump in 2006."},{"_id":"PE3XCZJPLNDX3GBTNHOXNW7P44","type":"text","content":"The $130,000 payment was made by Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-cohen-hush-money-stormy-daniels-735aadfd1ce015e05ba955c203a96f1b\">Michael Cohen</a> to buy Daniels' silence during the final weeks of the 2016 race in what prosecutors allege was an effort to interfere in the election. When Cohen was reimbursed, the payments were recorded as legal expenses, which prosecutors said was an unlawful attempt to mask the true purpose of the transaction. Trump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for legal services."},{"_id":"IMOMPEOAXRHCBCVN35BEESA4ZU","type":"text","content":"Trump has denied the sexual encounter, and his lawyers argued during the trial that his celebrity status, particularly during the 2016 campaign, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels-cohen-9be06e3d33c25af7060552a44001cc1a\">made him a target for extortion</a>. They've said hush money deals to bury negative stories about Trump were motivated by personal considerations such as the impact on his family and brand as a businessman, not political ones. They also sought to undermine the credibility of Cohen, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-michael-cohen-74aaf72511d64fceb1d64529207bde64\">the star prosecution witness who pleaded guilty in 2018</a> to federal charges related to the payments, as driven by personal animus toward Trump as well as fame and money."},{"_id":"U6WFKTCNFNFIZK27BNMDKJ6ZG4","type":"text","content":"The trial featured more than four weeks of occasionally riveting testimony that revisited an already well-documented chapter from Trump's past, when his 2016 campaign was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-access-hollywood-hush-money-new-york-2c52279a45ede2a111ff1fe447d2fdac\">threatened by the disclosure of an \"Access Hollywood\"</a> recording that captured him talking about grabbing women sexually without their permission and the prospect of other stories about Trump and sex surfacing that would be harmful to his candidacy."},{"_id":"B53WXBZ47ZCADFYKVTUXFZNP74","type":"text","content":"Trump himself did not testify, but jurors heard his voice through a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hush-money-trial-new-fines-testimony-trump-fe6995afbc96650b67f46d813ab05f06\">secret recording of a conversation</a> with Cohen in which he and the lawyer discussed a $150,000 hush money deal involving a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who has said she had an affair with Trump: \"What do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\" Trump was heard saying on the recording made by Cohen."},{"_id":"ETJY4MSTHRDE5LK5LDGTGWGQAU","type":"text","content":"<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-stormy-daniels-c69d54c51e2fccbbc0b19e2220222b0e\">Daniels herself testified</a>, offering at times a graphic recounting of the sexual encounter she says they had in a hotel suite during a Lake Tahoe golf tournament.
