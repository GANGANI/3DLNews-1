<p>8. UNFINISHED BUSINESS
</p>

<p>a. PUBLIC HEARING: To receive public input regarding REZ-18-04 â John W. Edwards, Jr., Allie E. Armistead, and Laurie E. Fisher, property owners and applicants, are requesting a rezoning of the subject property from A-R (Agricultural-Residential) to P-I (Professional-Institutional) in order to develop a Veterans Administration Medical Clinic. Proposed zoning decision relates to or will allow the location of relocation of a halfway house, drug rehabilitation center, or other facility for treatment of drug dependency on the subject property (other facility). The subject property, located off of U.S. Hwy. 19 North, has approximately 1370 feet of total frontage along the eastern side of U.S. Hwy. 19 North. The subject property is located in Land Lots 224 and 225 of the 8th District of Pike County, Georgia. The total property area consists of 30.70 acres and is further identified as Tax Map Parcels #066 052 and 066 054. If approved, a separate Overlay District hearing will be required for this rezoning application.
<br />Action: Discuss/Approve/Deny
</p>

<p>CM Morton said that Item B is the adjoining property and said that they could consider the two adjoining properties together. State law requires that because the use may include rehabilitation services for veterans, there was a 6 month waiting period before the rezoning decision could be made. 
</p>

<p>b. PUBLIC HEARING: To receive public input regarding REZ-18-05 âJAASEE Holdings, LLLP, property owner and applicant, are requesting a rezoning of the subject property from A-R (Agricultural-Residential) to P-I (Professional-Institutional) in order to develop a Veterans Administration Medical Clinic. Proposed zoning decision relates to or will allow the location of relocation of a halfway house, drug rehabilitation center, or other facility for treatment of drug dependency on the subject property (other facility). The subject property, located off of U.S. Hwy. 19 North, has approximately 260 feet of total frontage along the eastern side of U.S. Hwy. 19 North. The subject property is located in Land Lots 224 and 225 of the 8th District of Pike County, Georgia. The total property area consists of 16.16 acres and is further identified as Tax Map Parcel #066 054A. If approved, a separate Overlay District hearing will be required for this rezoning application.
<br />Action: Discuss/Approve/Deny
</p>

<p>CM Morton said that item b is the adjoining property and said that they could consider the two adjoining properties together. State law requires that because the use may include rehabilitation services for veterans, there was a 6 month waiting period before the rezoning decision could be made. 
</p>

<p>
Chairman asked the Board what they wanted to do. Consensus to do both together. Brad said that we are hearing the actual rezoning today. This is a requirement for acceptance of the VA, but the VA has not made a decision on this clinic. This would also be ok for a doctorâs office, etc. Both will be combined into one parcel and the overlay district rules will apply to this.
</p>

<p>PUBLIC HEARING:</p>

<p>
Butch Armistead said that this will be 68,000 feet of office space. We expect it to be from 6-8 acres in size. Sewage can be run from the City of Zebulon. It would have to be annexed into the City of Zebulon. He called it âOur Amazon.â
</p>

<p>No one in opposition. Closed public hearing.
</p>

<p>
Motion to approve both. Approved 5-0.
</p>


<p>c. Consider award of Painting Bid for courthouse.
</p>

<p>Received two bids on this previously. Lowest bid was $34,000. Chose to readvertise. Another bid was received. CM Morton received it. 
</p>

<p>RBSC Technology Solutions out of Thomaston. Ronald Bailey is the owner and CEO.
$23,500 is the estimate. Appears to meet all of the specifications. You can either receive the bid or go ahead and take action.
</p>

<p>Daniel said that we did what we intended to do and save some money. We saved at least $10,000 by putting it back out there. Motion to accept their bid and give them the bid. Approved 5-0.
</p>

<p>d. Approve/deny final plat for SUB-18-05.
</p>

<p>Brad Vaughn said that this is the White Horse Subdivision on Beeks Road. 31 houses. The only difference with the before and today is the retention pond. Everything has been satisfied. Recommend for final approval. 3 acres in question will be deeded to the county upon final approval for a county fire station. 
</p>

<p>Motion to approve the final plat. Approved 5-0.
</p>

<p>9. NEW BUSINESS
</p>

<p>
a. Approve/deny renewal of alcohol license (Retail Sales â beer and wine) for Jason Mask d/b/a Frankâs Filling Station, 6764 Hwy. 362, Concord, GA. Applicant has met criteria.
</p>

<p>This item was initially skipped. Chairman Johnson apologized for skipping this item and went back to it after completing Items b and c. Motion to approve. Approved 5-0.
</p>

<p>b. Approve/deny annual CIE update.
</p>

<p>Been working to get accurate numbers on this. Rob said that this is for last year. It goes from November 1 to October 31. We have to look back and see what was actually done. Brad found some numbers that should have been identified 2 years ago that are being reported now. This is a public hearing on the draft that will be transmitted to the state for their approval. It will then be considered for a final approval in the December 12 meeting. This is how this process works. No refunds were issued and there were some expenditures. No transfers. No corrections of errors. The final balance is $495,498 in our Impact Fees. This money is kept separate from other money in the county. Our Comprehensive Plan runs through 2020. Three Rivers will look this over and give us their thoughts on it. 
</p>

<p>PUBLIC HEARING
</p>

<p>No one to speak in favor or against. Closed public hearing.
</p>

<p>Rob asked to consider sending the draft to the state. Motion to approve the transmittal of this document. Approved 5-0.
</p>

<p>10. PUBLIC COMMENT - None
</p>

<p>11. EXECUTIVE SESSION
</p>

<p>
a. Interim County Manager requests Executive Session for discussion or deliberation on the appointment, employment, compensation, hiring, disciplinary action or dismissal, or periodic evaluation or rating of a county officer or employee as provided in O.C.G.A. Â§ 50-14-3(6) germane to the County Manager.
</p>

<p>Executive Session at 9:43 a.m.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Motion to adjourn at 10:17 a.m.
