        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">The May 22 General Primary and Nonpartisan General Election is over, and Union County voters have spoken &ndash; the ESPLOST has passed.</p>
      <p>This is the fifth consecutive time Union County voters have approved the ESPLOST, and the referendum won the day with 69.65 percent of the vote. All told, 3,753 people voted for it and 1,635 people voted against it.</p>
      <p>The countywide sales tax will remain at 7 cents on the dollar when ESPLOST IV collections end June 30 and ESPLOST V collections begin July 1.</p>
      <p>ESPLOST is a 1-cent sales tax collected by schools for the purposes of building new facilities, renovating existing facilities, upgrading HVAC systems, adding to aging bus fleets, updating technology and more.</p>
      <p>The tax features a $21 million collection cap over the next five years.</p>
      <p>In the May 22 Republican Primary, Incumbent Matt Gurtler defeated challenger Mickey Cummings to win re-election in the Georgia House of Representatives District 8 race.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I want to say thank you to the voters from the bottom of my heart,&rdquo; said Rep. Gurtler on Election Night.</p>
      <p>Regarding his mandate, Rep. Gurtler said that he&rsquo;s ready to continue leading by example down in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear, the people have spoken &ndash; they want a guy that&rsquo;s going to go down there and be conservative and stand up for the people and not the establishment,&rdquo; said Rep. Gurtler. </p>
      <p>District 8 consists of Union, Towns and Rabun counties, as well as a portion of White County, and Gurtler won the district with 60.18 percent of the vote to Cummings&rsquo; 39.82 percent.</p>
      <p>In Union, Towns, Rabun and White counties respectively, Gurtler received 54.32, 66.41, 62.75 and 71.36 percent of the vote for a total of 5,965 votes; and Cummings received 45.68, 33.59, 37.25 and 28.64 percent of the vote for a total of 3,947 votes.</p>
      <p>As Gurtler has no Democratic opposition, he will be sworn in to office for his second term in 2019.</p>
      <p>At the local level, three Union County Board of Education seats were on the line, though Incumbent Patrick White ran unopposed for District 5.</p>
      <p>For County Board of Education District 2, Republican Incumbent Tony Hunter received 68.07 percent of the vote with 2,790 votes to defeat challenger Joan Anderson, who received 1,309 votes.</p>
      <p>For County Board of Education District 4, Republican Incumbent Keith Potts won the contest with 64.44 percent of the vote, defeating William McQuillan&rsquo;s 15.52 vote percentage and John T. Strickland&rsquo;s 20.03 vote percentage.</p>
      <p>No Democrats qualified to run against the Republican candidates for school board, which means that Hunter, Potts and White are all set to be sworn in to office at the start of 2019.</p>
      <p>In other race results, both locally and statewide:</p>
      <p>For Governor, Republican: Locally, Casey Cagle received 46.28 percent of the vote, Hunter Hill 11.08 percent, Brian Kemp 25.08 percent, Clay Tippins 9.12 percent and Michael Williams 8.45 percent.</p>
      <p>In order to win a nomination, a candidate must receive a majority of the vote, meaning 50 percent plus one. If no candidate receives this majority, the top two vote earners square off in a runoff election. </p>
      <p>Statewide, Cagle received the most votes with 39.01 percent of the vote, and Kemp came in second with 25.55 percent. </p>
      <p>As the top two vote earners in their race, Cagle and Kemp will face one another in a July 24 Special Election Runoff to see who will emerge as the Republican nominee ahead of the Nov. 6 General Election.</p>
