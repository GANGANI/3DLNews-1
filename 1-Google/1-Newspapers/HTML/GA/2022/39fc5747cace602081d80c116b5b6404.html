		<div id="article_header">Welcome to the Pike County Times.com Board of Commissioners Page.</div>
		<br />
		<p>This is my way of providing accountability in County Government. Shedding light on our county government is very important. Public scrutiny will encourage questions from the public as to why our representatives act on our behalf. Public scrutiny will also encourage a dialogue between our county government and its citizens. </p>
		<p>I believe that citizens have every right to provide our opinions to our representatives, and I believe that we are obligated to bring information to our representatives so they can make an educated decision on our behalf. I also believe that citizens have an obligation to ask questions of our government representatives in order to ensure that our representatives are acting in our best interest. </p>
		<p>Citizens and county government should work hand in hand to keep Pike County a great place to live.</p>

There are minutes from every county board and authority that spends Pike County funding included with the minutes for meetings as well. I like open government!

</p>

<p><Font color="#0000cc">[Note from the Editor on 2.22.24: Backstory - Pike County Times has requested to be on the agenda during public comment with the topic of "The County Manager's Performance and His Secret Evaluation." The rest of the story - Apparently Pike County is having a problem with Novus Agenda, which is the platform that uploads the agendas, minutes, etc. and the agenda for Tuesday night's meeting is incomplete even though it was showing on Novus Agenda this afternoon. I thought it was completed early and did not realize that there were issues with the platform when I uploaded it onto Pike County Times earlier today.
</p>

<p>
At the request of the county, I have deleted the link to the proposed agenda from my FB page and from Pike County Times. I will upload again tomorrow after affirming that the agenda is complete. *PLEASE NOTE: This was done on 2.23.24.*
</p>

<p>
I have requested to be placed on the agenda to speak on the record about the county manager's performance and the annual evaluation that he was given in an executive session and has not been spoken about in a public meeting to this point. 
</p>

<p>
I do not understand why this evaluation was conducted the way that it was or why it has not been brought up at a county meeting afterward so the public is aware of what has been done on our behalf. I have repeatedly urged county commissioners to act in a manner that is above reproach as I have attended meetings here in Pike County for more than 20 years. IMO This doesn't pass the smell test. 
</p>

<p>
Why is the county manager's annual evaluation being hidden behind closed doors when all of the other department heads and employee evaluations are available to the public through open records? He is the leader for our county, and leaders lead by example. He is (supposed to be) accountable to our commissioners, and our commissioners are accountable to the people who elected them. 
</p>

<p>
There is no accountability or integrity in an evaluation that is held behind closed doors and the results not even brought before the taxpayers of our county. It might as well not have happened.
For anyone who disagrees with the way that I am looking at this, feel free to contact me or send a letter to the editor. I will be happy to upload it exactly as it is sent to me.]</font>

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - It started with a dream to help build an animal shelter that would help cats and dogs here in Pike County. Ruth Chandler and the Chandler Family provided $225,000 through the CLC Foundation Inc. to provide the building that was intended to be used as a fully-functioning, county-wide animal shelter. The shelter was built and established in 2021, but it never received the funding that is necessary to open and run the animal shelter.

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - After meeting in Executive Session for an hour, the Board of Commissioners exited and voted on two items that had been discussed behind closed doors.
</p>

<p>The first was acquisition of real estate. Commissioners voted unanimously to move forward with the purchase of approximately 238 acres in Zebulon for the amount of 3 million dollars.
</p>

<p>Pike County Times asked after the meeting, âThree million dollars. Where is it coming from and what is it for?â County Attorney Rob Morton advised, âIt is for future growth and the financing component is being researched.â
</p>

<p><font color="#0000cc">[Note from the Editor: Morton advised that this is the old King Farm between Hwy 18 and County Farm Road behind the City Sewer Pond and the Bus Barn. This is for parcel numbers 067008, 66005, and 06605ZZ if anyone wants to look it up.]</font>
</p>

<p>
Commissioners also identified and unanimously voted for proposed members to serve on the Appeals Committee to hear a grievance in the county. Teri Totten, Rufus Clemmons, and Rob Weaver were named for the 3 person committee with Michael Smith and Keith Ford being named as alternatives if necessary.
</p>

<p><Font color="#0000cc">[Note from the Editor: The employee and person that the grievance was placed against was not said on the record in the meeting. However, Pike County Times has obtained documentation through open records and is able to say that this is the grievance placed against County Manager Brandon Rogers by Pike County Department Head and Library Manager Rosemary Bunn of the J. Joel Edwards Library. (Pike County Times is not covering the information obtained through open records regarding the incidents that led up to this grievance being filed other than what has been previously reported in order to ensure that Appeals Board hears the information for the first time as it is presented to them in this hearing.) Library Board Chairman Anthony Vinson spoke in the Town Hall Session prior to the beginning the Commission meeting and did not mention the grievance specifically. However, he did say, "We (members of the Library Board) are committed to supporting our library manager who we also believe to be under attack by the county manager." He handed out "Save Our Library" buttons to library supporters that went along with his plea for the commissioners to help save the library from the overreach of County Manager Brandon Rogers who Vinson said does not value the library. Pike County Times will be including his comments verbatim along with the write up of today's meeting.]</font>

<p>ZEBULON - The Zebulon City Council held a Special Called Meeting on Wednesday, December 28, 2022 with the only item on the agenda being an Executive Session regarding personnel. When they came back into session, there was a 3-1 vote with Council Member Dewey Yarbrough opposed to put the Assistant Chief of Police on salary. Overtime that is planned into the budget will be used to pay for this. Discussion that some budget line items may need to be tweaked. It was also mentioned that state law has been passed regarding food trucks. This will have to be reviewed before the upcoming January 10 meeting. 
</p>

<p><font color="#0000cc">[Note from the Editor: It sounds like the Chief of Police wanted to make his Assistant Chief hourly instead of salaried. Council Member Yarbrough explained his no vote after the meeting to Pike County Times by saying that the Chief was put in place to be the head of the Police Department, and they (as in the City Council) "can't micromanage the police."]</font>

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - On Wednesday, the Pike County Board of Commissioners imposed a 90-day moratorium on all new major and minor subdivisions and any building permits related thereto in a 5-0 decision. Pike County Times will have more on this when the write up on the meeting is completed.
</p>

<p><font color="#0000cc">[Note from the Editor: I asked for a clarification to be sure that I have things down correctly. Planning and Development Director Jeremy Gilbert said this: âThe moratorium is for new submittals of minor and major subdivision plats and the building permits for new subdivision plats that have not already been approved. If a plat has already been approved then a building permit can still be issued. However, if a plat is in the process now they can continue with the approval process but would not be able to pull building permits until the moratorium is lifted. We are still accepting rezoning, special exception and variance applications as normal. Any existing residential rezoning application that we have will still be heard for the zoning but they will not be able to submit the preliminary or final plat until after the moratorium ends. Currently the moratorium is set for 90 days or until the impact fees are evaluated and any changes are approved by the BOC.â]</font>

<p><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">UPDATED 7.23.22: Rumors are rampant that a halfway house for a substance abuse treatment is coming to Pike County based on the advertisement for the annexation of the VA clinic from Pike County into the City of Zebulon. Pike County Times spoke to the City of Zebulon and was advised that because the VA Clinic will be offering substance abuse treatment at the facility, there is specific language from OCGA 36-66-4(f) that is required to be in the public hearing announcement as follows: "...both the posted notice and the published notice shall include a prominent statement that the proposed zoning decision relates to or will allow the location of a halfway house, drug rehabilitation cetner, or other facility for treatment of drug dependency..." The City of Zebulon advised as follows: "The VA facility is not considered to be a halfway house as it does not have the capacity to house patients overnight for any type of treatment."</font>

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - Pike County Times has walked through the hiring of many county managers over the years. Some employments have gone smoothly, and some have not. Pike County has a reputation as a bit of a revolving door of late with the exception of John Hanson staying for six years with Bobby Bickley staying six months before resigning and Ron Alexander resigning after only five months on the job. There was no exposÃ© after Bobby Bickley left; it just wasnât a good fit for him as county manager. But there were rumors of problems while Ron Alexander was here as county manager.

<p>ZEBULON - Chief Appraiser Greg Hobbs spoke before commissioners in the April 28, 2020 meeting about the tax assessment that was coming for property owners in Pike County. Scroll down to his notes and then click on the letter that Appraiser Hobbs sent to Pike County Times at my request after that meeting. Tax Commissioner Donna Chapman spoke at the budget meeting tonight and advised that the county is looking at a 12.243 rollback, but the impact of this year's budget is going to be on the homeowner. There hasnât been a reevaluation in 10 to 15 years when itâs supposed to be done every 3-5 years. Commercial will be done next year, but this year the homeowners will be hurting this year. The deadline for appeals in July 17.
</p>

<p>Chief Appraiser Greg Hobbs walked through the process tonight. For people who say overnight my home value went up $100,000, he said that some of them did because they needed to. He asked residents to look at the value and see if that is correct. If there is a problem with the value, let them know. And the value came from surrounding properties in your neighborhood. The tax number hasnât been set up for the county yet. He asked that residents come to the office and sit down to discuss things if they have questions. The number to the office is 770-567-2002.

<br />


<p>ZEBULON - Grady notified Pike County on March 22, 2019 that it would be unable to continue under the current agreement and gave Pike County a sixty (60) day notice as required prior to the renewal term of July 1, 2019. The Pike County Commission did not agree to any of the terms that Grady proposed in the letter (details in the article below) at a recent commission meeting, but Pike County agreed to meet with Grady and see if negotiations would find common ground. Pike County Times has learned that the Pike County Commissioners and Grady/South Georgia Ambulance have come to an agreement on the contract.

If Grady chooses to sever the contract, it had to be done today because there is a 60 day clause that says, "Either party may terminate this Agreement by notifying the other party in writing not less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term." I've already put in an open records request for this information, and my breaking news subscribers will know it first.

<br />


<p>ZEBULON - HB 734 is entitled the "Ethics in Journalism Act" and is supposed to create journalism ethics board that will govern media entities throughout the state of Georgia. This letter basically walks through my reasons that the legislation is bad and encourages any who are already signed onto this legislation to walk away from it. This legislation is in clear violation of not one but two constitutions, and it deserves a very loud rebuke in the public square.
