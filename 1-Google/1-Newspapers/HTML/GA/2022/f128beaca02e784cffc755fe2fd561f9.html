County Attorney Rob Morton advised that he is on leave until Thanksgiving. Pike County Times asked if there was a reason for him being on leave or anything in writing and was advised that there is not a document that is open to public disclosure on this matter. âHe is entitled to leave under our policies and he is taking his leave,â said Morton.]</font>
