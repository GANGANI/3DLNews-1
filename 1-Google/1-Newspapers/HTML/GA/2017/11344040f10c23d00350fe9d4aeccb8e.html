The collision happened near mile marker 221, or just past Jodeco Road and before Jonesboro Road, at around 4:40 a.m., according to the Georgia Department of Transportation. The lanes were cleared by 11:20 a.m., GDOT stated, though traffic remained backed up for miles. Henry police confirmed at least one fatality. They did not release additional information about the extent of any other injuries. After the crash, a crane was used to lift a vehicle that appeared to have been pinned under one of the tractor-trailers. Several other big rigs remained on the shoulder of the interstate during the cleanup efforts. Police did not share details about what led to the wreck, as investigators processed the scene. Motorists were told to avoid the area. Backups extended for several miles, reaching I-675 as of 11:30 a.m. Commuters used U.S. 19/41, Ga. 42 and Ga. 155 as alternates, though traffic on those roads moved slowly, according to the WSB 24-hour Traffic Center.
