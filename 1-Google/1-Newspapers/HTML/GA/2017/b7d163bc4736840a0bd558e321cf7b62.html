<p>ZEBULON - There was a two vehicle accident on Highway 19 in front of the J. Joel Edwards Library this morning before 7 a.m. this morning. Two people died as a result of this wreck and two were life-flighted to Grady Hospital in Atlanta.
</p>

<p><Font color="#0000cc">Update 10:30 a.m.</font>
</p>

<p>Pike County Sheriff's Deputies responded to an early morning vehicle collision on Highway 19 in the area of Pirate Drive at 6:33 a.m. today. A 2006 Ford F-150 was travelling northbound on Highway 19 and crossed into the southbound lane striking a Chevrolet Traverse in a head on manner. 
</p>

<p>The driver and one occupant of the Chevrolet Traverse were deceased at the scene, a third passenger was extricated by the Pike County Fire Department and transported by life flight to Grady Hospital. 
</p>

<p>The driver of the F-150, Austin Greene, 21 years of age from Thomaston, Georgia, was helped out of his vehicle by a citizen as the vehicle caught fire. Mr. Greene was also airlifted to Grady Hospital with injuries. 
</p>

<p>Sheriff's Office Traffic Investigators are working to re-create the events leading up to this terrible tragedy, toxicology submissions are being made to the GBI crime lab for analysis. Any criminal charges are pending the outcome of the investigation. 
</p>

<p>The names of the deceased are not being released until family can be notified out of state.
</p>

<p><Font color="#0000cc">UPDATE 3.13.17</font>
</p>

<p>Zoom 101.1 out of Thomaston reported last week that the two people killed in this wreck were consultants for Upson Regional Medical Center (URMC). According to this report, URMC issued a memo to employees that advised of the deaths of Kim Lee and Jim Wisneiwski and asked for prayer for their families as well as for surviving passenger Greg Rouleau who was taken by life flight to Grady. Lee and Wisneiwski had been working with staff at the hospital for some time on a major I.T. upgrade project for URMC. 
</p>

<p>According to the accident report obtained by Pike County Times and information obtained from the Pike County Sheriff's Office, Kimberly Lee, 55 years of age was from Lafayette, Louisiana and James Wisniewski, 56 years of age, was from Allen, Texas. Greg Rouleau is from Taragold Gree, Arkansas.
</p>

<p>The accident report also reports that the driver of the Ford F-150 stated that he was traveling north on Highway 19 and that he looked down at something and doesn't remember anything else. 
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Major David Neal advised that this accident is still under investigation.
