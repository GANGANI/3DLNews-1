</a>. She has said in interviews and in her latest book that salary is not her only factor in determining her next career move.

<strong>Paul Levinson</strong>

"As the age of great farces ends and authenticity is in demand, she can become the identity of NBC News in terms of prime-time specials and breaking news if the network is sharp enough to recognize that she has the capacity to do that and not put her in infotainment hell evident in the network's 'Dateline'-type programming."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="22">Broadcast networks have been losing clout over the past couple of decades so stepping away from 2016's No. 1 cable network is a risk for Kelly.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="23"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericschiffer">
<strong>Eric Schiffer</strong>,</a> chairman/CEO of Patriarch Group, a leading private equity firm in technology and media, said this move gives Kelly new creative opportunities. But he said she could potentially bomb given her Fox affiliation and her confrontation with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> during and after the debates in 2015: "She's been branded a Republican and liberals may cringe when they see her irrespective of what her politics could be. And strong Trump supporters wanted to put her head on a stick over the past six to nine months."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="24"><a href="http://grady.uga.edu/directory/small/castengera">
<strong>Michael Castengera</strong>
</a>, a University of Georgia journalism teacher and consultant to broadcast news stations, said Kelly will certainly gain curious eyeballs early on but she'll have to earn viewers long term. And he posed this existential question: "Does the news content matter or is it a matter of who presents it?"</p><div class="c-section"><div class="story-interscroller__placeholder full-width c-clear-both c-contentElements"></div></div><p class="story-text " data-index="26">Castengenra doesn't think her departure will hurt Fox News. "Quite frankly, Fox News has carved out a very strong niche. Its hardcore fans will watch it and love it. Megyn's name isn't as big as the Fox News name. An analogy is a football team that loses a star player. If you've got good backups, you should be fine. Fox has a lot of good backups."</p></div></div></div></span><span data-pagezone="post-article-body"><div class="c-section full-width b-clear-both"></div><div class="c-section full-width b-clear-both"><div class="c-blogAuthor b-margin-bottom-30 "><p class="blogAuthor-title">About the Author</p><div class="blog-author-content"><div class="b-flexRow blog-author-content-heading has-image"><a href="/staff/rodney-ho/" rel="author"><div class="content-profileImage"><div class="c-image-component    image-landscape"><div class="image-component-image "><div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"><div class="lazyload-wrapper"><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/gAJDZKrMeT0We4ehS94u5HeKklg=/100x100/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/3701b49c-0a45-4a95-a5c8-7d7a96ec061f.png" alt="ajc.com" width="100" height="100" class=" " style="display:none" fetchpriority="auto"/><div class="c-loadingSpinner"></div></div><p class="photo-credit-text"></p></div></div></div></div></a><div class="content-authorName"><a href="/staff/rodney-ho/" rel="author">Rodney Ho</a><div class="content-authorSocial"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv"><img src="/pf/resources/images/facebook-burger.svg?d=1474" alt="Follow Rodney Ho on facebook" width="17" height="17"/></a><a href="https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho"><img src="/pf/resources/images/twitter-burger.svg?d=1474" alt="Follow Rodney Ho on twitter" width="17" height="17"/></a></div></div></div><div class="b-flexRow"><p class="content-authorDescription">Rodney Ho writes about entertainment for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution including TV, radio, film, comedy and all things in between.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"One year under new ownership, Tara still losing money but in better shape"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-30T16:56:28.756Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"BRIEFS: Ronnie DeVoe, Al Roker talk Boys & Girls Club; Frank Ski’s baby"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-29T18:42:57.344Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Who won ‘American Idol’ season 22?"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-20T03:25:12.453Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Caroline Jones lauds mentor Jimmy Buffett, juggles Zac Brown Band, solo work"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-17T18:50:15.935Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Amazon touts ‘The Idea of You’ as a big hit for the streamer"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-17T12:25:35.184Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Ralph From Ben Hill, former WGST radio host, dies at 74"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-17T11:37:41.753Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/news","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"News","description":"Atlanta Georgia News main page: Breaking News, Atlanta Weather Forecast, Crime, Politics, GA Schools, Local Articles -

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Did Atlanta’s Rod and Leticia Gardner win ‘The Amazing Race’?"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-16T10:59:44.794Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Can Georgia couple Rod and Leticia Gardner win ‘The Amazing Race’?

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"CNN

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Massive shakeup in cast of ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ for season 16"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-15T13:32:11.8Z","taxonomy":{"primary_site":{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"type":"site","version":"0.5.8"},"sections":[{"path":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","parent":{"default":"/things-to-do"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/things-to-do","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","description":null,"_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"default":"/things-to-do","MainMenu2024":"/things-to-do","ComposerNav":"/things-to-do","subnav_things_to_do":"/"},"site":{"site_url":null,"site_keywords":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":null,"site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","site_tagline":null},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","cohort_desktop_image":null,"cohort":"false","cohort_mobile_image":null},"_admin":{"alias_ids":["/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene","_id":"/things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","ancestors":{"default":["/things-to-do"],"MainMenu2024":["/","/things-to-do"],"ComposerNav":["/things-to-do"],"subnav_things_to_do":["/"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2003,"ComposerNav":2005,"subnav_things_to_do":1003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./things-to-do/georgia-entertainment-scene","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.
