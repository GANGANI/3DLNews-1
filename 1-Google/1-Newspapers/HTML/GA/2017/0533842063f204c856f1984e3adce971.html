<p>ZEBULON - 	The Pike County Middle School cross country traveled to Americus to compete in its first meet of the season the Furlow Fast Feet Invitational.  Both teams crushed their opponents individually and team efforts.  
</p>

<p>	The girls took to the line first with nine other teams and 70 runners total. When the race started, they never looked back.  Lauren Smith was the first runner across the line beating the second place finisher by twenty-seven seconds.  The girls had 5 of their runners finish in the top ten including Catherine Stuart fourth place, Lexi Reeves seventh, Aisley Sampler ninth and Mary Elliot tenth.  Also finishing strong for Pike were Addison Stuart, Emma Truitt, Mackenzie Malcolm and Jamie Wallace.
</p>

<p>	The girls finished the race with a team score of 18 (15 would be a perfect score).  The second place team managed 59 points.
</p>

<p>	The boys faired just as well.  With 105 runners totaling ten teams, the traffic on the two mile course was a bit more crowed.  That did not phase the Pike runners.  The positioned themselves well and finished strong.  The Pirate boys also finish with five runners in the top ten led by overall winner Aiden Potter followed by Garret Child third, Landon Clark fourth, Andrew Edwards eighth and Christian Fowler ninth.  Also pushing the pace for the Pike were Luke Woerner, Cooper Hanson, Noah Strader, Jonny Collins and Brayden Keiser.
</p>

<p>	The boys finished with 25 points outdistancing the second place team by 31 points.  All runners finishing in the top ten earned medals for their efforts.  
</p>

<p>	It was a strong showing for early in the season.  The team will continue to train in hopes of defending their league titles.  The team will be hosting a home meet on September 12th at the middle school.
