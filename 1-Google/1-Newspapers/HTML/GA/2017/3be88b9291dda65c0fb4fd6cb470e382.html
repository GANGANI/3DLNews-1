Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.
