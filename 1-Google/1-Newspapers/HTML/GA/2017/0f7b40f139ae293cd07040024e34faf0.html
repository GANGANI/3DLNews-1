<br />


<p>ZEBULON -The Zebulon Police Department made several arrests on Saturday, March 18. Two were charged with possession of methamphetamine in Zebulon, and two others were arrested after a high speed chase that ended in Fayette County.
</p>

<p>A traffic stop in Zebulon led to the arrest of Charles Jones, 23 years of age from Pike County, and Nick Fitzgibbon, 38 years of age from Clayton County. Both were charged with possession of methamphetamine. 
</p>

<p>
An attempted traffic stop later that day led to a high speed chase that began with the suspects in a white Ford Expedition speeding through the Freshway parking lot onto Highway 19 toward the Atlanta Motor Speedway before turning back south and traveling down Highway 92 in Griffin. The chase ended just inside of the Fayette County line.
</p>

<p>
John Leatherwood, 37 years of age from Spalding County, was the driver of the vehicle. The passenger, Andrea Cobb, 40 years of age from Spalding County, was an active participant in the crime as she was dumping methamphetamine out bags onto the highway in an attempt to get rid of the evidence.
</p>

<p>
The Georgia State Patrol assisted in the chase and attempted to perform a pit maneuver as the vehicle was approaching the Fayette County line. The driver saw the vehicle getting into position to pit his vehicle and overcorrected with his own vehicle, hitting a telephone pole and crashing into a tree in the woods where the vehicle finally came to a stop. 
</p>

<p>
Leatherwood was charged with fleeing or attempting to elude officers, and Cobb was charged with obstruction. Both were charged with possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute.
</p>

<p>Major Jason Smith advised that numerous other traffic offenses are pending since the chase reached speeds of over 100 miles per hour and Leatherwood was traveling south in the northbound lane of Highway 19-41 at one point during the chase. Both were transported to the hospital after the wreck.
</p>

<p>
PFC Trustin Brazer and Officer Anthony Thompson from Zebulon Police Department were an integral part of these arrests.
</p>

<p>
Zebulon Police Department would like to thank to the Georgia State Patrol, and deputies from the Spalding, Pike, and Fayette Sheriffâs Offices for their assistance in the arrests of these suspects. More photos are below the article.
