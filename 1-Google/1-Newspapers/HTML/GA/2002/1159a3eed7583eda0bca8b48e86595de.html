      her scary Peter's Road story </font></b></font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was 14 years old when my 
        family and I moved to Fayette County. Of course everybody thinks that 
        I am pulling their leg whenever I mentioned the &quot;Peter's Road&quot; 
        story. I was so glad to see that after years of sharing my story about 
        the things my friends and I had seen on Peter's Road that someone else 
        acknowledged strange happenings on Peter's Road. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My brother Joe, who now resides 
        in Melbourne, Fla., was just here last weekend for a visit and sat around 
        a campfire roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories to my three 
        kids. Of course he had to tell the &quot;Peter's Woods&quot; story, which 
        is what we called it instead of Peter's Road. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joe told my kids that the story 
        he told them was very true. I think it kind of scared my two youngest 
        kids, Kaylee and Cody. But my oldest daughter Mandy, my stepmom Gail and 
        my father Dee laughed about it with a big, &quot;Yeah, right, that's what 
        they all say after a good ghost story.&quot; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you, Mr. Lexington, for 
        sharing your story about Peter's Road. Now my dad and stepmom want to 
        visit Peter's Woods. My oldest daughter Mandy is still skeptical about 
        it, but now is curious since she read your article. My side of the story 
        is somewhat different, but as far as the cemetery goes, I have been there 
        myself and seen it. So to all you readers, buckle down and enjoy my story. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About a year after we had moved 
        to Fayette County, some friends of ours told us a little about some creepy 
        things that they had heard about Peter's Road and wanted to know if we 
        wanted to go and visit there. I was a little scared but I went. It was 
        on a rainy day. There was a car-sized trail leading back into the woods 
        off of Peter's Road. It was so creepy, even though it was daylight. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We drove some distance into 
        the woods until we finally saw some things hanging from a tree limb. We 
        stopped the car and got out to observe what we had spotted with our eyes. 
        Which it turned out to be [were] old, tattered woman's underwear. We got 
        close enough to them to see dark smudge prints on them that we thought 
        was blood. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was really getting antsy 
        and wanted to turn back. The others were laughing and said, &quot;Somebody 
        is probably living back here.&quot; Then on another tree we saw other 
        objects hanging from it that we never could figure out what they were. 
        Then we saw a part of an old shredded rope on the ground and above it 
        on a limb was the other part. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the group that we were 
        with wanted to keep following the trail. And so we did. And came upon 
        some headstones on which the writing was illegible. Some of them were 
        broken off on the corners. I was really scared then, and I said, &quot;Let's 
        go back to the car and get out of here.&quot; I think the others were 
        scared too. I know my sister Cindy was because she agreed with me. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we were all running back 
        to the car, it started to really pour down rain, along with thunder and 
        lightning. Everybody at once heard the strangest sound that sounded like 
        someone screaming from far away. My brother Joe said, &quot;It's just 
        a wildcat.&quot; But nobody believed him. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We got into the car and locked 
        the doors, and headed back off the trail. But midway back to the road 
        we got stuck. All I could think about is all of the horror movies I have 
        seen this very same thing happen in. Everybody's adrenaline was pumping 
        so hard that nobody wanted to get out of the car to get it unstuck, except 
        for good ol' brother Joe. I thought that we would never get out of there, 
        but thank God we did. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of weeks later I and 
        some of my friends, along with my brother Joe, again were headed to a 
        party and had to turn down that road. This time it was extremely dark 
        outside. We came across the one and only bridge on that road and someone 
        yelled, &quot;Stop, go back. Did y'all see that?&quot; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we put the truck in reverse 
        and backed up on the bridge. Everybody looked to the right and saw this 
        big weird-shaped thing that looked like a deformed head with green eyes. 
        We all freaked out and left there quick. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After that night we were told 
        that what we had seen were water heads that live under that bridge. Whatever 
        those are. But one thing is for sure, I haven't been back down that road 
        at night time since that night about 20 years ago, and I don't make a 
        habit to go down it during the day, especially if it is raining. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know it sounds a little farfetched, 
        but we were told that a man named &quot;Peter&quot; killed himself in 
        those woods and it has been haunted ever since. It made a true believer 
        out of me, that is for sure. I will never be brave enough to go back into 
        those woods again. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope that you enjoyed my 
        story. If you want to try and visit there, all I can say is, good luck! 
        If anybody else has other information about Peter's Road or Peter's Woods, 
        please share it with me. </font>
