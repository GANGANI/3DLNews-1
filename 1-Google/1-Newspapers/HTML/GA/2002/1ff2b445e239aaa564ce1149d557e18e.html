It can take longer ... even longer             than snail mail. My cousin Randall Smith just received a response             to a message regarding the Norris Candy Company in Atlanta that he             left on Genforum nearly two years ago. Now that's slow! </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I, myself,             have put queries on the boards about this Norris family since Sarah             Ann Norris was my GGgrandmother. And this same Norris family was right             here in Fayette County more than 100 years ago. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The family's             connection to the Norris Candy Company is well known by all relatives.             Said to have been started by Sarah's brother, Joel C. Norris (since             disproved), it was a huge success in the Atlanta area and lasted nearly             60 years. But, the actual initiator of the company was Arthur Leland             &quot;Buddy&quot; Norris. Research done by Randall years ago shows             records stating that Arthur, not Joel, started the company in 1905.             However, Joel was Arthur's father, and the seed may have been planted             there. Joel was a cobbler (shoe maker), according to census and other             records. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The roots             of this family remain a mystery to us, since all family files at the             Georgia Archives have been pulled from public view. There is supposed             to be a file there on John &quot;Jethro&quot; Norris, who is the earliest             ancestor we've been able to find. He was Joel and Sarah's father and             Arthur's grandfather. But when I went there and asked to see it, I             was given the bad news that the Georgia Legislature had mandated that             all personal &quot;family&quot; files, those left in loose papers             by individuals, be kept from public view. I certainly hope they weren't             destroyed! </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From other             records, we have been able to piece together some information on this             Norris family. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John &quot;Jethro&quot;             Norris was born in South Carolina about 1807. He married Mary (maiden             name said to be Johnson) about 1826 and lived in Gwinnett County in             1850 with his large family. Their children were Sarah Ann (b. 1828),             James C.H. (b. abt 1831), Joel C. (b. abt 1832), William J. (b. abt             1836), Lucy Ann (b. abt 1838 ... although her grave says 1833), Temperance             (b. abt 1839), John (b. abt 1841), Lucinda Matilda (b. 1843), Henry             T. (b. abt 1845), Lindsey M. (b. abt 1847), Reuben J. (b. abt 1849)             and Mary Catherine (b. 1854). </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometime             before 1860, John and his family moved to Fayette County and are said             to have lived in the Fife community, near where Bethany Methodist             Church is today. John Norris' grandson, John Fowler, and his wife,             Nancy Leah Harper Fowler, are both buried at Bethany. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometime             before 1870, John moved to the Campbellton District of Campbell County,             which was out near the Chattahoochee River. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is             where I first found one-year-old Arthur, living with his parents,             John (Joel) and Amelia (King) Norris. Arthur's grandparents, Jethro             and Mary Norris, lived next door. The Norris children had married             along the way and left home, and I had quite a bit of information             on them: Sarah Ann married John Fowler in 1847 in Gwinnett Co.; Joel             C. married Amelia King in 1866 in Fayette Co.; Lucy Ann married Zephaniah             Fowler in 1853 in Gwinnett Co.; Lucinda Matilda (who was still at             home in 1870) married Solomon Cochran in 1871 (thought to be in Coweta             Co.); and Mary Catherine (who also was still at home in 1870) married             William Christopher White about 1875, probably in Campbell Co. What             happened to the others is unknown at this time. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I found             each piece of information, I sent copies of it to Randall and all             the other Fowler/Norris researchers, since we were all having such             a hard time finding records of this family. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two days             ago, I received an e-mail from Randall with the subject line of, &quot;You're             not gonna believe this!&quot; In the e-mail was a forwarded message             from Spruill Harder in Brookline, Mass., whose mother was the stepdaughter             of Arthur &quot;Buddy&quot; Norris of Norris Candy Company fame. Spruill's             grandmother was Ora Cordelia Green Fincher, who married Buddy (as             his second wife) about 1939. Buddy was an old man of 70 by this time             and Ora Cordelia was about 20 years his junior. The marriage lasted             only two years before Buddy died in 1941. But Spruill's mother had             told him about the Norrises and she remembered Buddy's children (by             his first wife) with &quot;great fondness.&quot; They included a son             (whose name she cannot recall) and two daughters, Marie, who married             a Mr. Letts, and Martha, who married a Mr. Ahearn. Marie Norris Letts             had two sons, one who was said to be in the real estate business in             Sandy Springs as late as 1969. Martha Norris Ahearn had a son named             Jimmy. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story             of the beginning of the candy business, as told by Spruill's mother,             was that Buddy sold his mother's candy door to door in the neighborhood             when he was a child, and learned to make candy from her. Buddy's company             was in the Norris Building on Peachtree St. about a half block from             Davison's Department Store. Nunnally Candy company was said to have             been their biggest competitor. Later, Buddy is said to have sold half             the business to the Lowenstein family, who eventually purchased all             the shares Buddy left to his children and stepchildren at his death.             </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you             want to hear something weird? Now that I know where it was, I can             remember going there as a child. They had all kinds of chocolate goodies             in the window and the place smelled delightful. I had no idea the             owners were my relatives. Maybe someone told me but I was too young             to remember. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks             to Ancestry's online Atlanta City Directory, I found Arthur living             with his father on Mechanic Street in Atlanta in 1889 and 1890. Arthur             was working for the Goldsmith Candy Company as a &quot;candy marker,&quot;             so it would appear that he learned more about the business before             he launched his own. The Norris company wasn't started until 1905.             </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is             much more to this story but I'll have to save it for another column.             If you remember the Norris Candy Company in Atlanta, or anything about             the Norris family, I'd love to hear from you. </font>          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got a tale             about your Georgia ancestors?
