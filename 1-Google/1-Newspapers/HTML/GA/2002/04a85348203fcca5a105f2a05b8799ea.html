      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thomas E. Farr, 
        60 &#173; honored leader in the Fayette County business community, executive 
        vice-president and chief operating officer of Peachtree National Bank, 
        elder at First Presbyterian Church in Peachtree City, Rotarian &#173; 
        died at his home Wednesday, apparently of natural causes. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peachtree City 
        Public Information Officer Betsy Tyler said flags on city property have 
        been lowered to half-staff and will remain that way until sunset Saturday. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He's 
        been an outstanding citizen in our city for years. He served 17 years 
        on the Development Authority,&quot; Tyler said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The funeral 
        service will be 11 a.m. Saturday, July 13, at the First Presbyterian Church 
        of Peachtree City. Complete arrangements and survivors follow in this 
        story. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Farr and his 
        father, W.F. Farr, better known as Floy, represent generations of movers 
        and shakers in the Fayette community. The family, planted in Georgia by 
        James Oglethorpe, shows up on the oldest Fayette tax records and in the 
        Army of the Confederacy. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a 2000 interview, 
        Floy Farr said his son Tom was born &quot;in the back of the doctor's 
        office in Fayetteville.&quot; He was raised in Tyrone where the elder 
        Farr, a banker, virtually presided over the business community and helped 
        fund the establishment of Peachtree City. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tom Farr graduated 
        from Fayette County High School and from the University of Georgia. He 
        earned his master's degree at Georgia State. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Executive vice 
        president and chief operating officer of Peachtree National Bank, Farr 
        was well-known for his work on local authorities. He was past-chair of 
        the Peachtree City Development Authority and chair of the Fayette Community 
        Hospital Authority, and past vice-chair of Fayette County's Development 
        Authority. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He also served 
        the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce as treasurer and was elected the 
        chamber's Fayette County Business Person of 1994. He was a graduate of 
        the Regional Leadership Institute. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fellow employees 
        of Peachtree National honored him with the designation of Employee of 
        the Year for 2001. He was with the bank since September, 1994, and was 
        on its board of directors when he died. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bank president 
        Ronald Duffey described him as a godsend who did all the analyzing of 
        the numbers and oversaw financial information in the running of the bank, 
        but was so much more. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He was 
        the single most honest and dependable person I've ever known,&quot; Duffey 
        said. &quot;We were a team; we thought so much alike. I'll never, never 
        be able to replace him. He's the only person I've ever let speak for me. 
        I never once second-guessed anything he did.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Farr's close 
        friend and colleague, Fayette Realtor Jim Fulton, said Farr was &quot;the 
        last guy to want recognition ... When Tom took over [leadership of] the 
        development authority, we built and ran the [Frederick Brown, Jr.] amphitheater 
        and the tennis center. Everything he did was from the heart and for the 
        good of the community and not for public recognition. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He's 
        the perfect example of the servant-leader,&quot; Fulton continued. &quot;Just 
        say that he was a great friend, and many of the businesses of Peachtree 
        City owe their existence to him. If you stuck your head in his office 
        to say hello, you'd come out an hour later &#173; he never too busy to 
        talk to you.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Farr is survived 
        by his wife, Wendy Y. Farr, and children, Matthew Wood and Whitley Wood, 
        and his parents, Floy and Bruce Farr, all of Peachtree City; and his brother 
        and sister-in-law, Sonny and Pat Farr, of Santa Fe, N.M. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The funeral 
        will be tomorrow (Saturday) at 11 a.m. at his church on Willowbend Road 
        in Peachtree City. The Rev. Dr. Don Smith will lead the service, which 
        will include tributes by Joel Cowan, former Mayor Robert Lenox, and Sonny 
        Farr. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The body will 
        lie in state from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m. at the church. Visitation is this 
        evening (Friday), 6 to 8 p.m., at Mowell Funeral Home on Robinson Road 
        in Peachtree City, and interment will be at Westminster Memorial Gardens.
