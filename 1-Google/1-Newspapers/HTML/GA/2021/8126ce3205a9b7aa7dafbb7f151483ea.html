Humans are social beings. Our connection to others enables us to survive and thrive. People who engage in meaningful, productive activities with others tend to live longer, have a sense of purpose, and show better cognitive and immune function. As we age, many of us are alone more often than in our younger years, leaving us vulnerable to social isolation and loneliness, which may lead to health problems. 

Social isolation and loneliness are not entirely the same. Some people feel lonely despite being surrounded by family and friends. Social isolation is the objective physical separation from other people, while loneliness is the subjective distressed feeling of being alone or separated from others. It is possible to feel lonely while among other people, and you can be alone yet not feel lonely. 

Loneliness has been linked to altering the immune cells to promote inflammation. This reaction happens in the adrenocortical system, the same system that responds to stress. Loneliness acts as a fertilizer for other diseases. It has been found to accelerate the buildup of plaque in arteries, help cancer cells grow and spread, and promote inflammation in the brain, leading to Alzheimer’s disease. 

Research shows having a sense of mission and purpose in life is linked to healthier immune cells. The newest findings show even just a few close friends can help someone feel more connected and stay strong. Social ties may indirectly strengthen immunity as well. 

Friends, at least health-minded friends, can encourage good health behaviors such as eating, sleeping, and exercising well. Having some meaningful and positive relationships in your life will help you avoid loneliness and strengthen your immune system in the process. 

Over the past eight weeks, we have looked at how exercising, keeping a diet of whole foods that support your gut health, stress, and nervous system management, getting plenty of vitamin D, social interaction, and a good night’s rest, all positively affect your immune system. 

Your health is like a garden, it must be cultivated and cared for daily. If you neglect your garden, weeds of chronic disease and lowered immunity will eventually take over. No one else is to blame for an overgrown garden, but the gardener. Beware the promise of a quick fix. There is no miracle cure, magic bullet, shot, pill, potion, or lotion to create optimal health and immunity.
It’s all about being consistent with your healthy lifestyle choices. Tend to your garden daily.

A lot more!

This combination of bacterial, viral, and fungal cells makes up our microbiome. These cells live on our skin, in our nose, ears, lungs, urinary and reproductory canals and in the gut. A huge portion of the immune system is in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Nourishing this microbiome can help make the difference in you staying healthy.

As infants, we are born with immature immune systems. Most of the immune cells come from our mother’s immune system. The antibodies she produces while carrying the baby circulate through the same blood stream into the baby and get passed to the baby through breastfeeding after the baby is born. 

Infants that are born naturally, through the birth canal, have been shown to have a healthier biota (bacteria) in their nasal cavities and lungs than babies delivered by C-section. This happens because some of the mom’s microbiome gets on the baby in the birth canal, and the baby’s first breath inhales those cells to coat the inner layers of their nose, throat and lungs. In effect, these children have less risk of developing lung and throat infections compared to C-section babies. 

As we grow, it is imperative we feed these good biota into our system. Since there are over 39 trillion cells that make up our microbiome, we must diversify. There are different bacteria that help the lungs, versus the ones that help the colon function properly. It’s important you compare the bacteria in the probiotic you may be taking with the area of the body you may be struggling with. You may need different strain compared to what you’re taking. 

We can get biota through food as well as supplementing with a probiotic. Fermented foods have the highest concentration of probiotics if you don’t opt for an oral probiotic. Foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and pickles. Prebiotics have received a lot of hype recently. Prebiotics are what feed the gut bacteria. These are found in onions, garlic, asparagus, bananas, and beans. These also help balance the gut.

How do you know if your gut microbiome is in good shape? Take an honest look at how it functions. Normal bowel movements can range from three times a day to 3-4 times a week. Every good gut has an established pattern. It generally takes 24 to 72 hours for food to move completely through the GI tract. 

It should be easy to void your bowels, and if you are eating enough fiber (fruits and vegetables, not synthetic fiber) it should be a solid consistency, and therefore easy to wipe off. If you’re not voiding your bowels regularly, you could be holding onto food from days, or even weeks ago. Look into a good quality probiotic and try alternating them every couple months if it’s not working. This will help diversify the biota your gut needs.

Processed and sugary foods cause inflammation in the lining of your GI tract. The damage to the lining will make it harder for nutrients to get absorbed. When your gut doesn’t recognize something you ate, or has a sensitivity to it, the immune system gets stimulated to attack that material. Repeated attacks lead to a damaged lining and leaky gut, this increases your chances of developing an auto-immune disease. It has recently become obvious that alterations of the gut microbial communities can cause immune dysregulation, leading to autoimmune disorders. 

Autoimmune diseases cause the body to attack itself. There are many causes, but a common one lies in the gut. Foods that our bodies are sensitive to, such as processed foods can cause a negative reaction in the gut.  A comprehensive food panel test looking at your specific food sensitivities can be critical to not only help reverse the damage to the gut lining, but in turn increase your immunity and decrease chances of autoimmunity. 

We perform comprehensive blood tests identifying these foods. You can make huge changes in your immunity and gut health just by taking the invading foods out of your diet. Everyone’s food sensitivities are different, gluten and dairy are the most common ones, but sometimes it can be “healthy” things, such as eggs or pineapple. Figuring out what your body and GI system overreact to can help it not go into overdrive.

Food sensitivities should not be confused with food allergies. Food allergies cause an anaphylactic reaction. Food sensitivities result in a more delayed responses such as bloating, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, skin irritation and rashes, acne, congestion, and itching.

Antibiotics are something that alter your microbiome. They are used to reduce an invading infection in your body, but also destroy all the good bacteria that keep you healthy. It is critical to take a good, natural high dose probiotic after any round of antibiotics and then ensure you eat gut healthy foods. Eating yogurt after a round of antibiotics is not strong and concentrated enough to replace what the antibiotic takes out. You need at least 30-days of a probiotic.
 
Some research shows it may take a year and a half to restore balance in the gut after a round of antibiotics. Remember, this is where 70 percent of your immune system is! Sometimes, antibiotics are necessary but don’t ignore your gut health after taking them.

Vitamin D, while called a vitamin, is actually a hormone. It is required to absorb calcium in the body and positively impacts 36 bodily organs. Vitamin D is produced by the body in response to sunlight and absorbed through food. Unfortunately, due to modern life indoors, constant use of sunscreens, and a nutrient lacking diet, many people are deficient in Vitamin D. 

One of the many responsibilities Vitamin D has in the body is to regulate immunity. Researchers have found that Vitamin D not only affects key cells of the immune system but plays a critical role in regulating immune responses. Because of its influence on white blood cells, it modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, meaning it controls both natural and immunized immunity. 

Deficiency in Vitamin D is associated with an increased risk of developing an autoimmune condition, as well as an increased susceptibility to infection. Many studies have shown the impacts of supplementing Vitamin D to prevent acute respiratory tract infections. People who are overweight or obese add an additional stressor to the Vitamin D level. The more body fat a person has, the more Vitamin D is needed to increase the blood levels of Vitamin D in their body. 

Because it is critical to keep this level high for your immune system, Vitamin D is one of the blood tests you need to have tested regularly. Normal levels are between 30 – 100; the higher the better. After taking the proper recommended dose for your level, and mega-dosing if needed, your levels should come up. 

While we can get Vitamin D through supplementation and sunlight, 80% of how your body absorbs Vitamin D is due to genetics. You may be prone to deficiency and need to supplement Vitamin D your entire life. DNA testing can confirm or rule out a VDR gene variant, which is a genetic trait that determines how well you absorb Vitamin D. 

If you haven’t had bloodwork in a while, get it done now before the season changes and we get even less sun. Know your numbers so you can start changing them, if needed. Measure this core underlying cause of immune interference to create a healthier you. 

“External things (germs and viruses) never cause disease; they are merely agents waiting around to infect susceptible hosts. Rather than being at war against germs, we should worry more about strengthening our RESISTANCE to them.”-Andrew Weil, MD

Chiropractic directly influences the function of the immune system by reducing interference on the spinal nerves. 

Once the area of nerve interference is adjusted, the area controled by those nerves can see improvement. The nerves that control the immune system are located in the cervical and thoracic spine, or neck and upper back. These nerves branch out of the spine and control the sinus cavities, thymus, spleen, heart, and lungs. 

The ability of these organs to function correctly correlates with the amount of nerve pressure in that area of the spine. The nervous system has a direct influence on the immune system’s ability to work and respond as it was designed. 

One of the first links between the immune system and the nervous system was made in Russia, in the 1950s with Masha and Dasha. Masha and Dasha were conjoined twins that were taken at birth to be studied at a local institution. The girls were joined at the hips, so they shared all major organs and blood circulatory system. Together they had four arms, and two legs. The one distinct factor was that they had separate nervous systems. 

Each girl had individual brains and spinal columns. As the twins grew up, one of them was able to stand more straight up, while the other twin had to hang off to the side. After years of testing their responses to different stimuli; the scientists injected specific virus, and bacteria, all tested separately to determine how one girl’s body affected the other. The assumption that any bacteria or virus flowing through their blood stream would cause them both to be sick, proved not to be true. 

It was discovered that while one twin would get sick with the flu or measles, it wouldn’t always affect the other twin. They found that one of the girls (the girl with the straighter spine) had higher immunity than her sister. This groundbreaking discovery made scientists aware that the immune system is under direct control of the brain and spinal cord. 

And because the nervous system was the only difference in the girl’s anatomy, they concluded that the sister with the more balanced spine and nervous system had the stronger immune system. 

The state of your nervous system can determine whether you have high or low resistance to disease. If you are trying to prevent sickness and build immunity, you cannot deny the link between the brain, spinal cord, and immune system. Start taking care of your spine so your overall health and immune system will advance. 

Improving your health with a balanced nervous system can play a decisive role in whether or not you get sick, and if you do, how rapidly you recover.
