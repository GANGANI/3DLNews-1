His work at the newspaper over the past 12 years has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. In 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. In 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors & Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist. Edwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice. He was part of the team behind the AJC's Dangerous Dwellings series on persistently dangerous apartment complexes, winner of 2022 national awards from both Investigative Reporters & Editors and the National Headliners Awards.

Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport expects to handle 1.6 million passengers over the Labor Day travel period from Thursday through Tuesday, Sept. 6. The Atlanta airport said Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the travel period, with more than 300,000 passengers expected. Airport officials advise travelers to be in the airport terminal at least two hours before departure. The airport’s forecast indicates bigger crowds for Labor Day than last year, when travel was stymied by the spread of the delta variant of COVID-19 and the holiday period drew about 1.3 million passengers. Other busier holiday weekends have brought larger crowds this summer, including Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and other carriers have struggled to keep flights operating on time when weather disruptions threw schedules into disarray, causing flight cancellations and travel disruptions during some of the busiest periods. Delta said it has worked this summer to restore its operational reliability. The hassles of air travel have prompted some to decide to drive instead of fly, according to one survey. About 32% of those surveyed by AAA said they plan to travel for Labor Day weekend, and of those, 82% plan to drive.
