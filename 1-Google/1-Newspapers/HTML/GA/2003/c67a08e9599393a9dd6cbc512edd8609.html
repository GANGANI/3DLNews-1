      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coweta County school system 
        officials are still in shock this week after the stunning arrest of an 
        assistant superintendent last week. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assistant Superintendent of 
        Operations Chris Jennings was traveling Nov. 26 south on Interstate 85 
        near LaGrange in his grey Mercedes when a Georgia State Patrol officer 
        noticed him going 90 miles in a hour in a 70-mph zone, said patrol spokesman 
        Gordy Wright. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;The trooper noticed his 
        driving pattern, and when he stopped him, he also detected an aroma of 
        alcohol,&#148; Wright said. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the trooper asked him 
        for his driver&#146;s license, all Jennings could produce was his photo 
        ID from the Coweta County School System. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trooper conducted a field 
        sobriety test, and then patted Jennings down, where he discovered a vial 
        containing cocaine in his front pocket, Wright said. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A subsequent search of the 
        car also turned up another bottle of cocaine in Jennings&#146; shaving 
        kit in the trunk of his car. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jennings was taken to the Troup 
        County Jail and charged with felony possession of cocaine, DUI, obscured 
        tag, no driver&#146;s license, open container violation and speeding. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coweta County School Superintendent 
        Peggy Connell said she was made aware of the charges against Jennings 
        last Wednesday after the incident, and spoke to Jennings that evening. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Connell said she deeply 
        regrets the circumstances. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;He&#146;s worked for 
        this school system for almost 32 years, and his work has been wonderful,&#148; 
        Connell said. &#147;I was glad he was here. He&#146;s been a dedicated 
        and highly capable employee for over 30 years. We were all surprised.&#148; 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No decision has been made yet 
        on what course the school system will take regarding Jennings&#146; absence 
        from his post. </font>
