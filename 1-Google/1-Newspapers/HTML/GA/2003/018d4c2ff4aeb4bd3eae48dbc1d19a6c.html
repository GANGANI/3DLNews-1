<br />
<p>GRIFFIN - Georgia has been the poultry capital of the world for several decades now. Given that, it is no surprise that Pike County is enamored with everything related to backyard flocks. Keeping chickens, ducks, guineas, and other fowl may seem simple at first, but there is a definitely learning curve to successfully manage a productive backyard flock. From proper nutrition and breed choices to biosecurity and coop design, there is an overwhelming amount of resources out there which is why UGA Extension in Pike and Spalding Counties are partnering to offer a Backyard Poultry Workshop on May 14 in Griffin. 
</p>

<p>This workshop will present practical, hands-on sessions that participants can engage with and gain skills for implementing with their flocks. Learn the science behind egg candling for food safety, rearing mealworms for tasty treats, and even biosecurity measures to take to prevent disease issues. The registration fee of $25 covers all program materials and lunch. Register by May 13 with the Pike County Extension office at 770.567.2010 or Brooklyne.Wassel@uga.edu to reserve a seat in the class.

				<br /> 


<p>Robert Earnest Swetman (R.E.) was born January 13, 1942, the only son of E.S. and Bertha Swetman. 
For more information about visitation and the service or sign the guestbook go to <a href="http://moodydaniel.com/fh/home/home.cfm?&fh_id=14307" target="_new">Moody-Daniel Funeral Home</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Earnest Swetman (R.E.) was born January 13, 1942, the only son of E.S. and Bertha Swetman. He married the love of his life, Shirley Fay Farnell on November 8, 1958, and they began a life together that could only be separated by death. It wasnât always easy, but they followed through with the vows they made as teenagers. They raised three children in a home they built for themselves. Robert was a Master Plumber who partnered his own business-Clark Plumbing, serving Atlanta and surrounding areas for over 50 years until his recent retirement at age 79. Robert was a man of men who loved life and lived every minute to the fullest. He cared for his land and regularly managed a garden until just a few years ago. He spent hours helping Shirley can tomatoes during the summers and after she passed away in 2011, he continued the tradition. He loved boating, the beach, and the ocean with all of the bounties it provided. Robert enjoyed working on cars and fixing anything mechanical that needed his hands. He spent many a weekend dancing the night away with Shirley, tossing horse shoes, playing cards and throwing back a cold beer. No person or animal in need was ever turned away. Robert wasnât a materialistic man. The price of something didnât matter as long as it met his needs and made him happy. He was certainly someone you could depend on and someone you wanted to have your back. He loved his family fiercely. Robert departed us on April 16, 2024, following an unexpected illness.
</p>

<p>
He leaves behind his three children: Tracy-Boo (Terry), Samantha-Sam Booty (Richarda) and Clint-Sugar Boy (Melissa); grandchildren: Gage-T-Bone (Bobbi), Brody-Bo, Evan, Ethan, Trey and Saylor-Sweet P; adopted son, Kevin-Red Headed Stepchild and a handful of nieces and nephews.
</p>

<p>
He is preceded in death by his wife of 52 years, Shirley and numerous furbabies.
</p>

<p>
His Celebration of Life will be held at his home at 171 Salter Rd, Meansville on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at 5 pm. For those who would like to attend, BYOB, a covered dish, and a comfy chair as we gather to remember a life well lived.

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - The Friends of the J. Joel Edwards Library invite the community to join us for a fond fare-the-well celebration for longtime library manager, Rosemary Bunn. The event is being held on Tuesday, April 23, from 6:00 â 8:00 pm at the Zebulon City Park Pavilion. Friends and well-wishers are encouraged to drop by and help us honor Rosemary.
</p>

<p>
Rosemary retired late last year after serving the community and the library for more than thirteen years. For many in the county and community, Rosemary epitomized the library. She presented programs to the schools, instilling a love of books and reading in thousands of students. Her innovative annual Summer Reading Program events drew capacity crowds and high praise from those attending.
</p>

<p>In 2020, Rosemary was able to fulfill a dream of establishing a hands-on âmakers spaceâ at the library where the community could make use of high-end crafting equipment. This proved a boon to teachers, media specialists, and patrons. The maker space continues to thrive and will do so for years to come.
</p>

<p>
Rosemary has already embarked on new adventures. She intends on spending a fair amount of time playing in the dirt, as she whimsically refers to her love of gardening. Even so, we want to give her a proper send-off in appreciation of all she has done, and will continue to do, for Pike County.  
</p>

<p>
This is a casual, drop-in type party. We hope to see you there!

But this year, millions of periodical cicadas will be emerging in Georgia during the spring before Memorial Day. Brood XIX (âBrood 19â) is Georgiaâs only 13-year cicada and this is the largest periodical cicada brood in North America, âThe Great Southern Brood,â covering at least a dozen states in the Southeast.

			<div id="article_header">Pike County Times Reauthorizes 2017 Freedom<Br />of Information Act (FOIA) Request<br />By Editor Becky Watts</div>

<br />

<p>ZEBULON - Pike County Times became acquainted with Clayton Kuhles from MIA Recoveries, Inc. because of his work to bring home the airmen from the "Hot as Hell" crash that brought WWII Bombardier 1st Lt. Robert "Eugene" Oxford home to Concord in 2017. Kuhles discovered the crash site in 2006 in a remote part of India and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) brought home remains from 1st Lt. Oxford. You can read more about his long journey home to Concord in 2017 by <a href="http://www.pikecountytimes.com/secondary/BREAKINGNEWSoxford5.8.17.html#.X0iLCjUpDIV" target="_new">clicking here</a>.
</p>

<p>Pike County Times reported that the DPAA awarded a high bidder with a contract for Northeastern India Recovery Work in 2017. The solicitation was specifically to follow up on recovery of remains of WWII service members from sites in Northeast India where Kuhles had a lot of experience in recovery and a bid that was $428,000 less than the company who was awarded the contract. Kuhles placed a complaint with the Naval Inspector General, and Pike County Times placed a FOIA for information pertaining to this contract.</p>

<p>Pike County Times received an emailed letter from the Department of Defense FOIA Division advising that it regretted the delay in completing the request and asking if Pike County Times would still like to receive the information that has been requested along with its current caseload of 3,486 requests on August 28, 2020. (This request was one of 2,961 open requests on July 9, 2019.) The letter read as follows: "...we understand that due to the passage of time and changing needs of requesters, it is possible that you no longer have an interest in the documents you requested. Therefore, we ask that you review your enclosed request and confirm your continued interest in the requested information September 30, 2020." Pike County Times sent a letter authorizing the continuation of this FOIA by email today. When the information is finally received, Pike County Times will review and update the article.
