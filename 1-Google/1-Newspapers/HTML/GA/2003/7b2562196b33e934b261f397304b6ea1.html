      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="5">Dr. 
        Cano deserved his 1-year sentence</font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State Bar of Georgia has 
        rules of ethical conduct which prohibit a prosecutor from making public 
        comment about any matter which he is actively prosecuting. I have therefore 
        had to sit by in silence as I have read letter after letter to the editor 
        concerning Dr. Orlando Cano from some of his patients and how he was being 
        mistreated by the criminal justice system in Fayette County. Today the 
        silence breaks. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Dec. 3, 2003 Orlando Cano 
        pled no contest to the final criminal charge against him, simple battery. 
        As a result of plea negotiations, he offered no defense to the allegation 
        that he touched a patient in an insulting and provoking manner during 
        a gynecological examination. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trial on that charge resulted 
        in a mistrial in September of this year. Orlando Cano was convicted of 
        two counts of sexual battery against two of his former employees in November 
        of this year. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only reason he wasn&#146;t 
        convicted of a third count of sexual battery was that the victim testified 
        the offense was committed in his Stockbridge, Henry County, office, not 
        in Fayette County. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Orlando Cano was sentenced 
        to serve 12 months in jail on two counts, 12 months of probation on the 
        remaining count, a $10,000 fine and restricted from practicing medicine. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of the state&#146;s 
        case we amassed over 35 former patients who asserted that he fondled, 
        groped, or sexually abused them. In addition we located, and interviewed 
        approximately 12 former employees, and nursing staff form area hospitals 
        who asserted sexually abusive and harassing treatment from Orlando Cano. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At trial Orlando Cano asserted 
        that the witnesses were lying and making up stories, or that if he touched 
        them, it was accidental due to the close quarters within which they worked, 
        or that if he touched them, he couldn&#146;t help it because of his Hispanic 
        heritage. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such a defense was argued by 
        me to be ludicrous and insulting to a class of hard-working honest people. 
        The jury agreed. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Orlando Cano was a talented 
        physician who has helped many women. However, he misused and abused that 
        position of trust to victimize many women. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When this case got started, 
        we had a goal of ending his medical practice (therefore stemming the flow 
        of victims), holding him accountable for his conduct, and helping the 
        victims of his crimes. We accomplished our goal. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When questioned on the stand 
        about why she didn&#146;t immediately cry out when Cano grabbed her breast, 
        one nursing assistant from a local hospital testified on the stand that 
        she was a young, black female who didn&#146;t make the hospital any money, 
        and he was a physician. &#147;Who would believe me?&#148; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am proud to state that six 
        jurors and one prosecutor believed her. </font>
