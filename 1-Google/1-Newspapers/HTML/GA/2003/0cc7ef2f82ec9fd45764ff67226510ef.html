      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By <b>JOHN 
        MUNFORD<br>
        </b><i><a href="mailto:jmunford@TheCitizenNews.com%20">jmunford@TheCitizenNews.com</a></i></font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forget four. 
        Make it five. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carl Millard 
        Patton Jr., who has already pled guilty to four murders including one 
        tied to Fayette County has been indicted for a 30-year-old Henry County 
        murder case. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the latest 
        case lodged against him, Patton is accused of murdering Richard Russell 
        Jackson in 1973 in exchange for $2,500 cash. Lt. Col. Bruce Jordan of 
        the Fayette County Sheriff's Department said Patton has admitted to killing 
        Jackson for the money. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patton has 
        told police that he hasn't been involved with any other murders, but Jordan 
        didn't sound so sure about that claim. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You'd 
        have to believe that he killed for about a four-year period and stopped 
        for the rest of his life,&quot; Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I couldn't 
        say for any certainty&quot; whether Patton will ever be linked to any 
        other killings, the chief detective said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In February, 
        Patton pled guilty to the murder of Liddie Matthews Evans, a Jonesboro 
        woman whose body was found just on the Fayette side of the Flint River. 
        He also pled guilty to murdering Cleveland, who was Evans' boyfriend, 
        and two other people whom Cleveland helped Patton kill. The case was adjudicated 
        in DeKalb County because that's where the killings actually occurred at 
        the Patton's residence. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cases are 
        the oldest in Georgia to use DNA analysis evidence seized at the original 
        scene of the crime to convict the killer, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patton's wife, 
        Norma, testified in court that she saw her husband shoot Evans and Cleveland 
        at their DeKalb County home. She said he killed the couple because he 
        was afraid Cleveland had told Evans about several of the other murders 
        Cleveland had assisted her husband with. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patton also 
        claims that he is not tied to the Dixie Mafia, Jordan said. Instead, he 
        ties that link to a &quot;story&quot; cooked up by a drug dealer who he 
        used to collect money for; the story reportedly made Patton appear more 
        intimidating, particularly since he wore a handgun in a holster at his 
        side at all times, according to witnesses. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was, 
        'You better pay up or Hotshot's gonna get you,'&quot; Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patton told 
        Jordan that he had set up an attack on Jackson by arranging to meet him 
        in 1973 under the pretext of showing him a gun that Patton wanted to sell. 
        As Jackson was drove along, Patton said he thought they were being followed, 
        and he asked Jackson to pull over, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's when 
        Patton shot at Jackson and missed, Jordan said. But an accomplice, Joe 
        Cleveland whom Patton shot and killed several years later shot and hit 
        Jackson as he tried to flee, killing him, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patton and 
        Cleveland didn't know Jackson had died until the next day when Jackson's 
        wife, Marie Jackson Wyatt, was notified that police found her husband's 
        body. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marie Jackson 
        Wyatt, who is now deceased, would have likely been considered a murder 
        suspect herself were she alive, Jordan has said. She died in 1988 but 
        the cause of her death is not suspicious in nature, Jordan added.</font>
