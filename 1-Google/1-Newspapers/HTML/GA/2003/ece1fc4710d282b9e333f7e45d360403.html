      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="5">The truth 
        about the 91st Psalm</font></b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">By <b>MARY JANE HOLT</b><br>
        <i>Contributing Writer</i></font> </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of 
        weeks ago I asked you to help me find information about the 91st Infantry 
        Brigade of the U.S. Expeditionary Army and WWI. Legend has it that the 
        men of the 91st Infantry Brigade had never seen combat. Their commander, 
        a devout Christian, called an assembly of his men where he gave each a 
        little card on which was printed the 91st Psalm. They agreed to recite 
        the Soldiers' Psalm daily. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsequently, 
        the 91st Brigade was engaged in three of the bloodiest battles of WWI: 
        Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood, and the Argonne. While other American units 
        similarly engaged had up to 90 percent casualties, it is said that the 
        91st Brigade did not suffer a single casualty! </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since I asked 
        for help verifying this information I have seen the little book &quot;The 
        Ultimate Guide - Psalm 91&quot; by Brenda and Michael Pink, and read the 
        story that is printed on the most recently designed cover. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I also have 
        had several responses to queries regarding the legendary 91st Infantry 
        Brigade. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This response 
        came from Mike Hanlon, Research Editor of Relevance, the Quarterly Journal 
        of The Great War Society: &quot;There was no 91st Brigade with the AEF 
        in WWI. The Brigades' highest number was 84. There was, however, a 91st 
        Division and that may be what you are looking for. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was 
        known as the Wild West Division and was made up mostly of draftees from 
        the west coast. They trained at Fort Lewis, Washington. It went over the 
        top the first day of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, taking pretty heavy 
        casualties. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was 
        taken out of the line to rest and regroup, and in late October, 1918 was 
        sent to Flanders with the 37th Division of the AEF to fight the final 
        weeks of the war under King Albert of Belgium. Their total casualties 
        were about 6,100 men including 1,454 killed.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later I received 
        further correspondence from Mr. Hanlon: &quot;I have seen this story about 
        the 91st Psalm. In one variation, the source of the story is the father 
        of the late actor James Stewart, who served in the non-existent 91st Brigade. 
        The story continues to suggest that father passed it on to son when James 
        Stewart departed for WWII. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I have 
        never been able to verify the truth of any of this. However, it is quite 
        credible that the 91st Psalm was distributed to some soldiers by their 
        commanders before battle. It has many comforting thoughts for those in 
        jeopardy.&quot; </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then Mr. Hanlon 
        went on to tell me about how the Great War Society conducts a major event 
        each Armistice/Veterans Day. This past year they joined with the Gold 
        Star Mothers of America at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco to rededicate 
        their monument listing the 700+ fallen sons and daughters of their Bay 
        Area chapter members killed in the war. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The list, incidentally, 
        includes members of the 91st Division. Hanlon was asked to host the event. 
        Since we currently have forces in action around the world, he thought 
        they should add something to honor and help the group remember our current 
        day warriors. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Naturally, 
        I read the King James version of the 91st Psalm,&quot; he said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how does 
        this bit of historical information affect my faith and my feelings about 
        Psalm 91? I am not sure it does. You see, what faith I have is not built 
        on stories, but on experience and what I perceive to be a personal relationship 
        with God. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do I feel 
        at this point about the little book, &quot;Psalm 91: The Ultimate Shield&quot;? 
        It is awesome! I now have a copy in my purse, but it is not the book that 
        brings me comfort, but my perceived truth of the Psalm. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I love 
        the story of the 91st Infantry Brigade of the U.S. Expeditionary Army 
        and WWI. I really wanted it to be true. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A friend of 
        mine asked me why I was so bent on trying to prove or disprove it. &quot;It's 
        a good story. Why can't you just leave it alone?&quot; he asked. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Truth, even 
        in its purest state, can be so very hard to recognize. Even when we think 
        we catch a glimpse of the real thing, we often find it to be ever so elusive. 
        I suppose I was born searching for truth. In death, I fully expect to 
        continue my quest. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do think 
        our faith grows with the hearing and telling of good stories. I just want 
        to know, as far as it is humanly possibly to know, that the stories I 
        hear and tell are true. Is that too much to ask? </font>

        whose appetite for WWI history may have been whetted by this column can
