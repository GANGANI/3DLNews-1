      <p><b><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2nd twin gets life 
        + 25 years in chase death </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By <b>JOHN MUNFORD<br>
        </b><i><a href="mailto:jmunford@TheCitizenNews.com%20">jmunford@TheCitizenNews.com 
        </a></i> </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Atlanta man was convicted 
        Monday of killing an innocent motorist after robbing a south Fayetteville 
        grocery store at gunpoint with his twin brother and leading police on 
        a brief chase Easter Sunday last year. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Melvin Edward Mitchell, 23, 
        was also found guilty of killing Union City veterinarian Jason Trotman 
        when the vehicle he drove crashed into Trotman's vehicle which was waiting 
        at the intersection of Ga. Highway 85 and north Jeff Davis Drive. Mitchell 
        was also convicted of armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the 
        commission of a crime, fleeing and attempting to elude a police officer 
        and two counts each of kidnapping and false imprisonment. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mitchell was sentenced to life 
        in prison plus 25 years by Superior Court Judge Tommy Hankinson. His twin 
        brother, Marvin Edwin Mitchell, received the same sentence last week after 
        he was found guilty of murder, armed robbery, possession of a firearm 
        during the commission of a crime and two counts each of kidnapping and 
        false imprisonment. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Witnesses in both trials testified 
        that two armed and masked men entered the Ingles store just before it 
        closed Easter Sunday. One of the men jumped a counter to an office area 
        and forced one of the victims to empty the safe at gunpoint, witnesses 
        testified. Others in the store were ordered to the ground, according to 
        testimony. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Melvin Mitchell's 
        attorney argued the police were at fault for causing the chase, assistant 
        district attorney Dan Hiatt said that wasn't the case. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The right foot under 
        that table is the foot that was on that gas pedal,&quot; Hiatt said, pointing 
        to the defendant. &quot;The hands in that lap were driving that steering 
        wheel. ... The choice he could've made was to pull over.&quot; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mitchell's attorney, Judy Chidester 
        countered that the prosecution didn't test the guns that were recovered 
        from Mitchell's vehicle for fingerprints and they didn't test the masks 
        taken from the vehicle for any hair fibers. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I want you to consider 
        the evidence the state didn't put in,&quot; Chidester said. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fayetteville police officer 
        Robert Mask testified that his vehicle reached speeds of 110 mph on north 
        Jeff Davis Drive trying to catch up to Mitchell's vehicle trying to get 
        a tag number. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At that point, &quot;I was 
        slowly gaining on the vehicle but it had gained some distance on me,&quot; 
        Mask said, adding that he felt safe to pursue the vehicle because of the 
        light traffic that evening. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The in-car video camera on 
        Mask's patrol vehicle was malfunctioning during the pursuit, but he testified 
        that he attempted to pull over the Mitchell's vehicle with his blue lights 
        and siren activated since the vehicle matched the description relayed 
        to 911 dispatchers by an eyewitness. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the collision occurred, 
        it flipped over Trotman's sport utility vehicle, Mask testified. After 
        the collision, two black males exited Mitchell's vehicle and were later 
        caught on foot by Fayetteville police officers and deputies from the Fayette 
        County Sheriff's Department. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fayetteville police officer 
        J.D. Lakeman testified that he was present when Melvin Mitchell was treated 
        at the Fayette Community Hospital Emergency Room after he was arrested. 
        At that time, Mitchell told the nurse that he was injured in a motor vehicle 
        collision. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He told her his name 
        was Melvin Mitchell,&quot; Lakeman said. &quot;... He said he was in the 
        driver's seat of the vehicle.&quot; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Kryzsztof Podjaski, a medical 
        examiner with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said an autopsy of 
        Trotman's body revealed that he died of a severe injury to his spinal 
        cord. </font>
