      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By <b>JOHN 
        MUNFORD<br>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wife of 
        accused murderer Carl Millard Patton Jr. testified in court Thursday that 
        she witnessed her husband shoot Liddie Matthews Evans and Evans' boyfriend 
        Joe Cleveland at the Patton's home in DeKalb County over 25 years ago. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He and 
        Joe were going back and forth with a gun, playing with it, cutting up,&quot; 
        Norma J. Patton said of her husband. When the time was right, Carl Patton 
        shot Evans twice and then shot Cleveland once, she testified. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mrs. Patton 
        said her husband wanted Evans and Cleveland dead because he thought Cleveland 
        had told Evans about another murder Cleveland and he had committed together. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before Evans 
        and Cleveland were shot to death, Carl Patton Jr. and Cleveland about 
        a month prior had killed Patton's uncle Fred Wyatt and his wife at the 
        time, Betty Jo Ephlin, testified Maj. Bruce Jordan of the Fayette County 
        Sheriff's Department. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of 
        Mrs. Patton's testimony that the murder occurred in DeKalb County, State 
        Court Judge Fletcher Sams dismissed the murder charges here in Fayette 
        County. District Attorney Bill McBroom said murder warrants for Patton 
        had already been secured in DeKalb County due to the testimony of Mrs. 
        Patton. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mrs. Patton 
        has received immunity from prosecution from Fayette, DeKalb and Clayton 
        counties for the murders even though she admitted to having helped plan 
        and execute the killings. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Family members 
        of the victims wept as they heard the details of the deaths from Mrs. 
        Patton in open court. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the killings, 
        the Pattons dragged the bodies out of the house to a camper in the backyard, 
        Mrs. Patton said. Mrs. Patton said she then began cleaning up the blood 
        from the house. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mrs. Patton 
        positively identified the photos of Cleveland and Evans as the two persons 
        killed by her husband in their home. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A sofa cushion 
        with a blood stain on it was confiscated a quarter-century ago from the 
        camper in the Pattons' residence, police said. Detectives used modern-day 
        DNA technology to use samples from DNA from Evans's daughter and her father 
        to create a composite sample of Liddie Evans's DNA, said Jordan, who led 
        the investigation. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The blood from 
        the sofa cushion matched the DNA compilation sample of Liddie Evans, Jordan 
        testified. Detectives were unable to get a DNA sample directly from Liddie 
        Evans's remains when her body was exhumed late last year, Jordan said. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Blood was also 
        found in the wooden floorboard of the camper, which had been painted over 
        to hide the blood, Jordan testified. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Norma Patton 
        testified that she helped dispose of Evans's body in the Flint River between 
        Clayton and Fayette counties and Cleveland's body at another location 
        in the river the day after the killings. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carl Patton 
        Jr. and Norma Patton were originally arrested for the murders days after 
        Evans's and Ephlin's bodies were found in the Flint River. The arrest 
        was based on blood found in the trunk of the Pattons' vehicles, Jordan 
        testified. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evans's body 
        was found just on the Fayette side of the Flint River, and Jordan ran 
        across the old case file when he was writing a true crime book on murders 
        in Fayette County. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jordan decided 
        then that the physical evidence in the case if it could still be found 
        could help solve the murder. After some time, several pieces of physical 
        evidence were found that tied Carl Patton to the murder, Jordan testified. 
        </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of the 
        physical evidence was found in the evidence room of the Clayton County 
        Police Department, which is the agency that also investigated the murders 
        since two of the victims were found in Clayton's jurisdiction, Jordan 
        said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concrete 
        blocks chained to some of the murder victims and the sleeping bag Evans's 
        body was found in will also be used in the case, Jordan explained. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Georgia 
        Bureau of Investigation's crime lab was also key in deciding to reanalyze 
        the evidence from the 25-year-old case, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It took the 
        GBI some time to find its original case file on the murders, so detectives 
        worked for about a month using information from newspaper accounts that 
        were published at the time, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mrs. Patton 
        agreed to cooperate with authorities minutes after the sheriff's department 
        arrested her husband at their Locust Grove home almost two weeks ago, 
        Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another witness 
        who claimed to have known Carl Patton from a series of drug transactions 
        after the murders will testify that Carl Patton admitted to &quot;killing 
        the people that were found in the river&quot; but not his uncle, Fred 
        Wyatt, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wyatt's death 
        was originally ruled an accident after his body was found in a car that 
        had been struck by a train. His remains were exhumed by the GBI a year 
        later and it was found that he actually died from a gunshot wound to the 
        head, Jordan said. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Norma Patton 
        testified that she heard her husband and others talk about how Wyatt died 
        and that her husband was familiar with the area where the vehicle was 
        struck by the train because Carl Patton had lived there for years. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jordan also 
        spoke of several other witnesses who will help prove the murder case against 
        Carl Patton. One witness saw Carl Patton burn a sofa, a suitcase and other 
        items, Jordan said. Mrs. Patton testified that Carl Patton was worried 
        about physical evidence being found on them. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Liddie 
        Evans's mother Margie has died, she was interviewed by detectives before 
        her death, Jordan said. The victim's mother said at the time that her 
        daughter had told her Cleveland had murdered several people along with 
        Carl Patton. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jordan said 
        he first ran across information on the case while doing research for his 
        book in 1997. He declined to act on his hunch then because he was busy 
        working on the Beverley Watson missing persons case that turned into a 
        homicide case. </font>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fayette County 
        Sheriff Randall Johnson, who was in his first year in office when Evans's 
        body turned up here in 1977, authorized reopening the case last year, 
        Jordan said. </font>
