        "><div class="c-contentElements" data-start-index="0"><p class="story-text " data-index="1">Originally published Nov. 25, 2005</p><p class="story-text " data-index="2">DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Vernon Jones declared himself exonerated last month of a rape accusation. Prosecutors, he said, confronted his accuser and “convinced [her] to cease the false allegations.”</p><div class="MP02 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><div class="RP01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="5">The alleged victim, however, stands by her accusation, according to a lawyer who has advised her. And DeKalb District Attorney Gwen Keyes Fleming said at the time that she dropped the investigation because the woman wanted to avoid the trauma of a trial.</p></div><div class="story-paygate_placeholder"><div class="c-contentElements" data-start-index="5"><p class="story-text " data-index="6">A review by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of witness statements and other newly released documents from the closed investigation suggests the matter was far more complex than Jones contended.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="7">The documents draw no conclusion about whether Jones, 45, committed a crime or whether the allegation against him is false. But they contain the accuser's detailed claim that Jones held down the 29-year-old Lithonia woman at his south DeKalb home last December and raped her following a sexual encounter with her and another woman. The accuser told investigators that Jones apologized before she left, and pleaded with her not to "hurt" him.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="8">The woman acknowledged that she told Jones their sexual encounter was consensual. But she told police she said that so she could leave.</p><p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"></p><p class="story-text " data-index="10">Because of the woman's desire to avoid a trial, the public will have no opportunity to assess her or Jones' credibility in a public proceeding. The investigative file, public under Georgia law after the close of the nine-month investigation, allows the public to draw its own conclusions about a criminal allegation against one of the region's most powerful elected officials.</p><div class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="12">On at least four occasions, the alleged victim gave police the same account of the Dec. 28 episode with Jones and his off-and-on girlfriend. Jones' friend corroborated much of the woman's account of the early part of the evening, but she told investigators the accuser was a willing participant in fondling and other sexual activity before the alleged rape. The friend said she left Jones' home before the rape purportedly occurred.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="13">Details of the evening emerge from more than 400 pages of statements by the accuser, Jones' friend and others. Released by the district attorney on Nov. 4 in response to an open records request, the documents give the first full account of the allegations against DeKalb County's top elected official.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="14">Jones refused to answer investigators' questions, records show, but issued public statements maintaining that all sexual activity was consensual. Through his lawyer, Dwight Thomas, he declined requests for an interview.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="15">Thomas aggressively denies the woman's accusations.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="16">"The CEO didn't rape the woman," Thomas said in an interview last week. "There was no rape. There was no brutality. Nobody beat her up. Nobody tore her panties off."</p><div class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><div class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="19">The woman did not say Jones beat her or ripped her clothing, but she did allege Jones raped her.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="20">Regardless, Thomas added: "Simply because she said it does not make it true."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="21">Keyes Fleming, the district attorney, declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the merits of the woman's claim. Authorities are still investigating whether DeKalb police officers tipped off Jones before detectives even finished taking the woman's statement.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="22">Jones’ accuser -- whose name is being withheld by the Journal-Constitution because she says she was the victim of a sex crime -- has not recanted her claim of rape, said Antje Kingma, an Atlanta lawyer and former sex crimes prosecutor who has advised the woman as a victim’s advocate.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="23">Kingma said she believes prosecutors had enough evidence to take the matter to trial.</p><div class="c-section"><div class="story-interscroller__placeholder full-width c-clear-both c-contentElements"></div></div><p class="story-text " data-index="25">"This case absolutely could have been taken to a jury," she said. "He [Jones] has not been exonerated. The victim couldn't take it anymore."</p><h3 class="h3-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">A chance meeting</h3><p class="story-text " data-index="27">They met by chance, during a break in a DeKalb County Commission meeting last December, according to the recently released investigative files. Jones struck up a conversation with the woman, who was there to meet a departing commissioner and for professional networking as she looked for work. She said later she handed Jones and several other people her business card, on which she had written the number of her cellphone.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="28">At her church, the woman had counseled girls who had been raped and abused. That work was personal; as a child, an adult molested her, according to her statements to investigators, and as a teenager, she was the victim of a date rape.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="29">On Christmas Day, the woman was visiting relatives out of state when Jones called her cellphone. She said she agreed to get in touch when she got home.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="30">On Dec. 28, the woman called Jones. They met for lunch that day at the Houston's restaurant in Buckhead.</p><div class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="32">"Of course, he was being recognized by most of the people," she later told police, "so I just kind of stood off to the side, you know, while he greeted and did his politician-type thing."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="33">During lunch, the woman said, Jones asked about her life -- what she considered typical first-date questions.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="34">Soon, the conversation took "a really crazy turn," she said, when Jones described himself as "heated." She said he told her: "You seem like you have the potential to be really . . . nasty."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="35">She responded: "Well, could be, you know, with the right guy. You know, at the right time." She also told him she felt a connection between them, the woman told investigators.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="36">Jones invited the woman to his house that evening, she said, but she didn’t give a firm answer</p><div class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="38">On the telephone later, she said, Jones asked her again to come over to "just hang out" with him and a former girlfriend whom he still dated at times. She said she felt more comfortable knowing a third person would be present, even though she told investigators that Jones suggested she and his friend stay for a "sleepover." She said she responded that she had no intention of having sex with him or with him and his friend.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="39">She said she "drew what I thought would be a boundary. And he said OK."</p><h3 class="h3-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">Drinks, then dancing</h3><p class="story-text " data-index="41">When the woman arrived at Jones’ house, he was at the kitchen counter mixing drinks -- peach daiquiris, she recalled; margaritas, according to Jones’ friend, who had arrived earlier. The newspaper is not identifying Jones’ friend because of the intimate nature of her statements to investigators.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="42">They roasted miniature marshmallows in the fireplace, danced and then sat on a sofa, with Jones between the two women. According to both women, Jones and his friend kissed, and Jones draped his arm around the other woman.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="43">Several times, the alleged victim said, Jones put his hand up her shirt, but she pushed him away. She said he placed her hand on his crotch.</p><div class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="45">Both women said Jones then led them into his bedroom. The alleged victim said she tried to pull away, but Jones persisted. Jones' friend said the woman voiced no objection, but asked whether the other two had been tested for sexually transmitted diseases.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="46">The alleged victim told police that Jones and his friend took off their clothes but she hesitated. She said Jones told her she was making his friend uncomfortable and being "a problem."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="47">The woman said she was afraid, but undressed anyway. During the sexual contact that followed, she said, Jones held her arm and legs to keep her in bed.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="48">When he loosened his grasp, she said, she got up and locked herself in a bathroom. The experience with Jones and his friend, she said, left her feeling "horrible and dirty."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="49">But Jones' friend told investigators that the other woman's participation was consensual: "At one point, she leaned over and put her hands on my arm and said, 'I just want you to know that I'm OK. Thank you.' "</p><div class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="51">About 3 a.m., the friend decided to go home, and the women dressed.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="52">Thomas, Jones' lawyer, said Jones' friend told an investigator that both women left at about the same time. But Jones' friend told police that the alleged victim remained in the house as she drove away, and her attorney, Abbi Taylor Guest, said the woman has not said she saw the alleged victim leave.</p><h3 class="h3-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">‘I trusted you’</h3><p class="story-text " data-index="54">After the other woman left, Jones' accuser told police that he coaxed her into returning to his bedroom. He was "trying to console me and make sure everything was OK," the woman told investigators. "And it was better."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="55">But she was scared. "If I leave here and he doesn't think I'm OK, you know, then he can find me," she said she thought. "I live in DeKalb. My house is here. You know, I just wanted things to be OK. I didn't want any problems. I didn't want any trouble."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="56">Jones was undressed, she said, and told her "he trusted me to come there . . . and just to give him another chance." She said he told her it would be "a lot nicer" if she took her clothes off, too. "He was, like, trying to negotiate me out of my clothes."</p><div class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="58">She said Jones told her he had "messed up" earlier in the night. "You just wanted to talk and what have you and, you know, we did a lot more," she recalled Jones saying to her. "But I'm not going to do that again."</p><p class="story-text " data-index="59">"And I believed him," the woman told investigators.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.
