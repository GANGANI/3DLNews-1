The white Greek Revival manse is the former home of Alfred Holt Colquitt, a Confederate major general, and later Georgia governor and U.S. senator.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="72">Many manners of the period are intact, too.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="73">One fixture of the mansion is the 81-year-old butler, Will Rudolph, whom the Harberts kept on after they bought the plantation from U.S. Steel.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="74">“Mr. Harbert immediately liked me,” says Rudolph. “If he really wanted to know what was going on at Pinebloom, he’d ask me. He told me I was a member of the family.”</p><div class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "></div><p class="story-text " data-index="76">In the mansion’s downstairs study, there’s a photograph of Rudolph and Wita Harbert standing in front of the mansion’s azalea garden and holding by the feet a dead wild turkey Wita shot for Thanksgiving.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="77">We eat lunch (vegetable soup and corn bread sticks) at the Skeet House, a mannish, dark-paneled clubroom with a fireplace and virtually every variety of local game —  turkey, deer, bass, wild boar —  mounted on the wall. We are served by black help dressed in white smocks and aprons. Lunch is summoned with a dinner bell.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="78">The most symbolic fixture and tradition of a quail plantation is the hunting wagon: a polished wood rig with pneumatic tires, two expensive leather car seat benches, pulled by mules in requisite handsome leather and brass-knobbed harnesses.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="79">At Woodhaven, Charles Loudermilk’s mule driver, Willie Johnson —  an employee on the plantation almost as long as the 17 years Loudermilk has owned it —  wore a dusty cap that says: “Every Day’s Just Another Slice of Honey Dew Melon.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="80">J.L.

Pinebloom has a kennel of 50 pointers and retrievers (not far from the pasture with the plantation’s 20 horses and mules).</p><p class="story-text " data-index="100">But, only in their eternal repose do you get a true sense of the bird dog’s caste.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="101">In this world a good bird dog —  which can cost $20,000 —  is revered.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="102">A great dog is enshrined.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="103">Underneath towering live oaks a few hundred yards from the main house, Moon walks through the dog graveyard, surrounded by a short white picket fence.

And that purpose is to propagate wild quail.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="115">At whatever cost.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="116">In the old days when, for instance, Coca-Cola patriarch Robert Woodruff bought parcels of land and built his famous 30,000-acre quail plantation and retreat, Ichauway, land sold for $1 an acre or less. That was the late 1920s.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="117">Two years ago, when Limited Chairman Wexner bought 8,000 acres of the old Tallassee Plantation, he paid $17 million.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="118">He promptly renamed it Abigail (after his wife), tore down the old plantation home and is building a 30,000-square-foot showpiece.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="119">Nobody buys a plantation for profit.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="120">“If you think a quail plantation can take care of itself, you’re crazy,” says Ben Hardaway. A wealthy Columbus construction company executive and self-published author (“Never Outfoxed: The Hunting Life of Benjamin H. Hardaway III”), he once owned the Lee County quail plantation Senah.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="121">“There’s no way to make one break even, or even come close,” Hardaway says.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="122">Curt Hall, owner of Plantation Services in Albany, the chief broker of quail plantations in the state, estimates the cost of annual maintenance between $100,000 and $600,000.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="123">What that translates into is this: You can buy quail at the grocery for about $2 a piece. On the most efficiently run plantation, that bird you’re about to bite into for dinner cost roughly $3,000.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="124">But that hasn’t dimmed the appeal.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="125">“I get calls all the time from people who say, ‘Look, if you’ve got something, call me,’ " says Hall. “There are more people out there who want one than places available.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="126">Pinebloom’s operation is typical for its size.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="127">The plantation has a year-round staff of 18 and enough equipment to build a highway: a pair of $130,000 front-end loaders; a road grader; dump truck; and fleet of pickups, not to mention farm equipment to work the assortment of crops grown mainly to feed the quail population.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="128">Corn, millet, wheat, sorghum.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="129">The process of creating a “natural” quail habitat is as meticulous and never-ending as building a Japanese garden. Hardwoods are bulldozed, stacked and burned because they create too much shade and thwart the growth of the underbrush where quail breed and thrive.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="130">There are some environmental benefits in this. The remaining stands of longleaf pine in Georgia still exist mainly because of quail plantation owners’ policy of thinning and burning.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="131">Pines are planted and thinned in precise rows, again to allow the growth of underbrush. Between these sparse areas are spaced “safe havens”: thickets of briars impenetrable to man or shotgun pellet.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="132">Without a place to flee the hunt after they’ve been flushed, quail might move to the property next door. Interspersed between these are feed plots of corn and wheat and seed sprinkled by crews constantly working the woods.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="133">Usually the day after quail season, the burning begins. On a properly maintained quail plantation, 60 percent of the land is burned to keep the underbrush down and flush out and kill the rodent and snake population.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="134">Every year.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="135">A hunter can tell an obsessively kept quail habitat by the black scorch marks at the base of the pine trees.</p><h3 class="h3-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">Sharing secrets</h3><p class="story-text " data-index="137">In the fall before quail season, Tallahassee-based Tall Timbers Research Station, a group funded by plantation owners (annual budget: $350,000) to perfect the art of propagating wild quail, hosts an annual seminar.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="138">Between a barbecue lunch outdoors under a yawning canvas and tours of the grounds, researchers and wildlife experts offer plantation managers and owners the latest findings.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="139">Which are always the same.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="140">Do whatever is legal and environmentally sound —  or, at least unassailable by the Environmental Protection Agency —  to eliminate everything that stands between you and a thriving quail population.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="141">That includes trapping, in many cases killing, quail predators —  including raccoon, fox, bobcat, coyotes, possum, even deer, which eat the grain intended for the birds.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="142">The first week of November, the group held its annual Fall Field Day at Foshalee Plantation in Florida, just south of the Georgia line. The parking lot was filled with pickups and sport-utility vehicles.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="143">The crowd of about 250 was mostly dressed for the bush.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="144">Before lunch, the group caravaned around the property, stopping for demonstrations. At one, a state wildlife agent demonstrated dog-proof traps for raccoon and fox.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="145">“This one works real well capturing ‘coon,” explained the agent, holding up one in a series of metal contraptions. “And it’s a lot less chewing (off their own legs). So it’s more humane.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="146">The agent offered another tip for bait. Something dogs won’t eat.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="147">Marshmallows.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="148">After lunch, a succession of plantation managers offered their secrets to creating the perfect quail haven. Bob Walthall, manager of Sunny Hill, explained that his “boss’s goal is to shoot a covey rise every 15 minutes a hunt. And last year, we shot a little better than four coveys an hour.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="149">To achieve that required, among other things, removing 2,000 tractor-trailer loads of hardwood from the plantation.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="150">“My boss calls me two or three times a week,” said Walthall. “And he never asks how the trees are doing.”</p><h3 class="h3-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">Country clubbing</h3><p class="story-text " data-index="152">One of the main reasons that Charles Loudermilk took Aaron Rents public in 1982 was to raise the cash to buy a plantation. He had fallen in love with quail hunting in the 1960s.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="153">Finally, he could afford his dream game preserve.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="154">Before quail season, he shoots dove. And, west of the house is a duck pond with blinds. Duck season is coming, too. And crews put out feed to keep the flocks around.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="155">He is fastidious about maintaining Woodhaven. The property has a full-time staff of eight. And, if there’s anything that galls Loudermilk, it’s litter on the property.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="156">“If I find trash —  a can or a cigarette butt —  I think, ‘What slovenliness,’ " he says. Even with his wealth, he runs Woodhaven on a tight budget.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="157">“I’m really liking my $10 magnolias,” he says, as we wheel past several of the newly purchased trees, 4 feet tall, sitting under an oak tree in plastic pots. A sprinkler is watering them.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="158">“In Atlanta, those would cost $50.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="159">Golf has gone well this morning.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="160">Loudermilk’s had three pars.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="161">He’s beating the reporter by a stroke. Not difficult.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="162">Still, his wife had joked before the round, “Charlie can’t stand to lose.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="163">On the tee box of No. 5 we come upon a turtle, black and about the size of a Frisbee. What transpires is the kind of scene Tom Wolfe would have loved to have witnessed researching his novel.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="164">Like Wolfe’s account of the quail crowd watching horses mate, for amusement, in “A Man in Full” —  which the author says he saw happen —  it seems pure fiction.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="165">“What’s that?” asks the reporter.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="166">“A turtle,” says Charlie Loudermilk. “I think it’s dead.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="167">Loudermilk pulls out his 7-iron and flips the turtle over. It starts crawling away.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="168">“It’s alive,” says the reporter.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="169">“Not for long,” says Loudermilk.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="170">“You’re going to kill it?”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="171">“You’re damn right I’m going to kill it. They eat baby ducks.”</p><p class="story-text " data-index="172">He takes the 7-iron and whacks at the turtle’s head several times, missing. Finally, on the fifth blow, he cracks the shell with a sickening crunch. Crimson blood oozes out.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="173">He wipes the club on the grass. Picks another club and tees off. His shot finds the green, and he pars the hole.</p><p class="story-text " data-index="174">When we get back to the main house, he strolls the grounds with the plantation manager, chatting. That afternoon on the tee box of the fifth hole, the turtle is gone.</p></div></div></div></span><span data-pagezone="post-article-body"><div class="c-section full-width b-clear-both"></div><div class="c-section full-width b-clear-both"><div class="c-blogAuthor b-margin-bottom-30 "><p class="blogAuthor-title">About the Author</p><div class="blog-author-content"><div class="b-flexRow blog-author-content-heading "><div class="content-authorName">Jeffry Scott</div></div></div></div><div class="mostReadTitle">Editors&#x27; Picks</div><div class="c-ttd-feature editors-picks"><div class="c-homeLeadContainer left-photo-display-class one-column"><div class="column-1"><div class="home-headline "><a href="/news/atlanta-news/investor-purchases-of-atlanta-housing-top-1-billion-in-three-months/LLWFDSJHL5F7LHQJIKRGGZ3RBA/" class="homeList-image"><div class="c-image-component    image-landscape"><div class="image-component-image "><div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"><div class="lazyload-wrapper"><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/az8Bu442wJMtrtsmTbVHtmz21WE=/500x282/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/LKN5TFQXRFAZXD5UOALRTXFBGU.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Winslow at Eagles Landing neighborhood, where large number of homes are owned by investors, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2023, in McDonough.
