Hall is a graduate of UCLA and the UCLA Anderson School of Business. She served as Vice Chairman of the deadCENTER Board last year and led the search for deadCENTER’s fantastic new Executive Director, Lissa Blaschke. 
Hall is a long time community leader who has served as Chairman of the Board for Allied Arts, the Westminster School, the Oklahoma School of Science & Mathematics and the University Hospital Foundation; Vice-Chair for the Central Oklahoma Humane Society and the Oklahoma City Zoo Trust; Film Committee Chair for the Oklahoma City Museum of Art; and, board member for the Cultural Development Corporation, Oklahoma Zoological Society, and Nichols Hills Board of Adjustment.

Julie Hall is married to Kirk Hall and mother to NYU graduate Bryan Hall and Boston University graduate and former deadCENTER intern Kendall Hall. 
Joining Hall on the Executive Board are Vice Chair John Kennedy, Treasurer Carol Johnson, Secretary Ashley Byrnes and Past Chair Art Cotton.

And, perhaps most importantly, Cotton worked with incoming Chair Julie Hall to restructure the organization and add a fourth person to the staff.  
Returning board members that will continue to lead deadCENTER include Barbara Cable, Sally Ferrell, Peter Fulmer, Bryan Geiger, Debbie Nauser, Heather Ross, Kimber Shoop and Paige Williams. 
deadCENTER also added the following new Board Members for 2016: Emily Blaschke, First Vice President at MidFirst Bank and former Financial Planning Specialist for Chesapeake Energy Corporation; Bryan King, President of Fellers Snider Law Firm, Heritage Hall graduate and former President of the Red Bud Classic Board; Robert Miner, Senior Human Resources Project Manager for The Boeing Company, Oklahoma State University graduate and Oklahoma lead for First Robotics Competition; and, Mike Palmer, Associate General Counsel for Devon Energy Corporation, University of Oklahoma graduate and former President of the Arts Council of Oklahoma City.
Now in its 16th year, deadCENTER is Oklahoma’s largest film festival and one of the “20 Coolest Film Festivals in the World” according to MovieMaker magazine. deadCENTER educates more than 3,000 high school students each year through its statewide education program and attracts 30,000 to its annual film festival in June. In 2016, deadCENTER will launch the deadCENTER Institute to provide continuing education programs to working Oklahoma filmmakers. If you would like to find out more information about how you and your family, foundation or company can support the year round programs of the deadCENTER Film Festival, please email Executive Director Lissa Blaschke at lissa@ deadcenterfilm.org.</div><div class="Read_more"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/julie-hall-to-chair-deadcenter-board-p10427-174.htm" class="Read_more_heading"><span class="Read_more_heading heading_174" style="display: block;">(more)</span></a> </div></div></div><div id="main_SEC_601"><div id="image_SEC_601"><a href="https://okcfriday.com/christmas-movies-in-december-p10409-174.htm" ><img class="img_SCE_601"src="https://okcfriday.com/lib/images/blank.png"></a> </div><div class="body_SEC_wrap"><div id="heading_SEC_601"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/christmas-movies-in-december-p10409-174.htm" class="heading_SCE_601 heading_174">Christmas movies in December</a> </div><div id="date_SEC_601"><div class="IssueDate_SEC601 heading_174"><span class="layout_date"></span><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetArticleDate("12/4/2015");</script></div></div><div class="body_SEC_601">Thanks to the colossal improvements to our urban core, downtown Oklahoma City now boasts more family Christmas activities than the North Pole. From ice-skating and snow tubing to pop up shops and Santa stops, there is something for everyone to enjoy this holiday season. Luckily, there are also several places to enjoy classic Christmas movies with your family throughout December. 
As part of their Tuesday Night Classic Series, Harkins Bricktown is featuring classic holiday films every Tuesday in December at 7 p.m. for $5. The schedule includes National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation on Dec. 1, Elf on Dec. 8, A Christmas Story on Dec. 15, and The Polar Express on Dec. 22. 
Tinseltown USA, located across from Remington Park, is taking a more scattershot approach to holiday programming. Their eclectic slate includes The Nutcracker from the NYC Ballet on Dec. 5 & 10, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation on Dec. 6, It’s a Wonderful Life on Dec. 13, Miracle on 34th Street on Dec. 20, and the Doctor Who Christmas Special on Dec. 28. 
For the truly adventurous, Tinseltown is also screening RiffTrax Live: Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny on Dec. 3 & 15. RiffTraz is a company that releases hilariously terrible B movies accompanied by a running commentary from three comedians. I recently attended a live version of this concept at Will Rogers Theater where local comedians were paired with the Oklahoma made horror film Army of Frankenstein. Army is actually a good movie. But, listening to comedians make fun of everything on screen proved to be absolutely hysterical. It’s a high-risk activity, so only invite friends that are game for anything. And, don’t skimp on the wine beforehand. 
The Museum of Art typically provides great counter programming to the holiday faire around town. And, this year is no exception. During December, the Museum will offer a wide range of outstanding foreign films, classic American noir films, enticing documentaries and Japanese Anime from Master director Hayao Miyazaki. 
The film I am most excited to see at the Museum in December is Hitchcock/Truffaut, a documentary based on the 1962 interview between French New Wave filmmaker Francois Truffaut and American suspense master Alfred Hitchcock. This new film debuted at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and incorporates archival footage and interviews with modern filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson. Hitchcock/Truffaut screens at 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 17, 18, & 19, and at 2 p.m. on Dec. 20. 
The Museum is screening one unexpected holiday treat this Christmas. Jingle Bell Rocks! is a documentary about the search for the twelve best, underappreciated Christmas songs. Through interviews and live performances from luminaries such as Joseph “Rev Run” Simmons from RUN-D.M.C. and Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips, the film presents a compelling argument for expanding the established holiday cannon to include new and exciting songs from modern performers. 
Oh, in case you do not hear about it anywhere else, you may want to check out the new Star Wars movie starting Dec. 18. Have a great December.</div><div class="Read_more"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/christmas-movies-in-december-p10409-174.htm" class="Read_more_heading"><span class="Read_more_heading heading_174" style="display: block;">(more)</span></a> </div></div></div><div id="main_SEC_601"><div id="image_SEC_601"><a href="https://okcfriday.com/deadcenter-on-netflix-p10388-174.htm" ><img class="img_SCE_601"src="https://okcfriday.com/lib/images/blank.png"></a> </div><div class="body_SEC_wrap"><div id="heading_SEC_601"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/deadcenter-on-netflix-p10388-174.htm" class="heading_SCE_601 heading_174">deadCENTER on Netflix</a> </div><div id="date_SEC_601"><div class="IssueDate_SEC601 heading_174"><span class="layout_date"></span><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetArticleDate("11/27/2015");</script></div></div><div class="body_SEC_601">Happy Thanksgiving! For the past 15 years, Oklahoma’s deadCENTER Film Festival has lured the most exciting independent films from around the world to downtown Oklahoma City. Thanks to Cox On Demand, iTunes, Netflix and other digital distribution channels, many deadCENTER favorites can now be enjoyed in the comfort of your own home. Below is a short list of great international stories to entertain and inspire your family over this quintessentially American holiday. All of the films are currently streaming on Netflix. 
First up is The Trip to Italy, an uproarious road trip comedy following British comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as they travel around Italy enjoying the most amazing food in the world. The Trip started as a BBC television show with the same two comedians tasting and critiquing food across England. The show was a hit, so they produced a feature film in Italy as a sequel. The Trip to Italy sold out deadCENTER’s opening night in 2014 and remains one of our most popular films. 
Also from 2014, The Last Days of Vietnam premiered at Sundance, screened at deadCENTER, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The film tells the inspiring story of US soldiers and diplomats that set up unsanctioned rescue operations to save as many South Vietnamese lives as possible during the US evacuation from the Vietnam War. The Last Days of Vietnam was directed and produced by Rory Kennedy, daughter of Robert Kennedy, and associate produced by Edmond native Taylor Johns.
If your tastes veer towards melodrama, the Mexican film Gloria will blow you away. Produced and distributed by Oklahoma City’s Bob Berney, Gloria tells the story of Gloria Trevi, one of Mexico’s biggest pop stars whose spectacular rise to fame was ended by a shocking sex scandal that crashed her career and sent her to prison. Fortunately, she lived to tell and is currently back on top of the pop charts across South America. Gloria screened at deadCENTER in 2015 and is our most popular Spanish language film to date. 
For fans of scary movies, check out Troll Hunter, a Blair Witch style horror film from Norway about giant trolls. It sounds ridiculous, but is actually a great film and tons of fun. Troll Hunter was a surprise hit at Sundance and packed both of its screenings at deadCENTER in 2011. You will never think of trolls as little plastic toys after seeing this wintery thriller. 
Finally, for something more tropical, check out deadCENTER’s 2012 kick-off film Marley about Jamaican musician Bob Marley. Life magazine named Bob Marley the most important musician of the last century for introducing a new form of music, reggae, to a global audience. This definitive look at the singer’s life is surprisingly insightful considering the ubiquity of Marley’s music and image. The film is long at 144 minutes, but includes full live versions of several Bob Marley classics and can easily be watched in smaller installments. Prolific ganja use makes viewer discretion advisable. Enjoy the movies.</div><div class="Read_more"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/deadcenter-on-netflix-p10388-174.htm" class="Read_more_heading"><span class="Read_more_heading heading_174" style="display: block;">(more)</span></a> </div></div></div><div id="main_SEC_601"><div id="image_SEC_601"><a href="https://okcfriday.com/rocky-returns-for-thanksgiving-p10374-174.htm" ><img class="img_SCE_601"src="https://okcfriday.com/lib/images/blank.png"></a> </div><div class="body_SEC_wrap"><div id="heading_SEC_601"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/rocky-returns-for-thanksgiving-p10374-174.htm" class="heading_SCE_601 heading_174">Rocky returns for Thanksgiving</a> </div><div id="date_SEC_601"><div class="IssueDate_SEC601 heading_174"><span class="layout_date"></span><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetArticleDate("11/20/2015");</script></div></div><div class="body_SEC_601">The movies I remember most from my childhood are the ones that we watched together as a family. From "The Wizard of Oz" to "Star Wars," the films we experienced together became a larger part of our family discussions and ultimately endured as our shared history. This Thanksgiving, I highly recommend you go see a movie with your entire family. And, since everyone likes to be inspired, you should start with the return of an American icon: Rocky. 
That’s right; Rocky Balboa is back. The underdog boxer that scored Oscar gold in 1976 and fought his way through five movie sequels returns to theaters this Thanksgiving in the spin off movie, "Creed."
"Creed" is the story of Adonis Johnson, son of Rocky’s late friend and former rival Apollo Creed. It is the first film in the "Rocky" series not written by Sylvester Stallone and the first not to feature Stallone as a boxer. Instead, Stallone will play the trainer. At 69, Stallone is exactly the same age that Burgess Meredith was when he played Rocky’s trainer in the original "Rocky."
The original "Rocky" is the stuff of Hollywood legend. An unknown actor writes a script for himself to star in, gets turned down by everyone in town, finally gets a low budget green light, and ends up making the biggest movie of the year. In 1976, United Artist’s $1 million boxing movie scored $225 million at the global box office, ten Oscar nominations and three Oscar wins for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Editing. Stallone became a huge star. And, the series of six "Rocky" films went on to earn $1.27 billion at the global box office. &nbsp;
The latest installment, "Creed," is the brainchild of writer/director Ryan Coogler. Coogler is an Oakland native who had just finished film school at USC when he approached Stallone with the idea of extending the Rocky story to include Apollo’s son as a new lead character. Stallone was intrigued but not sold. So, Coogler moved in another direction, developing his first feature film, "Fruitvale Station."
"Fruitvale Station" tells the true story of a subway shooting where a policeman shot and killed a man lying on the ground in handcuffs. The controversial film was released at Sundance in January of 2013 to huge acclaim, taking home both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award in the Dramatic Competition. Coogler quickly became one of the hottest directors in town. When he called Stallone the second time about writing and developing "Creed," the answer was yes. 
To play the lead in "Creed," Coogler tapped his Fruitvale Station star Michael B. Jordan. Jordan started his career on "Cosby," followed by award winning work in "All My Children," "The Wire" and "Friday Night Lights." As the lead actor in "Fruitvale Station," Jordan won the National Board of Review’s Breakthrough Performance Award and was nominated for the Independent Spirit and MTV Movie Awards. 
With fresh Hollywood talent taking on a classic American story, "Creed" should be great fun for the entire family. But, no matter what you choose to watch or do with your family, have a fantastic Thanksgiving.</div><div class="Read_more"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/rocky-returns-for-thanksgiving-p10374-174.htm" class="Read_more_heading"><span class="Read_more_heading heading_174" style="display: block;">(more)</span></a> </div></div></div><div id="main_SEC_601"><div id="image_SEC_601"><a href="https://okcfriday.com/nd-annual-cine-latino-film-festival-p10350-174.htm" ><img class="img_SCE_601"src="https://okcfriday.com/lib/images/blank.png"></a> </div><div class="body_SEC_wrap"><div id="heading_SEC_601"> <a href="https://okcfriday.com/nd-annual-cine-latino-film-festival-p10350-174.htm" class="heading_SCE_601 heading_174">2nd Annual Cine Latino Film Festival</a> </div><div id="date_SEC_601"><div class="IssueDate_SEC601 heading_174"><span class="layout_date"></span><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetArticleDate("11/13/2015");</script></div></div><div class="body_SEC_601">The Cine Latino Film Festival returns to downtown Oklahoma City this Friday and Saturday, November 13 and 14. Cine Latino is Oklahoma’s only Spanish language, Latino themed film festival. The two-day festival includes free children’s films, panel discussions on making movies, filmmaker Q&A’s, live music, and great films from Oklahoma, Texas, Mexico and beyond. 
The Cine Latino festival was launched last year as a co-production between the deadCENTER Film Festival, Tango PR and the Capital Hill Chamber of Commerce. deadCENTER had completed a statewide festival tour and was looking for a way to engage the thriving Latino community in south Oklahoma City. Historic Capitol Hill was hoping to expand its wildly popular Fiestas de las Americas to include film. Tango PR brought the two groups together and Cine Latino was born. 
Local filmmaker and deadCENTER alum Rogelio Almeida is leading the charge for Cine Latino for the second year in a row. Almeida is a graduate of Oklahoma City Community College and an award winning filmmaker who won Best Oklahoma Film at deadCENTER in 2009 for his film Yvette. Yvette was the first Spanish language film to win an award at deadCENTER. 
Almeida is now a Multimedia Specialist at the University of Central Oklahoma and co-owner of Almeida Films with his wife, Nora Almeida. Nora wrote the screenplay for Yvette and works full time at UCO as a Project Manager, helping Spanish speaking students and faculty integrate into the fabric of the university.
Thanks to great partnerships with UCO and OCCC and a major sponsorship from Fowler Dodge, Cine Latino has expanded this year to include both the Boathouse District and Historic Capitol Hill. 
The gorgeous new CHK/Central Boathouse will host the VIP Opening Night Gala starting at 6 p.m. on Friday. Tickets are $30 and include a reception, short films from local filmmakers Melissa Sue Lopez and Victor Caballero, the Oklahoma Premiere of “La Castracion,” a discussion with the film’s Mexico based director Ivan Lowenberg, and an after party featuring the music of Oklahoma Spanish rock sensation CU4TRO. 
On Saturday, Cine Latino returns to Historic Capitol Hill for a full day of free screenings and events at Oklahoma City Community College’s Capitol Hill Center. “Familia Fest” starts at 12 p.m., featuring films for children ages 3-12. The Short Film and Documentary Competition will run from 1 - 3 p.m., followed by a Filmmaker Q&A. At 4 p.m., Cine Latino will present a collection of short films from the Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia en Corto. The final screening at 5:30 p.m. will be the PBS Documentary Latino Americans: The New Latinos, followed by a Panel Discussion with local Latino leaders and an Awards Presentation for the entire festival. 
Last year, Cine Latino attracted hundreds of families, artists, musicians and local filmmakers sharing their films in Oklahoma for the first time.
