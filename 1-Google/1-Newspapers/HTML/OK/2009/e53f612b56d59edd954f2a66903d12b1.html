<div class="pageheading">We call it �husband management.'</div><div class="pagebody">Making an interior designer decision as �woman of the house,� Gennie Johnson advertised and sold the dining room table. Hubby Bob, off doing �manly guy business,� didn�t notice until he walked through the room and asked, �Where�s the dining room table?�</div><div class="pagebody">�I sold it,� reported Gennie. �You what?� an unsettled Bob questioned. �I sold it because I think we can find a better size� was her emphatic answer. Bob went off grumbling something about an uppity woman and mumbled over something else about his rights. Obviously, Gennie, a talented artist, had something more fitting in mind, and she shortly moved in a perfect replacement table.</div><div class="pagebody">A few days later the house across the street went on the market. Gennie-the-little-dickens just could not resist. She asked the home owner if she could borrow the sign for just a few hours until Bob came home from work. She stuck it in her lawn and just waited for Bob ... </div><div class="pagebody">That�s how we train husbands and keep them guessing.</div><div class="pagebody">�Early summer is often the time for high school class reunions, and this year both my husband and I are having a big one. Yup, you�re sharp. We�re celebrating our 100th high school class reunion. Oh, zip it!</div><div class="pagebody">A very active bunch, his Harding group has been working on his reunion for about two years, mine is Edmond High School, and I�d like to think we�re so organized it just doesn�t take us as long -- we�ve been working on it about 3 months. But all the elements are in place for both. At my last meeting, after the business was accomplished, we figured we were old enough to finally �tell on ourselves.� That brought out all sorts of formerly buried secrets. Wearing my permanent halo, I had nothing to confess. In actuality, it was such an innocent time, our antics were pathetically mild.</div><div class="pagebody">But a �nameless� lady (Anne) beside me finally �fessed up. This sweet and lovely woman has never even said anything more wicked than, �My shaw!� I asked her if she�d even done anything wrong. I can tell you all the teachers adored her as she was the perfect student. She mentioned a rotund lady teacher who had a pronounced mustache, who we�ll merely refer to as �Mrs. M.�  For some reason, �Mrs. M� wasn�t nice to Anne. Anne admitted she�d finally gotten even by doing something, (gasp) evil.</div><div class="pagebody">About five times a day, Mrs. M bestowed the favor of �letting a student� get her a coke, and she promptly dropped two aspirin into it. It was just a ritual -- we think it was a 60s way of getting high. Anne, fed up with being picked on, got the coke, drank half of it, and filled the rest with water. That�s it! That�s the most horrid thing she ever did! We did live a Beaver Cleaver existence, and it is hilarious that Anne is still carrying around guilt. </div><div class="pagebody">Writing of high school reunions, John Marshall is holding a 40th reunion for the class of 1969 at the Waterford Marriott on June 26 and 27.</div><div class="pagebody">�Now writing of 100 year anniversaries -- please tell me you didn�t believe it is my 100th high school reunion � but OKLAHOMA ELECTRICAL SUPPLY COMPANY is celebrating its 100th. The observations will be in OKC and then the following weekend in Tulsa. This is truly a company born in Oklahoma. OESCO is the oldest electrical contractor in the state in which the family is still active. Steve Young�s grandfather (on his mother�s side of the family) Zenie Hirsch, started the company in 1909, but he�d passed on before Steve was born, and Steve is the only relative still active in the company.</div><div class="pagebody">Being a family member brought no early privileges, as Steve started working summers in the warehouse at age 14. He later graduated from SMU and worked in the company full time for some 36 years. Steve has been president for 15 years. He said that his grandfather came to OKC two years after statehood, and there weren�t many things that were powered by electricity, so being in the first class having been bestowed an Electrical Engineering Degree from Purdue University, was quite unusual. </div><div class="pagebody">OESCO holds Oklahoma State Electrical Contractor�s license No. 1! Electrical contracting has always been the main activity of the company, though it has not sold electrical goods for more than 50 years, but that kind of longevity makes the name stick. It now performs commercial and industrial electrical construction work, specializing in healthcare facilities, detention facilities, gaming facilities, data centers, commercial, institutional and industrial facilities and service work. One division, �INFOSYS� performs advanced technology work including teledata and fiber optic cabling -- and all sorts of stuff I don�t understand -- across the US.</div><div class="pagebody">Interestingly, several OESCO employees have left to start their own businesses -- one being Lillian Strickler, an early pioneer business woman. She managed OESCO�s light fixture department before opening her own store on 23rd street in the early 1950�s. Happy One Hundredth Birthday to OESCO.</div><div class="pagebody">�Hosting a couples shower for Megan Edwards who will marry Andy Bauml are Sara and Rob Northwood, Janie and Jon Axton, Kirk and Royce Hammons and Nancy and Larry Herzel. The party, held in the Northwoods� home, had about 60 people attending, and among them were Paige Edwards Frenzel who is the bride�s sister, Patsy Carey, Susie and Tom Gray, Gennie and Bob Johnson, Jeary and Mike Seikel, Barbara and Jay Quillian, Eve and Bill Patterson, Lucinda and David Huffman, Susan Porter, Mary and J. Robert Reneau, and Kathleen and Tim O�Toole. </div><div class="pagebody">Whitney Cross and Jordan Young prepared a creative menu of assorted �tapas� set among vibrant arrangements of tulips, lilies, and hydrangea. Susan and Carl Edwards are parents of the bride, and the groom is the son of Binnie and Louis Bauml, of Houston. An August wedding is planned in Colorado Springs.</div><div class="pagebody">�Several columns ago I wrote of the many Orchestra League projects, and one was the Music Olympics. Jessica Fellows, a violinist, was the overall winner of the competitions, and Joel Levine selected her to be a soloist with the Philharmonic in their Side by Side Concert. The process here is that the student performer sits by a regular Philharmonic player and plays the same music. </div><div class="pagebody">This year�s Buttram competition winners were Jessica Fellows, Violin/Overall; and Michael Jones, Viola; Lisa Storm, Cello; Brendan Bradford, Bass. String Quartet winners: Wenjia Xu, Violin 1; Lucy Bates, Violin 2; Michael Jones, Viola; and Scott Bennett, Cello.</div><div class="pagebody">Carver Competition: Cory Johnson, Brass/Overall; and Holly Gaines, Woodwinds. The Keith Competition: Sarah Blair, Violin, Overall; Lydia Bradford, Viola; Claire Vick, Cello; and Faith Bercier, Bass. The Meinders Competion awarded Michael Stafford, First Place; Chris Powell, Second Place; and Chebon Ryan, Meinders Junior. </div><div class="pagebody">The Buttram Competition had 3 String Quartets and 23 solo entrants, the Carver Competition numbered 5. The Keith Competition had 17 young string players and there were 3 entrants in the Meinders Piano Competition. What a fabulous opportunity for our young musicians, made possible by the generous benefactors and the hard work on the part of the Orchestra League.</div><div class="pagebody">	</div><div class="pagebody">TRAVEL TIP</div><div class="pagebody">Be sure to take your hand sanitizer if you fly, go by train or bus. Until you thoroughly clean your hands, don�t touch your eyes, mouth or nose. Available are teeny bottle of sanitizer, or there are foil-wrapped wipes.</div><div class="pageruler"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 0pt;">&nbsp;</span></div><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetSubMenuFooter79();</script></div>
