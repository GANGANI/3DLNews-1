Friday Foto by Joy Richardson</div></div></td></tr></table>Spies, murder and mayhem --think that�s the domain of the bad guys? Ninety-six-year-old Mozelle Richardson doesn�t see it that way! Her ninth published book is a fast-paced spy thriller starting with the theft of a skull from the prisoner of war cemetery in El Reno, OKLAHOMA -- and catapults you to Bavaria, involving the CIA, KGB, and Israeli Mossad. An autographed copy of THE THYSSEN AFFAIR would be a great gift ***CHRISTMAS TIP***, as Mozelle will be signing books at Full Circle Book Store on Thursday, Dec.17 � 5-7 p.m. Well-known in Oklahoma City, she now lives in Santa Fe and dreams up fiendish and diabolical plots about which to write -- and, silly you, you seriously thought seniors just rock and knit!</div><div class="pagebody">�Oops, you caught me with the hind quarters of a white buffalo in my mouth. (That�s not a line I�ve used before) Sue Ann Hyde, buying a set of cookie cutters in Yellowstone this summer, was preparing for a Russell Center party at the University of Oklahoma -- this girl thinks ahead! Working with Ruth�s Sweet Justice, she oversaw the creation of white buffalo cookies. �Nah, might need glitter on his tail, no, needs brown hooves, oops, the leg broke,� was her patter as she sampled her way through the not-quite-flawless buffalo cookies. Said she was pretty full by the time she�d perfected them!</div><div class="pagebody">The Charles Marion Russell Center was at one time the Faculty Club at OU. Above our heads toward the soaring ceiling is an internal balcony where bands played during dances. The building is charming as something from 1925 would be, and beside the pretty fireplace was Andy Wilkinson entertaining us with cowboy folk songs. A burly buffalo head on the mantle was festively dressed for Christmas. We were fortunate enough to see the beautiful books that are the University of Oklahoma�s latest projects. This is also a ***CHRISTMAS TIP*** as one of these magnificently illustrated books would be a great gift for anyone, and especially a proud Oklahoman. Website: OUpress.com</div><div class="pagebody">Among those enjoying the afternoon event were Millicent and Bob Sukman, Linda and Jim Lowe, Susan and Peter Hoffman, Nancy and Bill Ford, Janie and Jon Axton, Katie and Jim Davis, and Dudley Hyde. Did you know that OU has the only PhD program in the country in �Art in the American West�?</div><div class="pagebody">�The Presbyterian Health Foundation, Oklahoma Health Center foundation, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center held a holiday celebration at OKC Golf and Country Club. Kay Goebel introduced me to Ken Ferguson who was honored as a member of the Hall of Fame. Ken serves on THIRTY boards. Ken�s wife Mary is famous for a great line. �It�s a good thing you�re not a girl -- you just can�t say NO!� </div><div class="pagebody">The food and stunning tree just made it all Christmassy. Enjoying the evening were Penny Voss who is VP of Development for OU Health Sciences Center, Judge Jerome Holmes, Katie and Will Merrick, Ann and John Taylor, Bill Pirtle and his fianc�e, Beverly Brown, Dana and David Russell, Marnie and Clayton Taylor, Laura Warriner, Jean and Larkin Warner, and Rex Urice. Others were Nancy and Tim Leonard, Tina and Bruce Day, Barbara Crandall, Kyle Hanser, Susan and Carl Edwards, Lolly and Mike Anderson, Ann Ackerman and Hershal Lamirand, Judy Newkirk, and Jane and Gerald Gamble.</div><div class="pagebody">�Friends and associates were invited to Robertson & Williams and Financial Risk Solutions� new offices in the Colonnade Court, and offered cocktails and hors d�oeuvres while touring the pretty space. Talking about holiday �stuff� were Rawsie and Sonny Boyles, Deloris and Dennis Bradford, Robert Hefner and son Robert, and Susan Robertson.</div><div class="pagebody">�The art galleries were all holiday-ed up and art lovers came out to see what was new. At the Howell Gallery, I didn�t want to miss my dear friend Gennie Johnson�s work, and it looked captivating with light flooding it perfectly. Roaming around there I saw Judy Love, Kirk Hammons, Lori and Dodge Hill, Carol and Sam Gann. At the Dodson�s Gallery also many of your friends are showing, among them Arden Barrett, Janie Kimball, Peggy Lunde, Linda Coats, SoRelle Fitzgerald, Pat Edwards, Betty Crow, Debbie McCord, and Sharon Bozalis -- really beautiful art.	</div><div class="pagebody">Among the crowd there were Suzanne Silvester, Jody Kerr, Jean Dale, Mary Reneau, Carolyn Sandusky Williams, Lexy and Huston Huffman. </div><div class="pagebody">�Mercy Hospital knows �gala.� Planning of such a huge event is momentous. Reasoning that most people would be dressed in formal wear, which is predominantly black, party planners used silver lame tablecloths for contrast. Smart! New Leaf created seven different centerpiece designs which were glamorous, flirty, glittering and festive; the effect was of different tables everywhere. </div><div class="pagebody">Patty Ruffin and Suzy Merritt made the auction just outstanding, bet their husbands, Rick, and Paul, didn�t get a home-cooked meal for months, as it was a gigantic endeavor. It was divided into �Gents Section�: fun stuff like �man-cave refreshment bucket,� Goodies Galore: like a handsome handcrafted bowl made from 15 types of wood from Mercy�s own Dr. Tim Grode; Glam Auction, Santa Fe trip for four nights; Gliz Auction, cape of cashmere with a luxurious mink and fox hood.</div><div class="pagebody">Surveying the items were Vickie and John Vance, Sherry and Larry Howell, Linda and Billy Neimann, Carrie and Ryan Leonard, Kelly and Chuck Mirabile, Patti and Don Rahhal, Terry and John Stanley, Bebe and Bruce MacKellar, Lynette and Clark Hyde, Cathy and Kirk Leichter, Jeri and Mike Reif, and Sarah and Robert Wieneke.</div><div class="pagebody">Executive Director of the Mercy Foundation Kay Oliver welcomed guests with brief opening remarks, eloquent and charming as we all know her to be. Seated at the splendid tables were co-chairmen of the event Kay Murcer and Mary England, others: Karen and Jim Gebhart, Veronica and J.A. Montero, Pat and Jim Dixson, Tammy Drum and Mark Southerland, Gates Oliver, Janie and Bob Shea, Linda and Tom Fanning, Gary England, Kathy and Hal Brown, Susan Drake, Mary Kay Samis, Billye and Jimmie Austin, Di and Ted Smalley, Diana and Gabe Pardo, Charlotte and Joe Andrezek, Roseland and Richard Cooke, and Jeannette and Dick Sias.</div><div class="pagebody">Going back to check on auction items were Sara and Kyle Sweet, Lori and Carter Johnston, Mary Sotor, and CEO of Mercy Health Systems Lynn Britton, and his pretty wife, Thriess, who live in St. Louis. Also Dee and Dick Dugan, Jenne and Curt Knudsen, Cindy and Calvin Worth, Nancy and Bob Smith, Kathy and Larry Lawrence, Lynn and Ron White, Gennie and Bob Johnson, Jan and Richard Smith, Jennifer and David Oliver, Sylvia and Robert Slater, Chelin and Gregg Satherlie, Toby and Phil Walker, Carol and Steve Solomon, Terry and Hank Bradley, and Jane and Jim White.</div><div class="pagebody">As we were retrieving our coats, we chatted with Barbara Thorton and Niles Jackson. I told him that Niles was also my father�s name, and I didn�t hear it very often. His eyes twinkled up and he told me, �I have a Beanie Baby camel � given to me because its name is Niles.� Didn�t expect that funny tidbit from a judge!<br><br><div class="sharebody"><a class="addthis_button"><img src="/images/at-share.gif" title="bulletlink.com - Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"></a></div><br><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetAddThis();</script></div><div class="pageruler"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 0pt;">&nbsp;</span></div><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetSubMenuFooter79();</script></div>
