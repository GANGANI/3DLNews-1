<div>And you wonder why Tom and Brenda McDaniel are the darlings of our city! They recently celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. The plan was a train trip and long weekend with their children and grandchildren, AND a cruise for just the two of them. A not-delightful change popped up. Tom, president of Oklahoma City University, is spending seven-eight weeks at MD Anderson going through radiation treatment for prostate cancer, so it was necessary to cancel the festivities. <BR>But you don’t keep the McDaniels down long! Typically them, they just readjusted. Dropping by a neighborhood Methodist church in Houston, they were greeted by the pastor. In passing, it was mentioned that they were celebrating this 50th milestone. Thinking this was so cool; the minister asked if they’d like to renew their vows. So the McDaniels repeated the promises they’d made 50 years ago, and as Tom said, “She STILL said YES!” <BR>Using Tom’s treatment time well, they’d planned two trips back to OKC, but found themselves alone on their anniversary. However, son Mark called to say he’d be in Houston for business and could have dinner with them. <BR>This is where the love pours in -- actually Judy and Tom LOVE. Well, long, long before this, the Loves were arranging this surprise trip to Houston. They were so afraid someone might “slip” that they hadn’t even told the members of the surprise until Tom and Brenda made their temporary move to Houston.	<BR>The Loves, the McDaniel’s son Mark and wife Stacy, Randy and wife Julie, had flown down in Tom Love’s plane, and were happily settled in rooms at Hotel Zaza which is just four blocks from the condo the McDaniels are renting. Brenda and Tom picked up Mark from his meeting. Entering the hotel and seeing their children, presents, and being part of family pictures was a total shock to the anniversary couple. They were still gasping when, during dinner on the Zaza terrace, son Lance called to give his love, but he was working on a movie and couldn’t leave. Judy Love said, “I have never seen any people so totally blown away by surprise, and so happy about it!”<BR>This was a Friday, and the adult kids were able to have breakfast with Brenda and Tom the next morning. The grandchildren had basketball tournaments, so the parents had to scurry home. But the warm glow will last forever, what had seemed so bleak turned into a memorable celebration. But it’s also about love, friendship, and great attitude which the McDaniels have in abundance.<BR>Brenda McDaniel always gives you the hilarious inside stories, and ‘being with Tom 24/7’ is a new experience for them both. All their married life, they’ve been working, volunteering, taking care of others. To sum it up, Tom is not familiar with grocery shopping or laundry -- other than eating and creating laundry. Staying in a condo while going through treatments has given President McDaniel a primer in “homemaker 101”. A laughing Brenda says he’s amazed by the prices in grocery stores and is always making her put stuff back on the shelf, saying, “Brenda, we’ll never eat all that!” And the washer and dryer -- suffice it to say that a man as brilliant as Tom just shouldn’t find “pre-soak,” “energy-preferred”, and “fluff” such a mystery.<BR>But with their ‘joie de vivre,’ they’ll enjoy another 50 years, and Tom is now trained to be a “wife.” <BR>•If you’ve always wanted to travel with an expert, Jamie Davis who owns Jamie’s in Casady Square, is leading a “Flavors of Tuscany Tour” starting Oct. 3. Hosted by Abercrombie & Kent, there will be cooking classes with Jamie who has visited her sister in Lucca, Italy many times over the years. There will be a private tour of one of the oldest Tuscan pasta makers, a visit with a “Chocolatier” in Florence and wine tastings. It’ll be a pretty time of the year and you’ll have a knowledgeable guide, call 463-5811for more information.<BR>•Last fall during a cruise on the Devon boat down the Oklahoma River, Larkin Warner asked Kay Musser to introduce him when he accepted the award, Phi Beta Kappa of the Year. They’ve mutual respect as Kay was president-elect of Phi Beta Kappa when Larkin was president. They’ve served on the Executive Committee for several years. I can see why Larkin picked Kay, she’s not only intuitive, astute, and quick-witted -- but vivacious and pretty on top of it. Not fair for all that to be in one person!<BR>Kay said, “Larkin made it clear that he asked me to make the introduction because he knew I’d be brief and informal.” Larkin is a very modest gentleman. What Larkin knows about Kay is that she is also fun! In formulating her intro, she kept commenting to her husband, Clark, that everyone wants Larkin. With that germ of an idea, Kay went forth. <BR>During the ceremony, she carried a high-powered flashlight, and appeared to be searching him out in the crowd, saying, “Larkin is a ‘Wanted Man’.” Kay began with, “He was wanted by the parents to whom he was born during the depths of the Great Depression.” (His father’s life as a PhD college professor was an inspiration to Larkin).<BR>He was wanted by Phi Beta Kappa as a junior at Ohio Wesleyan with a double major in history and economics. Kay’s continuity with wanted chronicled his professorships, Kerr Foundation, OSU teaching, research, and public service work, MAPS for Kids initiative, Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame induction, and with her sensitivity, she concluded, “To know Larkin is to know a gentle man who has a passion for knowledge and is curious about how current events fit into the lessons of history. He’s open-minded in his studies and eager to be fascinated by what he discovers!” Please join me in honoring Dr. Larkin Warner. . <BR>To those of you who are NOT members of Phi Beta Kappa (she, the columnist, wrote loftily), you’ve not seen me skipping down the sidewalk swinging my PBK key, either! But I so respect the scholarships they give, and what they represent. Kay said she knew she wanted to keep the presentation light as there were high school seniors sitting there, and she wanted to show the group as fun-loving, and not just a bunch of folks that list Phi Beta Kappa on their resumes! <BR>Just so we, who don’t have this designation, know a bit of the history: Phi Beta Kappa Society was founded in 1776 at William and Mary, has 276 chapters, and half a million living members. It is the most prestigious college honor in the US, and membership is the highest undergraduate honor given to Liberal Arts and Science graduates.<BR>We can all be proud of that Larkin lives among us, he is so reticent to seek the limelight that he may hide for a week after this comes out! But Larkin is good-natured -- even wife, Jean will agree. And he is such a fine ambassador for Phi Beta Kappa.</div>
