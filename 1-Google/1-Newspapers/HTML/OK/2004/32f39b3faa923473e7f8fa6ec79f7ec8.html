<div>Telling Kay and Harry Goebel’s three pretty blonde daughters apart always throws me. Karen Goebel Keith told me that I’m not alone, and that Rick Vermillion was pretty sure he had it down cold at the Arts Festival. (Those Goebel folks are ALWAYS volunteering to staff, lead, chair and work -- whatever’s needed). Anyway, the three daughters, Kristi Oliver, Kathi Goebel and Karen Keith, at the last Festival tormented him by switching nametags and threw Rick into a real tizzy!<BR>Karen and her husband Jim Keith threw a wonderful birthday/bedlam football watch party for Kay’s 29th  birthday -- they TOLD me it was her 29th. Among the guests were Jackie Jones, Liz Eickman, Sherron and Allen Evans, Angela and Mike Bachman, Kathy and Tom Stewart, and Beth and Jim Tolbert. As Beth and Jim were leaving about halftime, they offered this apology, “Some author thinks that 2 p.m. in the middle of the OU/OSU game is a wonderful time to have a book signing!” They were off to Full Circle Book Store.<BR>The Goebel girls are known for their cooking, so the chili and fat juicy hot dogs, green chili stew, all the fixings and dips were just fantastic. I even came away with a recipe for the best salsa I’ve eaten and if you’re really nice to me, I just might share. <BR>Karen and Jim recently moved into a really beautiful new home. We were told that Jim built the astonishing entertainment center, bookshelves and fireplace mantle. Of gleaming wood, they are massive, perfectly crafted and so sophisticated and elegant. In talking to him, we mentioned the exquisite finish. He said, “After crafting them, I lovingly sanded them to perfection and took them to “Manzo” to stain and finish. I wanted a slightly distressed finish. Asking one of the craftsmen how they would accomplish that, I totally blanched when he replied that they beat it with chains and a machete too!” <BR>Kay, admonishing us all to “just bring cards,” seemed to have a wonderful time at her celebration, their son Bart was there and she was surprised by son Dee Goebel just dropping in from Midland, Texas.<BR>Kathi was the only OSU fan and everyone left her isolated in a bedroom with her own TV, when OSU pulled ahead, she ventured out with a big grin on her face, but we marched her right back into her prison. Abby, a German Shorthair, was festive with her Halloween scarf and kept us all safe by going outside to check on those pesky squirrels.<BR>•Marilyn and Jim Case gathered friends together to watch the game also. Nestled near Marilyn’s big pot of tortilla soup was a ceramic figure of an OU player stirring a cauldron with Pistol Pete cooking in it. <BR>Those screaming and coaching were Patti and Dick Marshall (he won the third quarter “game ball” prize), Bev and David Carter (Bev won the first quarter OU necklace, and had on the cutest diamond and ruby -- real? I think not -- OU earrings that we all covet), Patty and Roland Tague, Rick Ernest, Barbara Mee, Ellen and Kent Williams, Patty and Charlie Lutz, Lori and Dodge Hill, and Bette Jo and Frank Hill.<BR>Second quarter winner was Mary Anne Malone and she went home with a bottle opener that played Boomer Sooner, but David Carter went home with the big pot into which we’d all pitched dollars. There were televisions and radios EVERYWHERE, and as things got tense, we all got up and stalked around trying to stir up luck. Let me tell you, some of those women were so verbal, they scared me!	<BR>•Earlier that week, to our delight, Toby Walker let us celebrate her 50th birthday, and we were invited to Darlene Parman’s beautiful and restful Scottsdale home to do so. Joan Thomas, who lives in Scottsdale, joined us for dinner one day.	<BR>Some of the random comments were so wacky. On the plane flight to Phoenix, those zany Southwest pilots never fail to amuse us. Ours, in a grave voice intoned, “We’re expecting some unexpected turbulence.”<BR>Another time, discussing how we lived through those blissful days of not knowing the dangers of asbestos, no seat belts and that artificial sweetener saccarine, etc. Toby said, “Why, I always drank Tab because I was Toby Ann Brown and those were my initials!” How Valley Girl!<BR>My personal contribution to the trip was my travel “white noise machine” which blocks out little sounds at night. I was explaining the menu of sounds from which I could choose; there is the babbling brook, summer cricket and frog sounds, waterfall, rain, and the haunting bell sound of a buoy. Beth Hammack didn’t track that one. The next day after puzzling all night, she asked, “Joy, WHY would you want a boy ringing a bell?” “BUOY, Beth, BUOY.”<BR>Toby was recounting a conversation in which a friend said she was going home to feed her toy poodle. Another friend, in all innocence, said; “Now what on earth would you feed a toy poodle?”<BR>One girl awakened to snoring. She later said, “My husband tries to tell me I snore. Oh dear! Am I snoring? Listening, I thought, wait a minute, I’m awake, so it must not be ME snoring.” We’re pretty sure it wasn’t Dianne Meacham, Trish O’Hara or Cheryl Hewett, but we never did solve that one.<BR>Waltzing down the corridor at the airport for our return, we saw a pretty blonde carrying a sheepherder’s staff with a hook covered in bows. Other than 21st century pink stretch pants, she looked just like Little Bo Peep. No, no sheep -- what do you suppose that was all about? Toby thoroughly enjoyed her birthday, being surrounded by “girlfriends” and constant laughter.<BR>•We’re very proud of Jerry’s mom, Mozelle Richardson, who has been certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest person to get an under-graduate degree! She was 90 years old. It’s not certain that she’ll be included in the book, but she has that designation and a proclamation to confirm that.<BR>•You’ll be really mad at yourself if you miss the second annual Designer Inventory Sale, held by the Oklahoma City Orchestra League. And it’s going on right now -- this weekend. This is their fall fundraiser and participants include many of the metro’s finest interior and exterior designers who will be offering an exciting array of furniture, antiques, accessories and fabrics at HUGE savings to you!<BR>The Preview Party was set for Thursday, 7-9 p.m., at 1433 Northwest Expressway, and the sale goes from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday in that location. Proceeds are used to support the Orchestra League’s many music education programs in the public schools and community. For more information, call Jean McCown 285-5015, or Karen Vollbrecht 341-8632.<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>Tricia Morton pointed out a “Chapel” sign in the Phoenix airport, and said she often sees them and she has stopped in. She said they are quiet, serene, and have a book in which people write down their thoughts: “Please let me have a safe flight” or “Pray for my father.” In this rush-rush world, I find that a comforting and spiritual idea.<BR></div>
