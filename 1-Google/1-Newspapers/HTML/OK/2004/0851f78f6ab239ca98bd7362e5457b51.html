    <meta itemprop="description" content="A Level Playing FieldBy Jaron Williams'Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' -George Santayana-Bryan-I agree that people need to stop with the 'Where is white history month?' and it is also shameful that the University's Young Republicans decided to have a scholarship that is for 'white kids only.' In this day and age, that is unbelievable. Free speech is one thing but to make a mockery of it is another. How about they try a white male, whose family came over on the Mayflower, owned a plantation and slaves, gave up 40 acres and a mule after Emancipation and now currently claims to be an upstanding individual who isn't a racist because he 'knows a black dude?; Perhaps they will. The only problem I have with this article is the amount of clichs used. Clichs are also a 'thing of the past' along with racism. Keep writing because it definitely evokes emotion, and that is what literature needs to do. Thank you, Jaron.-Dubb-I completely agree with the overall message of your article. Black history month needs more respect, Black history needs more recognition in our history books and in our culture. I am a staunch supporter of human rights, and thus of minority rights and womens rights. However, your tone and approach in your article to these issues concerns me. Calling people whom you think are ignorant does nothing except maybe diminish your integrity. Referring to white people as ole boss borders on racism. I am excited to see an African-American writer on SIN bringing social injustices and African-American rights into a condition of visibility. However, if in doing this you create more division between races, pitting one against the other, you will be counter-productive and achieve very little. OU is extremely segregated, just look at our fraternity system. The last thing we need is more division. -Patrick-If people are so quick to jump at the fact that racism is still present in our country, maybe we should look at why. I don't think any particular race should have a specific month in which everyone should recognize their history. To help put a stop to racism, people of all races should appreciate each other for what they have to offer...something that is not just skin deep.-Jessica-Your article on Black History Month showed the importance of this often-criticized acknowledgement of American cultural richness. White guilt over past and present oppression is useless baggage, and does not solve anything; if more of us whites can dump some of this baggage, maybe the quotes that start off your essay will stop replaying themselves endlessly in our heads when we look for ways to improve interactions between ourselves and people not like us. Whatever else Black History Month may be, as you yourself point out, it should not be an excuse to renew old and useless patterns of whining defensiveness and resistance to cultural change.-Daniel-Abercrombie Makes Religion Cool AgainBy Mark PottsI could very easily say some offending words to you, but I would only be stooping down to your childish level. The Bible is not something to promote sales of an item. It is to bring people to salvation. Maybe instead of tearing and burning the pages you ought to start reading them. Do some soul searching!!!OK, listen carefully now. Every article on Slant, the portion of our site where you found this article, is not serious. Mark was not suggesting that Abercrombie sell bibles. He was actually making fun of Abercrombies ruthless marketing attempts. I suggest you actually read an article before writing an angry response. This guy is a real straight shooter with upper-level management written all over him. His social commentary doesnt come across as too preachy. It just makes you think. I like it. Give him a raise -- he is a great writer with lots of good points.-Don- A raise, it is. More pizza coupons and free movie passes will definitely be coming his way. Now that I have stopped laughing I can type this comment. If this actually were to happen, I wouldn't be too surprised. All the people in America striving to be popular will waste, I mean spend, all of daddy's money to be in the 'group' with everybody else that looks exactly like them. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who views preworn cloths as a retarded idea. Yes I have some cloths that look like the Abercrombie stuff but after years of use of those jeans, which only cost me $40-50, they look identical to the jeans that people with too much money and too little intelligence pay $80-$100 for. Now its time to get off my soap box and go off to class with my non-Abercrombie cloths.-Shelby- Bands You're Not Listening To: Super Furry AnimalsBy Mark PottsI just wanted to agree with you that this band is really great. I saw them this summer in Spain, they put on the best performance out of all the bands that were at this show. I was very impressed. It is hard to find their older albums here. Thanks for giving this band the credit they deserve.-Roxanne-Dude, I have been listening to Super Furry Animals for three years now. They rock. I think my favorite song is Golden Retriever. Your article was very good. Keep writing.-Ross- Breaking up Is Hard to DoBy Andrew TowerVery nicely written, I agree as well.-Vickie- Candy Hearts &amp; Ex-LaxBy Leah HoffmanFour words for you Leah: What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I rest my case.-Amanda-I think Leo is not all that bad. I have a new found respect for him due to the movie Gangs of New York. He was hardcore in that movie and not the whiney baby he was in Titanic. And have you ever seen Romeo and Juliet? He was a mean pimp who took out Tybalt without blinking. Plus he got with the FINE Ms. Claire Danes. Enough said.-Jrod-David Hasselhoff was on Baywatch and his chest is hairy. Not as hairy as when he was on Knight Rider, but I think that is a whole different article. -Laura- I dont know whether to be impressed or frightened by your vigilance of Hasselhoffs hirsute body. Fresh AirBy Danny MarroquinDanny was a very smart addition to the SIN family.-Bobbie We agree, and thank you. Gay Marriage?By Holly ReasonThis is to all those close-minded bigots out there who hide behind Holy Scripture to justify their hatred. Have you actually read the Bible thoroughly? Have you taken into account that, over the centuries, it has been translated and interpreted by those wishing to portray their already established prejudices? I have done extensive research on this, and if you look at the original Hebrew Scriptures, you will find that nowhere in the Bible does it condemn a monogamous, same-sex relationship between two consenting adults. The direct references to homosexuality refer to general sins such as orgies or rape, not a loving relationship between adults.To the person who claimed that being gay is a choice: are you gay? Do you know what it's like to live in a world where everyone says you are wrong and are going to burn for your sins? Do you know what it's like to fear for your safety and well-being every day because what you believe is different from someone else's views, and therefore wrong? If not, then I would suggest you not use that argument anymore. Why would anyone choose to live a life like that? I doubt someone's intrinsic desire to be different is so great that they would daily threaten their own lives. Whats more, biological and psychological studies have found evidence that homosexuality is a natural human occurrence. Rare, yes, but nonetheless natural. Furthermore, this country can no longer afford to base its laws solely on the morality of the Christian belief. There are too many differing viewpoints in this country to do so. One must encourage the equality and freedom for ALL citizens, even if there are those that would oppose it. Discrimination is discrimination, and should not be tolerated on any level.To the man who stated the article was garbage and should not be on the site: it is her opinion, in the opinion section. She was a right to post it there, just as you do. To the person who argued that marriage is a holy union: gays are not fighting for any religious acceptance, but for recognition from our supposedly impartial government whose job it is to protect equality for ALL. The issue of morality is best left to those involved personally, not to the intolerant masses.-Chris-Thank you.'Speaking of Christian morals, it is my understanding that the Christian religion also teaches not to judge other people. Who are Oklahomans and Americans to judge whether or not gay and lesbian people are making moral or immoral decisions?'The author's understanding is wrong and is a fundamental misconception about the Christian beliefs. We are taught not to judge a person but to judge their actions - i.e., I would never say, 'You're a bad person and are going to Hell. I would, however, as God tells us to, say that a certain behavior is sinful and that you should turn away from it.Please don't attempt to use generalities to imply something other than what God teaches us. There IS a difference between judging a person and judging that person's behavior.-Ana-Homosexuality is a choice. People do have a tendency towards one sex over the other, but it is comparable to alcoholism through genetics as opposed to the color of one's skin.Science continues to hold onto the paradigm of 'the survival of the fittest.' Now that homosexuals have been voicing their opinions, science has decided that homosexuality is not a choice. Science concludes that any inferior members of a race are naturally rid of or changed through evolution. I equate homosexuals to inferior members in purely scientific terminology - a member of a species that does not help that species grow and prosper is inferior. Since homosexuals cannot reproduce (at least by themselves), they are inferior to the members of the race that can. Therefore, homosexuality would have been obsolete thousands of years ago. Since it is still around, it is classified as a genetic desire as opposed to a genetic trait.Homosexuality is not a genetic trait like the color of one's skin or gender. Homosexuality is a choice based on a genetic desire similar to alcoholism or a bad temper.-Anonymous-I think the author is well meaning, but confused. I oppose gay 'marriage' because words should have meaning. I fully support the recognition of homosexual partnership by secular law. However, this isn't marriage as we have understood it for thousands of years. If we need to create a new term to define this partnership, and a new set of laws to govern it, that would be fine. To simply adopt marriage to normalize a different type of lifestyle is fundamentally wrong. Civil union is probably also an unfair alternative, but 'marriage' is taken. Homosexuals should develop a new term, with a unique definition for their lifestyle.-Robert-If we as a society allow homosexual marriage, then we must also accept the legality of polygamy, incestuous marriage, and many other forms of relationships that are wrong in societys eyes...-Michael-This article addresses a very controversial issue in our society, and it is very refreshing to hear opinions that are so strongly backed by one's personal beliefs and values. I respect Reason's opinions, but in return, I would like to voice my own. First and foremost, it is my own Christian belief that homosexuality is indeed a sin. I know that you have probably had a lot of scripture thrown at you, so I'll refrain from that. As you mentioned, I also believe that it is wrong to judge someone else. That is not any human being's job on this earth. However, I also know that in my religion and in my conscience, I cannot support something or a lifestyle that I do not find right or pleasing to my God. While some may see this as 'judgmental' or 'wrong', I would simply ask that I too would not be judged by those who feel that their opinions on this topic are superior to my own. I believe that everyone has the right to believe as they want. Therefore, I respect your opinion, but must say that my own opinion is not inferior, and consequently will never change. As long as I can speak out on what I believe and what I see as right, I will. I hope that everyone else in the world will do the same. Thank you for your time. I love the articles on SIN! They make my day. -Megan-This is basically the same, tired argument I have read from every other person concerning gay marriage. I guess the author wanted what has been said over and over with her name at the top. Here are some of the problems with the article:'They oppose it for moral issues. ... However, they do not have the right to take away the freedoms and rights of other citizens.' In even the freest societies (America), there is a general consensus of what is good and what is bad. The majority of Americans view robbery, and having sex with children as bad. The majority of Americans also do not agree that homosexual couples should be able to marry. Everyone who talks about imposing morals can't get around the fact that this is what Americans want, plain and simple. Now, you might say the majority can be wrong, you bet it can. But the majority is not always wrong, its right a good bit of the time.'It is not the place of the government or the people to decide what the country's morals should be. It is the individual's right...'So with this relative reasoning no one could tell you what to do. Society depends on people following rules, or it will crumble because order cannot be held. Allowing each person to decide what they feel like doing is called anarchy. Try Haiti right now, you could do whatever you want, and I bet you'll get to see what other people feel like doing to you.'It is not to long ago that African-Americans were denied certain rights in this country.'It would surprise me greatly if someone making this statement actually thought about it and believed it. To compare the history of Africans brought over for slavery in America is a slap in the face to the descendents of these people. To extend this, one could compare the treatment of Indians (Native Americans for you politically correct bleeding hearts) to what the gay community is going through. Not able to get married compared to broken treaties and the whole of Jim Crow laws is moronic. Both of these ethnic groups have suffered greatly and their histories are far more brutal than the inconvenience of not being able to marry.To put it bluntly, youre wrong, and America agrees with me.-Nathan-Since when was this country run by minority groups? It seems to me that almost all important legislation on controversial social issues is made in favor of the minorities. If the majority of the country is against gay marriage, and they are, then our legislation should reflect that. By the way, most people see homosexuality as a perversion or nature and are opposed to it altogether. Society today has taught us to live with it - 'Don't ask, don't tell.' But there is obviously something very wrong with it if a society as diverse as ours is still so opposed to it. The fact that the media, and now potentially the government, is forcing society to accept it is a reflection of the increasing moral degradation in America.-Mike-I'm not religious, nor do I care about what gay/lesbian couples do. However, marriage is for people of the faith. When the faith explicitly frowns upon it, you have a problem. It would be like having Calvin's and Hobbes 'No Girls Club' having to allow membership to girls. Sometimes you just have to accept that the way you are living your life does not allow for certain things. You dont expect Black people to join the Klan meetings, nor do I expect to get married to a Hindo woman because I eat steak everyday. People today just need to chill out. ALSO this article wasn't funny, but still funnier then Josh Kupecs article.-Kyle- Gibson, The Passion, and Anti-SemitismBy Chris WatersI feel this is one of the most well-written articles I have read on this site. Even if one does not agree with the viewpoints, the arguments were concise and supported by fact. However, on a cynical note, I would implore Chris to realize that the media is largely controlled by Jews and Democrats, and unfortunately, they often abuse that medium for the advancement of their political platform. Fortunately, we all have the unalienable right to turn off the TV and put down the newspapers. Ignore the propaganda and continue to think critically. Pity those who attack Mr. Gibson, and remember the words of Robert Frost: 'Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is also great and would suffice.-Sean-No matter who made this movie, no matter how spotless his/her family was about prejudice, this allegation would still be made. The problem is that it is near impossible to produce The Passion of Christ without having at least one Jewish person condemning Christ. I think the main thing to remember is that Christ and all his disciples were Jewish themselves. Yes, this story led to centuries of anti-Semitism. That does not mean that the modern day audience, with its much better education, is going to be moved to anti-Semitism just because they watch the movie of the Passion.-J-The Vatican denies that the Pope has given the film his seal of approval not out of any concern for appearances, but just out of fairness. As a general rule, the Pope does not comment on any popular art, because to do so would be to unfairly endorse or condemn one work over another.-Aaron-Awesome article about the passion movie. I'm sick of hearing everyone complain and get confused based on a few people thinking this movie is anti-Semitic. I've heard the movie is largely fictional and all sorts of other nonsense. Why does everyone jump to conclusions before they've even seen the movie? It's one thing to see it and then have an opinion, but too many people have strongly negative comments about this movie already without even watching it. Thanks for the good article that puts things in perspective.-Kyle-Wow, even an editorial is not allowed to present incorrect remarks. Granted, overly biased (and slightly ignorant) zealous religious remarks are unfortunately fair game, but a blanket incorrect generalization about 'objective third parties' isn't. Routinely contradicting yourself within an article isn't too wise either. Perhaps you would be better suited to at least wait until the movie is released before blindly supporting some exploitive Hollywood production.-Ben-I find your remarks to be hypocritical. You blast Chris for writing on aspects of the movie before watching it, but then you refer to it as some exploitive Hollywood production before seeing it yourself. Also, you mentioned contradictions in this article, but you failed to provide any examples. Not agreeing with an article is one thing, but attacking it because you dont agree with it without providing any basis is another. It was actually Mel Gibsons hand shown in the movie nailing Jesus to the Cross to show that it was as much his fault as anyones.-Casey-I agree wholeheartedly with this article. Mel Gibson made this film as accurate to the Biblical histories in the four Gospels as he could. Nowhere in the four Gospels, or anywhere in the entire Bible for that matter, is it written that the Jewish race is to blame for Christ's death. Anyone who knows much about the Bible at all knows that the Jews have always been God's chosen people. One of the underlying messages in the New Testament is that we should love EVERYONE. Mel Gibson put it best when he said, To be racist towards anyone is against the tenants of my faith...... Great article Chris.-Christian- Its All Jinxys FaultBy Melissa LienertI think guys like cats because its kinda like simulating that you've got a woman. Therefore if you're lonely, you can just pretend that you have a girl by trying to pet your cat. It's the same thing... You try to have a little fun, and the cat/girl plays games at first, never quite letting you pet it. It then finally gives in and lets you give it a little pleasure until it loses interest, at which point, it scratches the hell out of you and leaves, never to return again... well, never to return until it's feeling lonely and depressed.-Sam-You should love your cat, but not looooove your cat. Seek help, if only for your dear feline friends sake. I am Chivalrous and Proud of ItBy Adam JunkWe need more men like you. Will you marry me?-Sandra-I don't know how the author obtained the picture attached to this article. It is a Chinese soldier dead in WWII! Please dont abuse these images!-Li-We obtained the picture from Googles image gallery, a public site. It was used to convey the seriousness of the article. Sorry if you were personally offended, but I think abuse is a bit strong of a word. Finally a voice of reason. You're outlook is a sane and respectable one -- and one I wished more guys had the confidence to hold. On behalf of all the girls out there you've been polite to, Thank You!-Rebecca-I think your article was cute, but if the government does not enforce equal pay for equal work (the dream for the ERA) then who will? You honestly think that big corporations will just become ethically conscious?-Sarah-I really wish the Editor would start rejecting the 'I am blah blah and here are my view points.' I like reading diaries as much as the next guy, but this brings nothing to the table. I get the feeling that some of these writers are just sitting around in the room. Surely something interesting outside happened?To The author:A Simple 'Hi my name is ___' name tag would have done. Just write: I am chivalrous and proud of it.-Kyle-At SIN, we try to represent a variety of viewpoints for our readers. Because we do not adhere to a news format, we allow articles from student writers (all volunteers by the way) of a more personal nature to be posted on our site in hopes that other students will be able to relate to the stories. However, I will keep your comments in mind when choosing my articles for the week. Its All Jinxys FaultBy Melissa LienertI thoroughly enjoyed C.J.'s article. It was playful, yet in some ways, hit on a topic one first-year might not think about. I would like to see more work from him if possible -- I like his style.-Ashley-But how can you compete with hallway bowling? With real pins and bowling ball at 4 oclock in the morning, no less.-Doug-Top TenI wasn't sure where to post this and all, but what happened to the top ten? A Kiefer Sutherland made out of fudge? Come on, that joke is barely worthy of rotten fruit being thrown at your head. -Anonymous-In my opinion, the utter bizarreness of the items of last weeks list, as well as the visual images they may provoke was the appeal of last weeks list (I mean, you have to admit to pondering a Christopher Walken-shaped bag of cottage cheese for a moment or two). However, humor is subjective, and therefore, I am aware that some will not agree with me or the author. MEGA-STORE cometh... By Devin SpringerAwesome....this story is just true enough to be really funny. Some people joke about Wal-Mart taking over the world... but Im serious. Wal-Mart is going to take over the world. We're not going to have a world government; we're going to have a world corporation. Everyone will work for Wal-Mart, everyone will eat Wal-Mart, and there will be statues of Sam Walton on every street corner... What I haven't figured out is whether this is gonna be a good world or a bad one. I think Ill join the Target resistance force... simply because life would be more entertaining that way. =)-Doug- Microsoft: The Truth ToldBy Adam LotiaIt's absurd how this article neglects all the accomplishments that Microsoft has made. If it weren't for them, then we wouldn't be as far along as we are now.-James-First off, the original icon driven OS was from Xerox which Macintosh and Micro$oft both took from. That gave birth to a Mac OS and Windows v3.1. Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 both are just a shell over MS-DOS (which was originally Quick &amp; Dirty Operating System, QDOS). There are four versions of win95, the original upgrade for win3.1, version A, version B, and version C which was right before win98 came out then followed by win98SE. I agree that win ME was a horrid OS and should have never been released. Win2kpro was never really intended to be used by home users and was the most stable GUI-OS ever released by MS. Whistler was a beta release of winXP and they look a lot a like but are about the same as a concept car and the actual production model. Yes MS has problems but they have also made huge leaps in the computer world, most of which were other company's ideas stolen then paid for later, which has helped the world move forward. I suggest you do some more research about what you are bashing before you bash it.-Shelby-Good article, you obviously know a lot about computers. Very good point on ME, it was easily the worst thing created EVER. The only thing I question is you said XP home was more expensive 'in some cases' I have yet to see it be more expensive. It's usually 10-40 dollars cheaper depending on how inflated the original price of each is. However, you may have a source I don't. Not harping on your article, it was very good and well written.-Eric- Socially SpeakingBy Jaron WilliamsI was completely blown away by your article. I couldn't agree with you more. Sadly, the South I must admit is slow in gaining the concept of having more color in the population. Perhaps things would gain a faster popularity if everyone stepped out of their own box and realized that well over 3/4 of this earth is populated with beautiful colors of black, brown, red, yellow, etc. But until that day, always being the one that changes stereotypical labeling can only open more doors for so called 'color-blindness'. Looking forward to your next article, -J'Lynn-I, for one, would like to express my most heartfelt praise to Jaron for his article 'Socially Speaking'. I myself am a minority on campus and have always been taught that everyone is to be treated the same, but at the same time that I must be wary of the world. Jaron's writing was amazing. I was immediately drawn in and I could totally identify with everything that he was saying. I knew exactly how he felt. He said everything with great honesty and charming humor. This was one of the few times I felt the time I spent reading a campus article was time well spent. -Amber-This was a beautiful article. I was brought up to choose my friends based on personality, not color, and have never had a reason to regret it. I do see color, but it's irrelevant once they start speaking.-VE-A++++ Article, would buy again.The only thing missing was a point. Hope you include one next week!-Kyle- The Ex-Files Part DeuxBy Elisabeth RennieFor the love of God!Who cares?-Nick-Don't you love it when girls complain on and on about being stalked by guys? There are ways to avoid this. Maybe you should consider involving a different type of article. Not just the whiny girl articles, there are plenty already on here.-Heather- VD: Kupec on LoveBy Josh KupecWow. You should masturbate more. Or maybe less.-Jambalama-God bless you, laddy. That almost brought a tear to my eye. The truth will set you free.-Chris- What Youre Really ThinkingBy Leah HoffmanI really didn't need to see damnuh or damn in this article so much. I appreciate the different style, but I didn't get anything from this piece at all. Just the fact that I'm glad she doesn't sit by ME in class.-Lucy-Thought Id compliment your article. I always appreciate insightfulness and one thing that's always impressed me about OU. Now working toward graduate school here at OU Tulsa, I am always impressed by you all at main campus, --i.e. very intelligent. (And Id guess cute, too!)-Joey-I can identify with this writer's pain...damnuh those gen ed courses...-Heather- "/><div itemprop="publisher" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization">

In this day and age, that is unbelievable. Free speech is one thing but to make a mockery of it is another. How about they try a white male, whose family came over on the Mayflower, owned a plantation and slaves, gave up 40 acres and a mule after Emancipation and now currently claims to be an upstanding individual who isn't a racist because he "knows a black dude?; Perhaps they will. The only problem I have with this article is the amount of clichs used. Clichs are also a "thing of the past" along with racism. Keep writing because it definitely evokes emotion, and that is what literature needs to do. Thank you, Jaron.-Dubb-I completely agree with the overall message of your article. Black history month needs more respect, Black history needs more recognition in our history books and in our culture. I am a staunch supporter of human rights, and thus of minority rights and womens rights. However, your tone and approach in your article to these issues concerns me. Calling people whom you think are ignorant does nothing except maybe diminish your integrity. Referring to white people as ole boss borders on racism. I am excited to see an African-American writer on SIN bringing social injustices and African-American rights into a condition of visibility. However, if in doing this you create more division between races, pitting one against the other, you will be counter-productive and achieve very little. OU is extremely segregated, just look at our fraternity system. The last thing we need is more division. -Patrick-If people are so quick to jump at the fact that racism is still present in our country, maybe we should look at why. I don't think any particular race should have a specific month in which everyone should recognize their history. To help put a stop to racism, people of all races should appreciate each other for what they have to offer...something that is not just skin deep.-Jessica-Your article on Black History Month showed the importance of this often-criticized acknowledgement of American cultural richness. White guilt over past and present oppression is useless baggage, and does not solve anything; if more of us whites can dump some of this baggage, maybe the quotes that start off your essay will stop replaying themselves endlessly in our heads when we look for ways to improve interactions between ourselves and people not like us. Whatever else Black History Month may be, as you yourself point out, it should not be an excuse to renew old and useless patterns of whining defensiveness and resistance to cultural change.-Daniel-<a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=261045551">Abercrombie Makes Religion Cool Again</a>By Mark PottsI could very easily say some offending words to you, but I would only be stooping down to your childish level. The Bible is not something to promote sales of an item. It is to bring people to salvation. Maybe instead of tearing and burning the pages you ought to start reading them. Do some soul searching!!!OK, listen carefully now. Every article on Slant, the portion of our site where you found this article, is not serious. Mark was not suggesting that Abercrombie sell bibles. He was actually making fun of Abercrombies ruthless marketing attempts. I suggest you actually read an article before writing an angry response. This guy is a real straight shooter with upper-level management written all over him. His social commentary doesnt come across as too preachy. It just makes you think. I like it. Give him a raise -- he is a great writer with lots of good points.-Don- A raise, it is. More pizza coupons and free movie passes will definitely be coming his way. Now that I have stopped laughing I can type this comment. If this actually were to happen, I wouldn't be too surprised. All the people in America striving to be popular will waste, I mean spend, all of daddy's money to be in the "group" with everybody else that looks exactly like them. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who views preworn cloths as a retarded idea. Yes I have some cloths that look like the Abercrombie stuff but after years of use of those jeans, which only cost me $40-50, they look identical to the jeans that people with too much money and too little intelligence pay $80-$100 for. Now its time to get off my soap box and go off to class with my non-Abercrombie cloths.-Shelby- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=461590136">Bands You're Not Listening To: Super Furry Animals</a>By Mark PottsI just wanted to agree with you that this band is really great. I saw them this summer in Spain, they put on the best performance out of all the bands that were at this show. I was very impressed. It is hard to find their older albums here. Thanks for giving this band the credit they deserve.-Roxanne-Dude, I have been listening to Super Furry Animals for three years now. They rock. I think my favorite song is Golden Retriever. Your article was very good. Keep writing.-Ross- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=338435521">Breaking up Is Hard to Do</a>By Andrew TowerVery nicely written, I agree as well.-Vickie- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=1919734301">Candy Hearts &amp; Ex-Lax</a>By Leah HoffmanFour words for you Leah: What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I rest my case.-Amanda-I think Leo is not all that bad. I have a new found respect for him due to the movie Gangs of New York. He was hardcore in that movie and not the whiney baby he was in Titanic. And have you ever seen Romeo and Juliet? He was a mean pimp who took out Tybalt without blinking. Plus he got with the FINE Ms. Claire Danes. Enough said.-Jrod-David Hasselhoff was on Baywatch and his chest is hairy. Not as hairy as when he was on Knight Rider, but I think that is a whole different article. -Laura- I dont know whether to be impressed or frightened by your vigilance of Hasselhoffs hirsute body. <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=812776892">Fresh Air</a>By Danny MarroquinDanny was a very smart addition to the SIN family.-Bobbie We agree, and thank you. <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=1878393086">Gay Marriage?</a>By Holly ReasonThis is to all those close-minded bigots out there who hide behind Holy Scripture to justify their hatred. Have you actually read the Bible thoroughly? Have you taken into account that, over the centuries, it has been translated and interpreted by those wishing to portray their already established prejudices? I have done extensive research on this, and if you look at the original Hebrew Scriptures, you will find that nowhere in the Bible does it condemn a monogamous, same-sex relationship between two consenting adults. The direct references to homosexuality refer to general sins such as orgies or rape, not a loving relationship between adults.To the person who claimed that being gay is a choice: are you gay? Do you know what it's like to live in a world where everyone says you are wrong and are going to burn for your sins? Do you know what it's like to fear for your safety and well-being every day because what you believe is different from someone else's views, and therefore wrong? If not, then I would suggest you not use that argument anymore. Why would anyone choose to live a life like that? I doubt someone's intrinsic desire to be different is so great that they would daily threaten their own lives. Whats more, biological and psychological studies have found evidence that homosexuality is a natural human occurrence. Rare, yes, but nonetheless natural. Furthermore, this country can no longer afford to base its laws solely on the morality of the Christian belief. There are too many differing viewpoints in this country to do so. One must encourage the equality and freedom for ALL citizens, even if there are those that would oppose it. Discrimination is discrimination, and should not be tolerated on any level.To the man who stated the article was garbage and should not be on the site: it is her opinion, in the opinion section. She was a right to post it there, just as you do. To the person who argued that marriage is a holy union: gays are not fighting for any religious acceptance, but for recognition from our supposedly impartial government whose job it is to protect equality for ALL. The issue of morality is best left to those involved personally, not to the intolerant masses.-Chris-Thank you."Speaking of Christian morals, it is my understanding that the Christian religion also teaches not to judge other people. Who are Oklahomans and Americans to judge whether or not gay and lesbian people are making moral or immoral decisions?"The author's understanding is wrong and is a fundamental misconception about the Christian beliefs. We are taught not to judge a person but to judge their actions - i.e., I would never say, "You're a bad person and are going to Hell. I would, however, as God tells us to, say that a certain behavior is sinful and that you should turn away from it.Please don't attempt to use generalities to imply something other than what God teaches us. There IS a difference between judging a person and judging that person's behavior.-Ana-Homosexuality is a choice. People do have a tendency towards one sex over the other, but it is comparable to alcoholism through genetics as opposed to the color of one's skin.Science continues to hold onto the paradigm of "the survival of the fittest." Now that homosexuals have been voicing their opinions, science has decided that homosexuality is not a choice. Science concludes that any inferior members of a race are naturally rid of or changed through evolution. I equate homosexuals to inferior members in purely scientific terminology - a member of a species that does not help that species grow and prosper is inferior. Since homosexuals cannot reproduce (at least by themselves), they are inferior to the members of the race that can. Therefore, homosexuality would have been obsolete thousands of years ago. Since it is still around, it is classified as a genetic desire as opposed to a genetic trait.Homosexuality is not a genetic trait like the color of one's skin or gender. Homosexuality is a choice based on a genetic desire similar to alcoholism or a bad temper.-Anonymous-I think the author is well meaning, but confused. I oppose gay "marriage" because words should have meaning. I fully support the recognition of homosexual partnership by secular law. However, this isn't marriage as we have understood it for thousands of years. If we need to create a new term to define this partnership, and a new set of laws to govern it, that would be fine. To simply adopt marriage to normalize a different type of lifestyle is fundamentally wrong. Civil union is probably also an unfair alternative, but "marriage" is taken. Homosexuals should develop a new term, with a unique definition for their lifestyle.-Robert-If we as a society allow homosexual marriage, then we must also accept the legality of polygamy, incestuous marriage, and many other forms of relationships that are wrong in societys eyes...-Michael-This article addresses a very controversial issue in our society, and it is very refreshing to hear opinions that are so strongly backed by one's personal beliefs and values. I respect Reason's opinions, but in return, I would like to voice my own. First and foremost, it is my own Christian belief that homosexuality is indeed a sin. I know that you have probably had a lot of scripture thrown at you, so I'll refrain from that. As you mentioned, I also believe that it is wrong to judge someone else. That is not any human being's job on this earth. However, I also know that in my religion and in my conscience, I cannot support something or a lifestyle that I do not find right or pleasing to my God. While some may see this as "judgmental" or "wrong", I would simply ask that I too would not be judged by those who feel that their opinions on this topic are superior to my own. I believe that everyone has the right to believe as they want. Therefore, I respect your opinion, but must say that my own opinion is not inferior, and consequently will never change. As long as I can speak out on what I believe and what I see as right, I will. I hope that everyone else in the world will do the same. Thank you for your time. I love the articles on SIN! They make my day. -Megan-This is basically the same, tired argument I have read from every other person concerning gay marriage. I guess the author wanted what has been said over and over with her name at the top. Here are some of the problems with the article:"They oppose it for moral issues. ... However, they do not have the right to take away the freedoms and rights of other citizens." In even the freest societies (America), there is a general consensus of what is good and what is bad. The majority of Americans view robbery, and having sex with children as bad. The majority of Americans also do not agree that homosexual couples should be able to marry. Everyone who talks about imposing morals can't get around the fact that this is what Americans want, plain and simple. Now, you might say the majority can be wrong, you bet it can. But the majority is not always wrong, its right a good bit of the time."It is not the place of the government or the people to decide what the country's morals should be. It is the individual's right..."So with this relative reasoning no one could tell you what to do. Society depends on people following rules, or it will crumble because order cannot be held. Allowing each person to decide what they feel like doing is called anarchy. Try Haiti right now, you could do whatever you want, and I bet you'll get to see what other people feel like doing to you."It is not to long ago that African-Americans were denied certain rights in this country."It would surprise me greatly if someone making this statement actually thought about it and believed it. To compare the history of Africans brought over for slavery in America is a slap in the face to the descendents of these people. To extend this, one could compare the treatment of Indians (Native Americans for you politically correct bleeding hearts) to what the gay community is going through. Not able to get married compared to broken treaties and the whole of Jim Crow laws is moronic. Both of these ethnic groups have suffered greatly and their histories are far more brutal than the inconvenience of not being able to marry.To put it bluntly, youre wrong, and America agrees with me.-Nathan-Since when was this country run by minority groups? It seems to me that almost all important legislation on controversial social issues is made in favor of the minorities. If the majority of the country is against gay marriage, and they are, then our legislation should reflect that. By the way, most people see homosexuality as a perversion or nature and are opposed to it altogether. Society today has taught us to live with it - "Don't ask, don't tell." But there is obviously something very wrong with it if a society as diverse as ours is still so opposed to it. The fact that the media, and now potentially the government, is forcing society to accept it is a reflection of the increasing moral degradation in America.-Mike-I'm not religious, nor do I care about what gay/lesbian couples do. However, marriage is for people of the faith. When the faith explicitly frowns upon it, you have a problem. It would be like having Calvin's and Hobbes 'No Girls Club' having to allow membership to girls. Sometimes you just have to accept that the way you are living your life does not allow for certain things. You dont expect Black people to join the Klan meetings, nor do I expect to get married to a Hindo woman because I eat steak everyday. People today just need to chill out. ALSO this article wasn't funny, but still funnier then Josh Kupecs article.-Kyle- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=663264663">Gibson, The Passion, and Anti-Semitism</a>By Chris WatersI feel this is one of the most well-written articles I have read on this site. Even if one does not agree with the viewpoints, the arguments were concise and supported by fact. However, on a cynical note, I would implore Chris to realize that the media is largely controlled by Jews and Democrats, and unfortunately, they often abuse that medium for the advancement of their political platform. Fortunately, we all have the unalienable right to turn off the TV and put down the newspapers. Ignore the propaganda and continue to think critically. Pity those who attack Mr. Gibson, and remember the words of Robert Frost: "Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is also great and would suffice.-Sean-No matter who made this movie, no matter how spotless his/her family was about prejudice, this allegation would still be made. The problem is that it is near impossible to produce The Passion of Christ without having at least one Jewish person condemning Christ. I think the main thing to remember is that Christ and all his disciples were Jewish themselves. Yes, this story led to centuries of anti-Semitism. That does not mean that the modern day audience, with its much better education, is going to be moved to anti-Semitism just because they watch the movie of the Passion.-J-The Vatican denies that the Pope has given the film his seal of approval not out of any concern for appearances, but just out of fairness. As a general rule, the Pope does not comment on any popular art, because to do so would be to unfairly endorse or condemn one work over another.-Aaron-Awesome article about the passion movie. I'm sick of hearing everyone complain and get confused based on a few people thinking this movie is anti-Semitic. I've heard the movie is largely fictional and all sorts of other nonsense. Why does everyone jump to conclusions before they've even seen the movie? It's one thing to see it and then have an opinion, but too many people have strongly negative comments about this movie already without even watching it. Thanks for the good article that puts things in perspective.-Kyle-Wow, even an editorial is not allowed to present incorrect remarks. Granted, overly biased (and slightly ignorant) zealous religious remarks are unfortunately fair game, but a blanket incorrect generalization about "objective third parties" isn't. Routinely contradicting yourself within an article isn't too wise either. Perhaps you would be better suited to at least wait until the movie is released before blindly supporting some exploitive Hollywood production.-Ben-I find your remarks to be hypocritical. You blast Chris for writing on aspects of the movie before watching it, but then you refer to it as some exploitive Hollywood production before seeing it yourself. Also, you mentioned contradictions in this article, but you failed to provide any examples. Not agreeing with an article is one thing, but attacking it because you dont agree with it without providing any basis is another. It was actually Mel Gibsons hand shown in the movie nailing Jesus to the Cross to show that it was as much his fault as anyones.-Casey-I agree wholeheartedly with this article. Mel Gibson made this film as accurate to the Biblical histories in the four Gospels as he could. Nowhere in the four Gospels, or anywhere in the entire Bible for that matter, is it written that the Jewish race is to blame for Christ's death. Anyone who knows much about the Bible at all knows that the Jews have always been God's chosen people. One of the underlying messages in the New Testament is that we should love EVERYONE. Mel Gibson put it best when he said, To be racist towards anyone is against the tenants of my faith...... Great article Chris.-Christian- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=836275234">Its All Jinxys Fault</a>By Melissa LienertI think guys like cats because its kinda like simulating that you've got a woman. Therefore if you're lonely, you can just pretend that you have a girl by trying to pet your cat. It's the same thing... You try to have a little fun, and the cat/girl plays games at first, never quite letting you pet it. It then finally gives in and lets you give it a little pleasure until it loses interest, at which point, it scratches the hell out of you and leaves, never to return again... well, never to return until it's feeling lonely and depressed.-Sam-You should love your cat, but not looooove your cat.

Sorry if you were personally offended, but I think abuse is a bit strong of a word. Finally a voice of reason. You're outlook is a sane and respectable one -- and one I wished more guys had the confidence to hold. On behalf of all the girls out there you've been polite to, Thank You!-Rebecca-I think your article was cute, but if the government does not enforce equal pay for equal work (the dream for the ERA) then who will? You honestly think that big corporations will just become ethically conscious?-Sarah-I really wish the Editor would start rejecting the "I am blah blah and here are my view points." I like reading diaries as much as the next guy, but this brings nothing to the table. I get the feeling that some of these writers are just sitting around in the room. Surely something interesting outside happened?To The author:A Simple "Hi my name is ___" name tag would have done. Just write: I am chivalrous and proud of it.-Kyle-At SIN, we try to represent a variety of viewpoints for our readers. Because we do not adhere to a news format, we allow articles from student writers (all volunteers by the way) of a more personal nature to be posted on our site in hopes that other students will be able to relate to the stories.

Come on, that joke is barely worthy of rotten fruit being thrown at your head. -Anonymous-In my opinion, the utter bizarreness of the items of last weeks list, as well as the visual images they may provoke was the appeal of last weeks list (I mean, you have to admit to pondering a Christopher Walken-shaped bag of cottage cheese for a moment or two).

If it weren't for them, then we wouldn't be as far along as we are now.-James-First off, the original icon driven OS was from Xerox which Macintosh and Micro$oft both took from. That gave birth to a Mac OS and Windows v3.1. Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 both are just a shell over MS-DOS (which was originally Quick &amp; Dirty Operating System, QDOS). There are four versions of win95, the original upgrade for win3.1, version A, version B, and version C which was right before win98 came out then followed by win98SE. I agree that win ME was a horrid OS and should have never been released. Win2kpro was never really intended to be used by home users and was the most stable GUI-OS ever released by MS. Whistler was a beta release of winXP and they look a lot a like but are about the same as a concept car and the actual production model. Yes MS has problems but they have also made huge leaps in the computer world, most of which were other company's ideas stolen then paid for later, which has helped the world move forward. I suggest you do some more research about what you are bashing before you bash it.-Shelby-Good article, you obviously know a lot about computers. Very good point on ME, it was easily the worst thing created EVER. The only thing I question is you said XP home was more expensive "in some cases" I have yet to see it be more expensive. It's usually 10-40 dollars cheaper depending on how inflated the original price of each is. However, you may have a source I don't. Not harping on your article, it was very good and well written.-Eric- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=1700079187">Socially Speaking</a>By Jaron WilliamsI was completely blown away by your article. I couldn't agree with you more. Sadly, the South I must admit is slow in gaining the concept of having more color in the population. Perhaps things would gain a faster popularity if everyone stepped out of their own box and realized that well over 3/4 of this earth is populated with beautiful colors of black, brown, red, yellow, etc. But until that day, always being the one that changes stereotypical labeling can only open more doors for so called "color-blindness". Looking forward to your next article, -J'Lynn-I, for one, would like to express my most heartfelt praise to Jaron for his article "Socially Speaking". I myself am a minority on campus and have always been taught that everyone is to be treated the same, but at the same time that I must be wary of the world. Jaron's writing was amazing. I was immediately drawn in and I could totally identify with everything that he was saying. I knew exactly how he felt. He said everything with great honesty and charming humor. This was one of the few times I felt the time I spent reading a campus article was time well spent. -Amber-This was a beautiful article. I was brought up to choose my friends based on personality, not color, and have never had a reason to regret it. I do see color, but it's irrelevant once they start speaking.-VE-A++++ Article, would buy again.The only thing missing was a point. Hope you include one next week!-Kyle- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=1778314777">The Ex-Files Part Deux</a>By Elisabeth RennieFor the love of God!Who cares?-Nick-Don't you love it when girls complain on and on about being stalked by guys? There are ways to avoid this. Maybe you should consider involving a different type of article. Not just the whiny girl articles, there are plenty already on here.-Heather- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=982464624">VD: Kupec on Love</a>By Josh KupecWow. You should masturbate more. Or maybe less.-Jambalama-God bless you, laddy. That almost brought a tear to my eye. The truth will set you free.-Chris- <a href="http://sin.ou.edu/daily_content/view_article.php?article_id=1770578608">What Youre Really Thinking</a>By Leah HoffmanI really didn't need to see damnuh or damn in this article so much. I appreciate the different style, but I didn't get anything from this piece at all. Just the fact that I'm glad she doesn't sit by ME in class.-Lucy-Thought Id compliment your article. I always appreciate insightfulness and one thing that's always impressed me about OU. Now working toward graduate school here at OU Tulsa, I am always impressed by you all at main campus, --i.e. very intelligent. (And Id guess cute, too!)-Joey-I can identify with this writer's pain...damnuh those gen ed courses...-Heather-</p><div id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"></div><p>hello there &amp; you too</p><div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"></div>

<p style="“font-family:Times" lato>If you've read this far, you are as invested in this city and campus as we are. That's why we are asking you to invest in us.</p>
<p style="“font-family:Times" lato>Since 1916, the Daily has served the Norman and OU communities with free independent journalism, with all decisions made locally with no administrative, governmental or corporate influence. We provide Norman with the city's largest reporting staff, drawn from one of the nation's top journalism colleges. Our coverage is routinely honored at state and national levels. And we're advised by a veteran professional staff with a mission to help us build on our legacy as a launching pad for media professionals.</p>
<p style="“font-family:Times" lato>OU students pay about $14 in annual fees that help support the Daily. If you find value in our work and are not a student, please consider matching or exceeding that with a one-time or recurring donation. In an era when subscriptions to paywalled news organizations routinely exceed $100 annually, grassroots support from readers like you can collectively make a transformative difference in our organization.</p>
