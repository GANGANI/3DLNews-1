<div>Actress Teri Garr has many talents. You've enjoyed her in movies for years. But her ability to face Multiple Sclerosis with humor is an astounding gift. Teri was the keynote speaker for the Women Against MS luncheon at OKC Golf and Country Club -- and it was the largest seated luncheon the club has EVER held (675 folks).<BR>Sue Ann Hyde and Michelle Ellis, co-chairmen, along with  Louise Bennett, did such a successful job of gathering upport that 100 percent of the money raised went to the fight against MS. In other words, they secured underwriting for the entire event. Many sponsors jumped in to help, but the Presenting Sponsor was Sorono, and the PLATINUM SPONSORS were Chesapeake Energy, Dorchester Capital, Jimmy Dobbs, Lisa Dulaney Fisher, Griffin Communications/News 9, McKinney & Stringer PC, OPUBCO and the Payne Family.<BR>Happily, the MS Society can say that more progress has been made in the battle against this disease in the last five years than the last 50! There is a world of new treatment options available.<BR>Teri Garr captured the hearts of her audience when she admitted her first  denials of the diagnosis by telling people, “I have a slight touch of MS.” Just as aside about her celebrity, she told of shopping with her credit card. The clerk said to her, “Funny, you have the same name as that actress.” Teri squinted and pursed her lips as she said back to the clerk, “Uh, don't you think I sort of look like her?” “No, not really,” was the reply.<BR>Sharing very personal information, she mentioned her first symptoms, stumbling, knife-like sharp pains in her arm. “But then,” she grinned, “I WAS jogging in Central Park -- the knife pain wasn't unexpected!” In counting her blessings, she warmed to the subject of her 10-year-old daughter -- and ex-husband. “Operative word, EX,” she snickered.<BR>The crowd rose to its feet as she came to the end of her uplifting message of living with MS, her positive attitude, and the incredible progress being made toward the solution for this disease.<BR>Among the huge crowd were Carol Sue Manley, David Reynolds, Jane Williams, Anna Noel Williams, Kelly McClain, Corey Blake, Jill Swisher, Robyn Rankin, Laurie Givens, Carole Jo Evans, Cynda Ottaway, Lynn White, Penny McCaleb and Kay Oliver. Others supporters were Angela Reynolds, Lori Hill, president of the Oklahoma Chapter for MS Paula Cortner, Jann Schwabe, Nancy Ellis, Beth Wells, Gene Barth, Laurie Hyde, Leland Gourley, Janie Comstock and Ciane Hogan. <BR>•Totally in a different vein was the Fiesta and Wedding Shower for Tiffany Keitz and Tim Bergman. Held in Connie and Franklin Naifeh's always welcoming home, the other host couples were Susan and Jay Johnston, Carol and Mike Man, Dianne and Denny Meacham, and Sharri and Rick Russell. Tiffany is the daughter of Sharon and Jim Keitz.<BR>The fun, casual evening ran from indoors to out, with airy and light flower arrangements, Mexican cloths, plates and decorations. The Mexican dinner was fabulous -- but then, when is Mexican food NOT wonderful? Tiffany and Tim had a big old time opening gifts of silver, dishes, kitchen items and pewter pieces -- all things to make a home.<BR>Guests included Karen and De Lawler -- formerly from OKC, now living in Dallas -- and Carolyn and Tommy Stewart from Stillwater, Libby and Todd Naifeh, Pat and Ray Broadfoot, Barbara and Jay Quillian, and Leslie and Ricky Russell. Also fiesta-ing were Cindy and Dick Homsey; C.K. and Hal Clifford; Gale and Lee Bollinger; Marilyn and Charlie Bethea; Mrs. Shelby Green, who is the bride's grandmother; Pam and Jay Green, who are the bride's aunt and uncle; bride's aunt Terry Byers; Tiffany's sister Alee; Linda and Mike Kerran; Shelia and Don Manners; and Linda and Don Carpenter.<BR>•As the long-ago springtime babies mature into geezer-hood, their families think surprise birthday parties are in order. David and Bev Carter's children and spouses (Lori and Chip Carter and Susan and Chris Carter) just LOVED sending out invitations describing David, “At 65, it's Social Security and Medicare -- We're glad he still has his own teeth and hair…” Just wait kids, all too soon, your kids will be inviting friends for your 65th -- but the message will be different as there probably won't BE any Social Security! That'll get you back. (I'm getting slightly cranky about this age thing as I creep up)<BR>Bev Carter was in charge of keeping David in the dark about this celebration, and the kids did the rest, according to Bev. Lori and Chip's home was splendid with Mexican tables, a big blue pitcher with sunflowers, Bromeliads all over the house, chili lights, hanging baskets and pictures of “Dad” from babyhood on. The teasing was superficial, as there obviously was a lot of love going on here. Chip and Chris made the most moving presentation to their father. David collects prayer books and the boys managed to track down a rare addition in England, from 1736, The Book of Common Prayer. The friends and family were touched at the boys' presentation, and it brought “Poppy” (David) nearly to tears.<BR>Guests joining in David's celebration were Patti and Dick Marshall, Barbara Watson, Bette Jo and Frank Hill, Patty and Roland Tague, Lori and Dodge Hill, Rawsie and Sonny Boyles, Mary Anne Malone, Mary and Joe Rocket, Barbara and Charles Mee and Sue and Tom Nix.<BR>•The planning fairies behind the surprise birthday party for Brooke Phillip's 60th birthday were “T. Ray & the kids.” The KIDS are daughter Marni and her husband Mark Warren, daughter Kendall and husband Coleman Yates and son T. Ray and wife Tia.<BR>Brookie had just a passing thought that something was going on as all the kids were in town. Well, those clever kids squashed that idea when they couldn't decide (in front of Brooke) which night to get a sitter so they could go out to dinner as adults. “Friday night? No, well Saturday? -- Gosh, we'll just eat IN and not need a baby sitter.” Brooke then ABSOLUTELY knew that nothing out of the ordinary was happening.<BR>Yeah, nothing -- just a big party at the Sable room of OKC Golf and Country Club for HER.  At the last minute, her husband, T. Ray, told Brooke he had to run by the Country Club for a photo, as he was requested to be present for the picture of the Integris Baptist Medical Center Foundation Board. Made perfect sense, Baptist Circle of Friends annual gala was happening at the Club that night - DOWNSTAIRS, of course T. Ray needed to be available for a photo!<BR>Upstairs for photos? Well, that's how they always do it for the Beaux Arts, thought Brooke. Bumfuzzled Brooke took in the huge buffet, two cakes and ALL her friends when she stepped into the room. Why were all her friends here for a photo for Baptist Hospital? Duhhh -- blondish moment! Brooke really was shocked, then delighted and had the time of her life at her birthday party!<BR>	<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>Montine Sprehe gave me bunches of wonderful tips from a book she bought -- you're going to love them. If there are no desirable seats (aisle or window) on an airplane, ask to book the middle seat between two people with the same last name. Chances are that they want to sit together and will offer you the window or aisle seat.<BR><BR><BR></div>
