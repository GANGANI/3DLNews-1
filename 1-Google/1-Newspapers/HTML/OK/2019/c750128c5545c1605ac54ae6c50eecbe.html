<div>Sitting in a coffee shop on a brisk January morning, Mary Deane Streich extends her hand and with a smile, offers a bright “Good morning!  It is so nice to see you!”<br>The Oklahoma City native has been named the recipient of the Jim Vallion Award, which will be presented by the Oklahoma AIDS Care Fund at the 27th annual Red Tie Night on Saturday, March 9 at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.<br>“I was totally surprised when I heard the news,” Mary said. “Jim was a great man and he was always very positive and did so many good things.  I feel very honored.”<br>As she reflected on her volunteer efforts with OACF, Mary took a few moments to share her life’s journey, one that began in what is now the Plaza District.<br><br>Early years<br><br>“Growing up, I lived on NW 16th Street,” Mary said.  “Eventually we moved to Nichols Hills.”<br>“My father was president of the Progress Brewing Company, and in his spare time he loved to fish. My mother took care of the household and liked playing golf and bridge. Those were good years.” <br>Mary went to Harding High School, where she enjoyed English and social studies. She liked the music of the day, and when she could, spent time with her friends.<br>“Some of those friends from back then I still keep in touch with today,” Mary said. “We get together once a month and have dinner. There is nothing quite like those life-long friendships.”<br>After graduating from Harding, Mary attended Trinity University in San Antonio. She returned to Oklahoma City, working as a librarian--first at Harding and then at John Marshall High School, before retiring from Westminster School where she had been in development.<br><br>Junior League, Lyric and beyond<br><br>“When I retired from working, I started volunteering with the Junior League of Oklahoma City,” she said. “I really enjoyed that. Eventually I became treasurer and nominating chairman. Then in 1998 I was named ‘Sustainer of the Year.’”<br>Her friendship with Lyric Theatre’s former Artistic Director Nick Demos, led her to a new area of interest.<br>“Nick is the one who got me involved,” Mary said. “He lives in Los Angeles now, but we remain good friends.”<br>“I did Lyric for a long time, and still do. I was on the executive committee and co-chaired the 50th anniversary celebration. In 2017, I received the John Kirkpatrick Award, named for Lyric’s founder. That was such an honor, one for which I am extremely grateful.”<br><br>Oklahoma AIDS Care Fund<br><br>Mary’s volunteerism extended far beyond Junior League and Lyric. She has been actively involved with the Harn Homestead Museum, Science Museum Oklahoma and Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center, among others.  <br>But in the early 1990s, she found a new purpose and a new way of helping those in need.<br>“Rick Moses took me to a Winds House meeting,” Mary remembers.  “That is a home for men living with AIDS. We got involved with some of the people living there and I remember going to the hospital once to visit a man in the last phase of life. They had us put on a gown and a mask, because back then they just didn’t know much about the disease.” <br>“I remember one man just couldn’t take it any longer and jumped off a bridge onto the interstate. It was an awful time and a lot of that happened back then.”<br>About the same time, one well-known Oklahoma City family was dealing with their own tragedy.<br>Barbara Cooper, wife of the late Oklahoma City businessman Jackie Cooper, founded the Oklahoma AIDS Care Fund in 1990, following the death of their son.  Cooper engaged her husband and a small group of volunteers, and they established the fundraiser Red Tie Night.<br>“Mary has been with us almost since the beginning,” Barbara said in a recent phone interview from her Nichols Hills home. “We needed someone to do the seating arrangements and Mary came highly recommended.”  <br>“When I phoned her that first time I heard this strong, wonderful voice. We talked for a bit and she said she didn’t know much about our organization, but she would be happy to help. I knew then we had someone special.”<br>Mary found a new passion for her work, serving on the Red Tie Night Committee and eventually on the OACF Board of Directors.  She also won the prestigious Richard May Award,named for one of the early founders.<br>“She really hit it off with Jack,” Barbara said.  “One year, Jack kept changing the seating arrangements. It was the day of the event and he was still making changes. Just when Mary thought she had the seating chart finished, he would call with something else.” <br>“Finally, she phoned and said ‘Barbara, put him in a room with no phone and let me get this finished!’ She has been such a wonderful friend to us and is so deserving of this award.”<br><br>Eliminating the Stigma<br><br>Today, the national stigma surrounding the disease has changed, Mary said.<br>“I am hoping through our work at OACF we have also helped change the stigma in Oklahoma,” she added.  “People think the disease is gone, and it’s not. And that is still a problem.”<br>The OACF, through its fundraiser Red Tie Night, provides grants to agencies helping those living with HIV/AIDS. But the group does much more than that, offering outreach and education and creating an awareness that the need for support and donations remains strong.<br>“OACF is so much different from when it first started,” Mary said. “There wasn’t any paid staff.  Jackie had a dealership at NW 122nd and May and I would go out there and sit in a salesman’s booth and make phone calls, and Jack would go to his office and make calls, and that’s the way it worked.”  <br>“Eventually we hired Loretta Brower and when she retired Pamela Mowry came along.  She was there a number of years. As we began doing more programs and educational events, Sunshine Schillings joined the staff.”  <br>She said she is optimistic about the new direction OACF is taking now.<br>“I think it is headed in the right direction,” Mary said. “It has good board members, good people.”  <br>“I am humbled to receive the Jim Vallion Award, and am truly thankful. I hope Oklahoma City continues to support Red Tie Night.”  <br>For more information on Red Tie Night, visit <a href="http://www.okaidscarefund.com/redtienight/">www.okaidscarefund.com/redtienight/</a></div>
