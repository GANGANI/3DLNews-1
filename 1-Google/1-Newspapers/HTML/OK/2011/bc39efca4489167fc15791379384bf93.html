<div>Many of you know Rebecca Cooper from Heritage Hall and Oklahoma City school days, and though she doesn’t think it, she’s a really BIG DEAL. Rebecca, living in the DC area, is the on-air anchor of the ABC weekly show, “Washington Business Report,” and is the national correspondent for the ABC local station WJLA. Plus, she’s now a movie star.<br>A riotous sense of humor and very self-deprecating, she was such fun to talk with. She’s very comfortable in her own skin and that’s why being a “movie star” didn’t change her a lick!<br>Rebecca moved to Washington in 1988 to work for then Senator Boren. No grass grew under her feet! Fast forward to the almost present.<br>Director Michael Bay is known in Hollywood for doing things on a BIG scale. Michael wanted a news anchor-person for a part in his new film “Transformers III – Dark of the Moon”. Michael, with Paramount Pictures had the NBC Universal family as a contact, and asked to “borrow an anchor.” There was a policy in place that prevented one of their NBC people from being that anchor. “But,” they said, “Contact Rebecca Cooper – she can get you approved to shoot on the White House lawn.” <br>That led to, “Would you be willing to be our White House reporter?” Rebecca thought that would be a new experience, and said, “Okay.” All of a sudden they called for her head shot and measurements. Whoa! She didn’t have “head shots” and felt she wouldn’t be glamorous enough for this part. And that’s what she told them.<br>Michael Bay looked her up on Google, and said, “You’re perfect – don’t need your head shots.” Rebecca was in a whirl. When she arrived on set she had her own trailer, makeup artist and a wardrobe of Gucci, Dolce&Gabbana, etc. suits – some TEN of them, and bras and shoes in her size. She was in heaven! As an aside she confided to me, “I’m not Jessica Alba, you know.” But she kept repeating to herself, “You KNOW you’ll end up on the cutting room floor. That’s just the way it is in this business.”<br>She wore her own clothing to the set as she didn’t know what was required, and it was, by her description, “a dowdy blue suit.” The movie makers just loved that suit. Rats! With a touch of hope, she asked what they were doing with the pricey designer suits with the tags. Were they being returned to the stores? No, they were to be inventoried and put in a warehouse. She would have loved to have worn one, but alas, show biz!<br>Morning of the shoot she met “her “actor” camera man – as in the movie camera man who followed her around as she broadcast in the film. He was hot! And he was a model. Then they cancelled the shoot. It was a political posturing thing based on a Presidential report that day. <br>Michael Bay had a fit. I mean, A FIT! Larger than life, he was sputtering and screeching, “Who can I have fired? I’m calling Michael Bloomberg!” Meanwhile, Rebecca paced back and forth in her trailer all day. Strings were being pulled and she found herself in a nighttime shoot at the Pentagon. She was amazed as “Transformers” were all over the parking lot, hundreds of extras, cameramen, support staff, etc. All Rebecca hoped for is that she’d be able to choke out her four lines, though she knew there was no likelihood of making it into the final cut. Time passed as there is so much to the process of filming. She was getting nervous as she had a plane she had to catch the next afternoon. How long would this take?<br>She finally met Michael Bay in person and he said as if she were a plastic mannequin just standing there, “She’s PERFECT! We WANT her.” <br>They planned to shoot this segment the next morning, and she said she couldn’t as she HAD to catch a plane. Michael said, “I want her.” The movie folks explained that they had closed down all these streets, had permits in place, etc. Michael said, “Change the permits!”<br>When you’re a big cheese things just happen. Knowing that she HAD to get home the next day, they told Rebecca not to worry; if filming ran late they would charter a plane so she’d arrive when she needed to! Then they gave her some extra lines, she still figured she’d be cut eventually when it was edited.<br>“Transformers” is American Science Fiction, an action film based on the Transformers toy line.<br>My observation is that Rebecca is so appealing that Michael was just enamored, not just because she’s cute, but has such an outgoing personality. His assistants usually do the lighting and blocking shots, but he personally did them for her part. She still was sure this was all show biz and she wouldn’t be in the final film. By the way, she gives full credit for her on-screen presence to her debate classes at Heritage Hall, said they prepared her for everything. Her role was filmed and she made her plane.<br>Rebecca and her three boys, ages 4, 6, 8 went to New York City for the premiere, and were taken aside and placed in the VIP private screening. Her eight-year-old said, “Mom, I know now that you are NOT in the film, they are being too nice to us.”<br>If you didn’t have a chance to see Transformers III, it is coming out in DVD, and her entire “role” is in the film. The hottie/model cameraman was nowhere to be seen, guess his film time was sadly, cut. Can you imagine what a squealing delight that it is for Rebecca’s boys to have mom in such a cool movie? I take my hat off to a busy mother who can raise three children AND work full time. How do you young women do that? Rebecca said that she has the greatest friends to whom she can say, “Can I drop all three boys off for an hour?”, plus a dream babysitter. <br>Many who have worked with Michael Bay will not do so again as he is rumored to be so difficult. Megan Fox didn’t star in Transformers III, because their previous filming had been so contentious. Clearly Rebecca has a mellow and flexible demeanor as she and Michael got a long swimmingly, and are still in contact. Rebecca is just herself; not intimidated by things, has great confidence and is quick on her feet, and it would seem that think Michael found those qualities comfortable and intriguing. That’s Oklahoma upbringing, fer ‘ya.<br>Charlotte Cooper is Rebecca’s mom. She’s very proud of what a great young lady she raised. Rebecca is a star and a dynamo – in many ways!<br>	<br>TRAVEL TIP<br>A cruise vacation can be ideal for the older or disabled traveler. If you tell your travel agent of your needs, that agent will be able to come up with a ship and cruise that will be right for you. Newer ships have wider passageways, halls and doorways and will be more accessible to wheelchairs. Wheelchair passengers are asked to have an able-bodied person accompany them. Book a cabin on an upper deck near the elevators.</div>
