<div>Licking the last of the lemon tart off my lips, I noticed Cindy Shelby observing me with envy. Plaintively, she asked, “Is it wonderful?” As she probably wears a size zero dress, I figured there was a reason for her question. “I gave up desserts for Lent, but it will be over soon and I’m going to make up a big batch of chocolate chip cookies – I make VERY good cookies,” she assured me. Me, being oh, so kind, told her she’d not missed anything at all, the fact that I ate the entire tart (including the berries and mint leaf, plus the plate and fork) was to compliment the chef, not because it was delicious. I don’t lie well.<BR>Bouncy and vivacious Cindy was seated at the ramp-side table as her store, Ruth Meyers, outfitted the models for the Oklahoma Hospitality Club’s 45th annual “Ladies in the News” luncheon and style show. Cindy was handily nearby to prompt adorable Robin Marsh’s commentary, when a particular designer label name wasn’t in the script. I felt very self-important as I was also sitting with speaker Jane Jayroe Gamble; event chairman Pat Grisham; Jan Brown, who was co-chairman of the event; Heidi Russell, who is VP of communication and development for The Children’s Center, and recipient of the 2010 grant; Carey Guthmiller, who donated the grand door prize; and group president Beth Cupp. What a dynamic group of women.<BR>Equally dynamic (and that’s why they were chosen) were the 2011 “Women Transforming Oklahoma.” Those honored were Katy Boren, who is VP of regulatory affairs for Cox Communications in the eastern half of the US; Barbara Butner, who is executive director of Calm Waters; Patrice Douglas, who has been elected for her second term as mayor of Edmond; Robyn Elliott, who serves as media and community development and press secretary to the governor of the Chickasaw Nation; Celine Ferguson is senior VP and CFO of Coppermark Bank; Courtney Gregg developed “All Things Baby, Inc.” which is 100 percent volunteer operated to fill the necessities of mothers in need all over the OKC metro area; Darcie Harris is founder and CEO of EWF International, which supports women in business; Dr. JoAnn Haysbert, who is president of Langston University; Rhonda Hooper, who is president/CEO of Jordan Associates; Dr. Kim Hefner-Poe is a doctor of optometry and volunteers at OK Medical Research Foundation’s Sjogren’s Clinic; Lisa Price was honored for her avid volunteerism (too many to list); Katrina Shaklee began The Sports Group which stages Endeavor Games for athletes with physical disabilities; Mayor Maxine Thomason is the driving force behind and advocate behind the huge success in the City of Mangum and Greer County; and Gail Bellmon Wynne has paragraphs listed as to her volunteer commitments, both in Enid and Oklahoma City.<BR>Among those in the audience cheering for these accomplished women were Becky Fisher, Connie Weber, Joyce Warren, Karen James, Judy Austin, Judie Steeleman, Lynne Trigg, Anita Ashley, ticket chairman Sherrian Geurin, Sharlene Branham, Annette Basey, Rita Moore, Carol Kaspereit, Kay Oliver, Grace Ryan, Lesta Oliver, Beverly Thompson and Paula Berger.<BR>Beautiful and toned Carey Guthmiller is owner/trainer of Fitness Together, and a joy to know. Her gift to the group was a 90-day total body challenge package which includes everything from evaluation, fitness sessions, grocery trips to Saturday Boot Camps, to nutritional programs, and custom cardio. Carey was poised and funny. When a luncheon guest introduced herself to Carey, she said in turn, “I’m Carey Guthmiller – soon to be Carey Cline – thank you, Lord!” Apparently she’s spent a lifetime of spelling her last name and watching folks stumble over it.<BR>A cocktail reception was held earlier in the week at the beautiful Ruth Meyers store for the honorees, and I met Bonny Green for the first time there. She recently joined Oklahoma Hospitality Club as she moved here from Houston. She LOVES Oklahoma City. She recounted that she was in a clothing store right after moving here. The salesperson, after a brief chat, said, “I know some people you need to know. Can I give them your phone number?” The “some people” were members of Hospitality Club, and now Bonny has a whole new group of friends. That’s Oklahoma for you!<BR>•An artist reception was given by the Howell Gallery for the vividly colorful works of artist Aleta Pippin. Those admiring her work and visiting were Mark Yearwood, John McKee, Gennie and Bob Johnson, Dawn Rutledge, Francie Hart, Sara Branscom, Lori and Dodge Hill, Betty and Jim Bruce and Carole Sue Broughton.<BR>One of our own, Richard Rosser has launched “Piggy Nation” – a book for kids and a squealing great musical. Richard, son of Linda and the late Ron Rosser, grew up in Oklahoma City. His household (you KNOW Linda) was filled with books and music, so it was a natural that after his graduation from Washington and Lee, and a Master of Fine Arts in Film Production from New York University, he headed to Hollywood. We’ve all followed him through the years of the TV series, “24,” many other adult series and now he’s charming children. <BR>After watching a man steal a parking space from his mother-in-law, he decided, “Enough is enough!” No more drivers parking in two spaces, no more dogs pooping on neighbors’ lawns, no more leaving the toilet seat up, no more reading or texting while driving! “Piggy Nation” launched with “Piggy Nation The Musical,” premiered at the Pierson Playhouse in Pacific Palisades, Ca.<BR>The main character is a piglet named Sammy who joins his dad on Piggy Patrol. As they search the town for piggies, Sammy observes many examples of rude behavior, some quite unexpectedly. Think this may be right on my reading level!<BR>During the design process, Richard began reading his book to elementary school classes, which led to performing assemblies for larger groups of students. The kids responded so positively that it inspired Richard to adapt the story into a full-length musical with 12 songs and a cast of 20! Expanding on the children’s book, he added elements of romance and intrigue. Hmmmm, this would be worth seeing, porcine passion. Clearly a funny and brilliant guy like his parents, you may be sure this is a romp in the park.<BR>Though currently on a shoot for “The Mentalist,” he will be at Full Circle Book Store in OKC on May 1, at 10 a.m. for their Children’s Hour – followed by book autographing. What a delight – be sure to take the little people in your life for this lively adventure.<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>Now, going to the extreme: After you’ve screwed up and are lost in the woods while traveling, do not leave your vehicle. Call a tow truck. At night, light the candle you brought and place it in the small can you brought (you did that, didn’t you?) It provides comforting light and a teensy bit of heat.</div>
