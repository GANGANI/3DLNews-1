	Jesse Kain Cowan
	1975-2024
	• • • • •
	We want to honor the life of Jesse Kain Cowan, a cherished husband, father, son, brother, and friend, who departed from this world on March 29, 2024, at the age of 49. Jesse was born on February 3, 1975, in San Diego, California, and grew into a selfless man of exceptional kindness, intellect, courage, and humor. He passed away in Edmond, Oklahoma, surrounded by the love of his family and friends.
	Jesse, affectionately known as "the comedian of the family," leaves behind his devoted wife, Gena Cowan, and their three beautiful children, Garrett (Soffia Post), Jackson, and Chloe. He was a beloved son to Debi (Larry Noey) Lindsey and David (Nikki) Assad, son-in-law to Wayne Rankin, and a brother to a large and loving family, including Rabi Assad, Caesaré Assad, Nikki Rader-Assad, JC (Kelly) Johnson, Clay Johnson, Cody (Brandon) Cross, and AJ Hamill. Jesse's role as an uncle brought him immense joy and laughter, cherished by Aja, Neiko, Ryan, Alíce, Leilani, Brooke, Dylan, and Erick. His cherished friends and family were held closely in his heart, a testament to the deep bonds he forged throughout his life.
	Jesse's academic journey led him to achieve Master's degrees in Business and Banking, showcasing his intellect and dedication. Jesse attended OSU and was a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. His professional life was marked by significant contributions to his community, where he excelled as a mentor, volunteer, and leader. Although his career achievements are numerous, each chapter was defined by his commitment to serving others and advocating for the betterment of his community.
	Beyond his professional pursuits, Jesse found joy in many passions. His love for Oklahoma State University football and beach vacations was matched only by his dedication to his family and friends. He delighted in sharing these experiences with loved ones, creating lasting memories with his feet in the warm sand. Jesse also enjoyed playing video games with Garrett and Jackson, watching Chloe's cheerleading performances, indulging in pedicures, reading novels, and exploring topics of science fiction and geopolitics.
	Jesse's unparalleled sense of humor and wit brought light to every room he entered. His ability to make others laugh and his playful spirit endeared him to all who knew him. Jesse's calm demeanor, kindness, and approachability made him a true friend and mentor, and his legacy of laughter and joy will endure in the hearts of those he touched.
	In every aspect of his life, Jesse demonstrated courage and integrity. Whether facing life's challenges or advocating for causes he believed in, he did so with unwavering strength and humility, inspiring others to follow his example.
	As we reflect on Jesse's life, we remember a man of great character and boundless heart. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life, to listen and offer support, made him a beacon of light in the lives of many.
	In his 49 years, Jesse Kain Cowan left an indelible mark on this world. While we mourn his passing, we also celebrate the extraordinary life he led and the countless ways in which he enriched our lives. Jesse's legacy will continue to live on through the memories we cherish and the love he shared with each of us.
	As we bid farewell to Jesse, we take comfort in knowing that his spirit will always be with us, guiding and inspiring. He will be remembered not just for the life he lived, but for the love he gave and the joy he brought into our lives. Jesse Kain Cowan, a man of great character and boundless heart, will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.
	A service celebrating Jesse’s life was at 2 p.m. on Monday, April 8 at Crown Heights United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City.

	Judge Frank Miskovsky, II (July 24, 1907 – June 13, 1968) was a first generation American of Bohemian-speaking parents Frank and Mary (Bourek) Miskovsky who emigrated from Czech-Bohemia.  Judge Miskovsky was the eldest of seven children and grew up in an industrious family of the Miskovsky grocery story on 23rd and Drexel in Oklahoma City.  
	­A graduate of Central High School in 1925 and the University of Oklahoma in 1928, Miskovsky he worked in ranching, oil, Claims Investigator for a law firm, and bailiff at Oklahoma County Judge George Giddings to help his widowed-mother help raise his younger siblings during the Depression.  As a Bailiff in the mid-1930s, Miskovsky’s duties as a bailiff  included milking the cows of deliberating jurors who brought them to the lawn of the courthouse.  
	During this time, Miskovsky studied law at night at the then-Oklahoma City College of Law.
	In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Miskovsky was called to active duty and served in the Army Air Corp (predecessor to the U.S. Air Force)  in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps (JAG) until 1946.  After his war-time service, Miskovsky returned to private practice and remained in the Reserves in the Air Force until 1954 with the rank of Major.  During this time, he served as the National Secretary of the Air Reserve Association.  
	
		
	
		
		
			
	In 1950, he joined his brother, State Senator George Miskovsky in the firm of Miskovsky & Miskovsky.  In 1960, Miskovsky started his own firm and at times served as co-counsel with friend and future Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Marion Opala.  Notably, Miskovsky represented the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes against the U.S. Government in one of the biggest court victories for a tribe at the time.  While running his own firm, Miskovsky also served as a Special Judge in Oklahoma County, until later being elected to District Judge for Oklahoma County in 1967.  
	A life-long Democrat and longtime member of the Nichols Hills Methodist Church, Judge Miskovsky also served as the Post Commander for the American Legion in Oklahoma City and a member of the Oklahoma City Masonic Lodge #36.  
	Judge Miskovsky married the love of his life, Goldie ("GoGo”) B. Miskovsky in 1931 in Chickasha, OK and owned one of the first homes in Nichols Hills, a ranch in Piedmont, and a home in Crested Butte, Colorado.  He is survived by a son Frank Miskovsky, III and daughter-in-law   Gladys Ann (Simon) Miskovsky, and grandchildren Frank Miskovsky, IV (and great-grandchild Mary Elizabeth), Travis Miskovsky (spouse Katy Cowden-Miskovsky and great-grandchildren Madison, Emory, and Jake), and granddaughter Nicole Miskovsky-Gifford (and her husband Robert D. Gifford, II). He is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City next to his beloved wife Goldie (October 25, 1905 – December 7, 2000).

		Gladys Ann Miskovsky
		July 9, 1949 - March 7, 2023
		• • • • •
		Gladys Ann Miskovsky, 73, went to be with our Lord and Savior on Tuesday, March 7, 2023 in Oklahoma City with her husband, Frank III, and her son, Frank IV by her bedside. She was born in Wichita, Kansas to Armelda and Ned Murad Simon on July 9, 1949. She married the love of her life, Frank III, in 1968. The two were inseparable and recently celebrated 54 years of marriage.
	Above all, a devoted wife, mother and grandmother who delighted in cooking for her family and friends; allowing no one the slightest opportunity to ever leave her kitchen hungry. She wore many hats as a wife and mother and could always be found in the stands in support of every, single athletic performance of all three of her children.
	Gladys loved the outdoors and made many memories with Frank and the kids in Colorado and loved to fish and water ski at Lake Texoma.
	Gladys attended Nichols Hills Elementary, John Marshall High School, The University of Oklahoma and former Central State University. She began her real estate career with Truman Miller and obtained her broker license while serving as vice president of Churchill Brown and later formed her own brokerage company. She was also proud to serve as president of the Oklahoma Bar Auxiliary in the mid 1970s.
	Growing up, Gladys was the pretty, blond-haired, little girl who loved girly things but she could also out-kick and out-throw a football or baseball farther than any boy her age in the neighborhood. Her best stories and fondest memories of her childhood were about her travels to Marlow, Okla. with her little brother to visit their maternal aunts and uncles affectionately known as the "Gandy Clan.”
	Gladys received world-class care at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas and was cared for by surgeon, Dr. Keith Fournier with whom she became great friends. She also received tremendous support from Dr. Van Morris, Houston, Texas and Dr. Brian Geister, Oklahoma City with special appreciation and thanks to her nurse, Ashley Nguyen, who cared for Gladys with empathy and compassion at Integris Cancer Institute in Oklahoma City. Gladys fought cancer for close to five years with incredible courage and stoicism. Her strength, love of life and love for her family will endure forever.
	She is survived by her husband, Frank III, sons, Frank IV and Travis; daughter Nicole and their respective spouses all of Oklahoma City; grandchildren Madison, Emory, Jake, Mary Elizabeth and Dylan; sister, Gaynelle Seager and brother, Dr. Ron Simon along with many nieces, nephews and loving, life-long friends. Gladys is preceded in death by her parents and oldest brother, Tommy Ned.

	Joan Gilmore McLaughlin
	1927-2022
	• • •
	Joan Gilmore McLaughlin passed away in Oklahoma City on May 9, 2022, just days short of her 95th birthday. Born in 1927 to Helen and Joseph Gilmore, Joan spent most of her childhood in Waukegan, Ill., along with her brother Robert. Joan graduated from Drury University in Springfield, Mo. with a degree in English. 
	Joan began her career as a journalist with a weekly column in The Drury Mirror, the college newspaper, and then wrote for the town newspaper in Springfield. She moved to Oklahoma in 1952 where she joined the staff of the state’s largest newspaper, The Daily Oklahoman and its sister paper, The Oklahoma City Times. First a reporter in the society department, she worked her way into the position of women’s news editor with a staff of eight women. Joan met her husband Al McLaughlin at The Daily Oklahoman where he was director of the photo department. Joan left the paper after 28 years to open a public relations and videography business with her husband. She later completed her career as a daily columnist for The Journal Record, where she wrote about Oklahoma people and activities for more than 32 years.
	Joan had a deeply rooted passion for journalism and a love of the arts. Her dedication to volunteerism was manifested by her involvement with a myriad of civic groups and nonprofit organizations. She was also an esteemed advisor and mentor to many young women. She served as a founding member of Leadership Oklahoma City and Oklahoma Children’s Medical Research Foundation (now Oklahoma Children’s Hospital Foundation). Joan served on numerous boards, including the Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra, Ballet Oklahoma, the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, Friends of the OU Breast Institute, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, and the Executive Service Corps of Central Oklahoma. Her many awards and honors included Lifetime Achievement Awards from The Journal Record and the Oklahoma City chapter of The Association for Women in Communications. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Women’s Hall of Fame. Joan received a Special Award as well as a Media in the Arts Award from the Governor’s Arts Award program.
	Joan is survived by her stepson and daughter-in-law, Steve and Lisa McLaughlin; grandchildren, Catherine McLaughlin and Mark McLaughlin and his wife Angela; along with great grandchildren, Hannah and Jack McLaughlin. She also is survived by nephews, Tim Gilmore and Robert Gilmore; as well as a niece, Robin Gilmore Diefenbach. She was preceded in death by her husband, parents and brother.
	We will never know the full extent of Joan’s impact during her nearly 95 years; she touched countless lives in many different ways. Her involvement with groups and organizations, as well as her many awards and recognitions, tell only a small part of the colorful life and story of Joan. Although she has passed away, her influence will last for generations, especially for women for whom she fought so hard to empower.
	Memorial donations in Joan’s name may be made to NewView Oklahoma, 4301 N Classen Blvd, Oklahoma City, Okla., 73118.
	A memorial will be held at 3 p.m. on Saturday, May 14, 2022 at the Smith & Kernke Chapel, 14624 N. May Ave. and on www.smithandkernke.com.
	Joanie, you will be deeply missed.
