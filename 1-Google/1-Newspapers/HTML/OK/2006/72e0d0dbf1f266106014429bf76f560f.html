<div>I'd laughed so hard by the time I'd shuttled from the airport to the Dayton Marriott Hotel, going home even then would have left me fulfilled. I was to attend the Erma Bombeck Writers' Workshop at the University of Dayton.<BR>Recognizing that introducing myself to my four shuttle companions was the first step in making friends, I did so. We briefly covered our vocations (greeting card writer, stand-up comic, columnist, and marketer) and segued oddly into our pets. Brendon, wearing a leather cowboy hat, seemed a likely candidate for horses, so I asked if he just left them to graze. His scoff let me know I was a city slicker.<BR> "Arizona's lack of rain leaves them with quarter-inch high grass. So, no, I leave them with a feeding machine." He went on to explain how, like the appliances one sees that drops measured food down at intervals for dogs and cats, he had one that chopped and dropped hay cubes eight times a day. From the back of the shuttle bus, I heard Cheryl affirm, "Yeah, I left that for my husband too."<BR>I had a new best friend.<BR>Dinner and keynote speaker Dave Barry filled the first delightful evening. Before the salad arrived, we identified ourselves by what we wrote, "Computer manuals, columnist, non-profit newsletter, books, and one insisted the lady next to her was a stripper -- but a writer, too." With some 300 attendees, anything was possible!<BR>Dave Barry was lovable and bemoaned his early book signings when people approached the table where he was sitting. It was piled high with books featuring his picture, and folks would say, "Did you write this book?" When nobody would show up for the signings, in an effort to soothe his feelings, the book store owner would insist, "It's always dead this time of year" -- Dave was a little suspicious as it was mid December!<BR>A Florida-living Dave owned a dog he had trained to make an early-morning run out the back screen door. The dog would dance around just waiting for that screen door to open. "Now? Now? I just can't wait" was the bouncing posture. Hurricane Andrew zipped through and took off the back screened-in porch, except for the screen door and frame. Mind you, there is nothing left standing except the door. Dave doubted the pedigree of his pooch when the dog bounced up and down barking and waiting for Dave to open the door.<BR>Sharing our choices for the afternoon sessions, one new friend said, "I was going to attend this one (pointing to the schedule), but I saw him walking down the hall, and he didn't look very funny."<BR>The sessions were fabulous! My first experience was Dr. Mark Shatz, humor writer, standup comic, professor, and an expert on Thanatology (the study of death and the psychology and social problems associated with dying). Yikes! <BR>Holding up two round quilted bar stool covers with elastic banded backs, in minutes we were to come up with other uses for such an item. My sister-in-law, Susie Richardson, now living in Abiquiu, N.M., and the reason I knew of this conference, immediately decided they would make great earmuffs for Mickey Mouse. Another shouted out that one could be a gecko's trampoline, yet another, a condom package for a really confident man. The group was beyond wacky.<BR>When Mark threw out an exercise giving us total permission to be ridiculous with the premise of who would be the LEAST likely candidate for body piercing or body modification. This IS a family newspaper. Suffice it to say that the tamest offering was "a group of Amish on a field trip to South Beach."<BR>Leigh Anne Jasheway-Bryant, a speaking resource and a freelance humor writer, also does stand-up comedy. She ran us through zany exercises that really stretched our giggle muscles. We had one minute to write down as many observations in the room as we could. Next, five minutes to do "one liners" about them. My favorite observation was, "Why is wallpaper always in vertical stripes? Are walls afraid horizontal stripes will make them look fat?"<BR>I was thrilled by sessions on writing for greeting cards, secrets of writing for magazines, human-interest stories - resource Kelley Benham was a tremendous speaker, publishing, and a session on "Benefits of Self-Publishing" in which the speaker said the biggest circulation in the tens of thousands with his company is a book title, The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush. That has Christmas present written all over it.<BR>One new friend at lunch, Linda, was a gentle, pretty, and serene blonde who writes beautifully (I read excerpts) about youth, religion and self-esteem. Wanting to write humor, her animation revved in describing her chickens! A childhood love of chickens was supported when her husband agreed to a flock of five in a glorified, painted backyard doghouse/coop. She wrote, "When you pull down the door, there is a rung for the chickens to get their grip so they don't slide down and get discombobulated." At Target, she purchased a sign that warned, "Watch your step," and nailed it below the rung.<BR>Linda informed me, "Chickens are very observant. They'll come up to me looking at a freckle on my arm, cocking their yellow wobble things back and forth, little chicken heads bobbing as if to say --  'Oh, will you look at that!' then they'll do the same thing 20 seconds later." "So", she added, "Every time they come out of the coop they stand looking at that sign as if they are reading it and reminding each other. They are very literate chickens."<BR>Wish I had space to write of everything, but suffice it to say that this excellent conference, was run by Tim Bete, director of the Erma Bombeck Writer's Workshop, and held every other year. Erma Bombeck attended Ohio's Dayton University. The premiere of the documentary, Erma Bombeck: A Legacy of Laughter was our treat. Attending the workshops were Erma's husband, Bill, and her three adult children, who were very friendly and approachable.<BR>After dinner the last night, was "Attendee Stand-Up Comedy." Seven of these folks had never done this before, and seven were active in comedy in their regions. Brave and adorable, they flipped out lines like pros. "PMS makes me cranky, and I'm not too fond of the rest of the alphabet, either!" a Girl Scout leader about her troop and badges, "Seems to me that regarding the 'craft' badge, there should be a seven-day waiting period after applying for a glue-gun." And, "My Scout troop, during our stay at the Holiday Inn, qualified for their ‘hotel mini-bar’ patch.”<BR>Darn! Ran out of space and I didn't get to tell you about the sweet lady who wore a 30-inch soft-sculpture Nemo hat the entire time, the svelte lady who we constantly found in pretzel-y yoga poses in the restroom, the hall, and in the ballroom, and the guy who carried a quart bottle of something that looked like swamp water, but was comprised of "au jus" of dandelion, carrot and broccoli.<BR>	<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>Jim MacKellar has a warning: If you're going abroad to tramp through castles, ruins, etc. -- do it while you're young. It seems that most of those pesky old kings and emperors didn't have elevators! How could that be? And the climbing gets tough as we mature, so go now.<BR><BR></div>
