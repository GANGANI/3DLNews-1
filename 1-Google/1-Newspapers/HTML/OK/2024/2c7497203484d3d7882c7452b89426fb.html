	Earlier this month Classen School of Advanced Studies at Northeast, 3100 N. Kelley Ave., was named Oklahoma’s Best High School by U.S. News and World Report, but a Change.org petition signed by over 961 individuals is requesting the removal of the school’s principal Dr. Misti Tope.
	The petition and community comments on the Change.org petition express concerns about Dr. Tope’s decisions and behavior as a leader at Oklahoma City Public Schools. 
	The petition cites concerns that Dr. Tope is leading the school in the wrong direction, racism, cuts to athletic programs, firing teachers indiscriminately and the discontinuation of the JROTC program among many others.
	This school year Classen SAS at Northeast had an enrollment of 743 students in grades 9-12. The school is an application school, meaning students are not zoned for this school with student attendees from throughout the Oklahoma City metro area including other school districts. 
	Students apply to attend the school and are selected using test scores, interviews and/or auditions. Numerous Fridayland students attend the prestigious school.
	"District leaders have been made aware of a petition circulating in the CSAS@NE community,” said Kendall Still, Instructional Leader-ship Director and Dr. Melanie Mouse, Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education for OKCPS in a message sent to faculty and staff. "With misinformation being shared, we wanted to provide some clarity related to programs at CSAS@NE.
	"There will not be any cuts to athletic programs for the 2023-2024 school year and that decision is not dependent upon the site principal,” the message said. "The school will continue to offer softball, football, cross-country (boys and girls), volleyball, basketball (boys and girls), cheer, pom, esports, baseball, soccer, (boys and girls), tennis (boys and girls), golf (boys and girls) and track (boys and girls).”
	Administrators did say there will be a change for the school’s JROTC citing the Department of Defense requirement that host schools maintain participation levels of 10 percent of the student body, or 100 students which ever is less. CSAS@NE would need at least 80 students enrolled to receiving funding for instruction administered by the military department. The school has 47 students enrolled for the 2024-25 school year.
	"There are multiple layers at play, including the requirements of the Department of Defense for a funded (JROTC) program,” the message continued. "At this time district officials have evaluated the impact of this decision on students, staff and families and believe it is in the best interest to allocate the necessary staffing to provide a high-quality experience. Therefore, we will continue to offer JROTC in the same, full-time fashion that has existed in the past on site.”
	The district has also had issues with teacher funding saying, "Prior to the pandemic, our district, like many other public school districts, worked in creative ways to provide instruction and resources for our students. We were all doing this while operating on school budgets that were less than sufficient to meet the varied and complex needs of our students.
	"The pandemic brought new and unexpected challenges but was accompanied by federal stimulus dollars. The funds were intended to address the new challenges schools were facing while stabilizing their budgets” they said. "OKCPS used the funds to do just that as we implemented new programs, brought on additional staff, and stabilized an underfunded budget for the last three years. Unfortunately, the funds will be depleted and must be spent by June 30 of this year.”
	The district has implemented "difficult but necessary” steps to continue funding teacher pay but say, "It’s important to note that none of these steps involve terminating or reducing the pay of any employee.”
	A parent of a disgruntled student said that on May 5 some students "cornered Tope in her office due to her overall behavior and the school had to call in backup resource officers.’
	The parent also said, "A post in the GroupMe chat was calling for students to host a violent protest and walkout on Monday, May 6.”
	"District leaders are aware of a planned student led walkout related to concerns with school leadership,” Kendall Still and Dr. Melanie Mouse said in their message. "While OKCPS supports our students’ right to peacefully assemble, this issue is not a social or political issue. A student walkout to address concerns with a principal or any employee is inappropriate and unacceptable.
	"Students who participate could face disciplinary actions,” they continued. "The appropriate way to express and voice concerns with school and district issues is by following our ‘Steps to Resolution’ protocol.”
	OKCPS Administrators did not respond to racism accusations.
	Dr. Misti Tope has been employed with Oklahoma City Public Schools since 2015 and has served as a Drama Teacher and Instructional Coach at Taft Middle School, Assistant Principal at Classen School of Advanced Studies at Northeast from 2020-2023 and Principal from 2023. The school has one principal and two assistant principals.
	School officials contend the individuals behind the petition have not been able to provide evidence of any of the claims being made and that everything reported to the school and district has been investigated.

	Two Oklahoma City barbershoppers, Greg Rogers and Mark Winn, attended the Southwestern District Spring Convention in Dallas, Texas, to qualify for international competition. Rogers and Winn co-direct the award-winning Vocal Sounds of Oklahoma, a men’s barbershop chorus of the Oklahoma City Chapter.
	Rogers sings with his quartet, OverDrive, the 2023 Southwestern District Overall Quartet Champion and 2023 Men’s Quartet Champion. OverDrive scored an 82.0 and qualified for the 2024 Barbershop Harmony Society International Convention quartet competition in Cleveland Ohio this July. This marked the first time since 1971 that an Oklahoma City based quartet qualified for international competition, the last OKC-based quartet to do so was 53 years ago by OK-4. 
	OverDrive quartet members include Rogers (lead), Joe Krones (bass), Philip Sense (bari), and Tyler Wilson (tenor). OverDrive is OKC-based.
	Winn sings with his quartet called Red River Runners, a Top 10 Finalist at the 2023 Southwestern District quartet competition. Red River Runners won the 2024 Senior Quartet Championship and became an International Senior Quartet Qualifier for the 2025 Barbershop Harmony Society Mid-Winter International Convention quartet competition to be held in San Antonio Texas in January 2025. 
	Red River Runners quartet members include Winn (tenor), Mark Holdeman (bari), Rick Robertson (bass), and Larry Thomason (lead). Red River Runners is OKC/DFW-based. 
	"The reigning Southwestern District overall quartet champion  Southwestern District men’s quartet champion,and Southwestern District senior quartet champion are all connected to the Oklahoma City Chapter and we are so very proud of both OverDrive and Red River Runners representing not only Oklahoma City, but also Oklahoma as they prepare for these upcoming international events,” stated Lester Claravall, president of the Vocal Sounds of Oklahoma. "In 2022, under the direction of Rogers and Winn, the Vocal Sounds of Oklahoma won the Southwestern District Men’s Chorus Championship,” said Claravall.
	What a lot of people in Oklahoma do not realize is that the Barbershop Quartet, a four-part harmony in a cappella, originated in Tulsa, leading to the formation of the Barbershop Harmony Society on April 11, 1938, Claravall said. From Tulsa, the art form took a life of its own leading to barbershop chapters being chartered across the United States and around the world. 
	The Oklahoma City Chapter (Vocal Sounds of Oklahoma) was chartered on July 6, 1938 and became the third oldest chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society. The Oklahoma City Chapter, a 501c3 organization with an 86-year history, currently has a membership of 40-plus men of all ages and all walks of life who enjoy singing barbershop whether as a men’s barbershop chorus or as barbershop quartets.

	Officials in Nichols Hills have approved a Coyote Management Plan in case residents have issues with coyotes wandering into the city and their neighborhood.
	The nine-page document was developed using information obtained from the Humane Society of the United States and covers reasons coyotes are attracted to urban areas including food, water, access to shelter.
	The management plan was requested by council member Steve Goetzinger following reports of coyotes in the city.
	The document encourages residents to never hand-feed or intentionally feed a coyote, never feed pets outdoors, store all pet food securely indoors, secure all trash containers with locking lids, clean up fallen fruit around trees and remove bird feeders or clean fallen seed to reduce the presence of small mammals that coyotes prefer to eat.
	 "I don’t believe we’ve had many complaints about coyotes recently,” said City Manager Shane Pate during the May 14 city council meeting. "We had a complaint filed a year or two ago, and then seasonally we would receive notice of a coyote.”
	The document says most coyotes weigh 25-235 pounds, although their long legs and thick fur make them appear larger. Since coyotes are naturally very skittish and afraid of humans, they are rarely seen. Thus, their signs including prints, scat and vocalizations may be a better indicator of their presence.
	Coyote prints are similar to those of a domestic’ dogs but are usually observed in a straight line as opposed to the meandering path of domestic dog tracks. More commonly, coyote howling, or other vocalizations may be heard.
	The document goes on to state coyotes are naturally diurnal (most active at dawn and dusk), but often shift to more nocturnal activity in urban and suburban areas in an effort to avoid people. 
	Coyotes prefer open space and natural preserve areas over human-dominated landscapes but are extremely adept at living in proximity to peoples. Coyotes thrive in these areas because foo0d, water and shelter are abundant.
	"We encourage residents to call our animal welfare department if they have a coyote sighting to report,” said Pate. "Or call WildCare Oklahoma if after the city’s business hours. The Coyote Management Plan also has a form you can fill out to help us track and manage their whereabouts.”
	The Nichols Hills Coyote Management Plan is available to view on the city’s website nicholshills-ok.gov..

	By Mike Ray
	Former OKC FRIDAY News Editor
	
		
	One of the highlights of my so-far 55-year career in journalism occurred three and a half decades ago when Leland Gourley hired me to be his news editor at OKC FRIDAY. At the time I was between jobs (a euphemism for "out of work”).
	Oklahoma City scheduled a general obligation bond issue in 1989 that included a multitude of projects. I asked Mr. Gourley if we could print the entire list of proposed projects, along with a story relating the typical details (the date of the election, the amount of the bonds, the payoff period, the cost per thousand dollars of assessed valuation, etc.). As I recall, Leland had a three word reply: "Go for it.”
	The story and the laundry list of projects filled an entire broadsheet page of OKC FRIDAY. Ultimately we produced more coverage of that bond issue than The Oklahoman did. The proposal passed.
	One day I asked Mr. Gourley why he founded OKC FRIDAY. It was not, and still is not, a "typical” newspaper. Instead, it is packed primarily with stories and photos about activities of "the beautiful people” of Nichols Hills. Leland replied, "Rich people like to see their names and photographs in print, too.” Until then, a point I had never considered.
	Leland Gourley was an award-winning, seasoned journalist. But he was also a shrewd businessman, as demonstrated by OKC FRIDAY’s recent celebration of its well-deserved 50th anniversary.
