<div>This is an amazing column, and you may even learn something new. Learn something? From Joy’s column? My brain is not blonde, so I may just surprise you!<BR>Sitting down with new mother, Jen Barth, you’re struck by what a charming and pretty, but wise and focused young woman she is. Jen is married to Lee Barth, son of Gene and Ed Barth. Like many newlyweds, after a couple of years they decided to start their family. Young and healthy, but no pregnancy occurred. A pro-active woman, Jen consulted her doctor and got the advice, “Relax, take a vacation and try for a couple of years.” Jen sought the advice of another doctor who did the necessary tests and found that Jen did not have the physical architecture to maintain a pregnancy if it did occur, and it would be a high-risk situation. <BR>Always planning a family, this was sad news to Jen and Lee, who then had to consider alternatives. They felt very alone when they pondered “surrogacy” -- who does that? Is it weird? Where do we find the “carrier?” Jen described the surrogate as “an oven,” because Jen’s egg, and Lee’s sperm were to be mixed in a Petri dish! Her baby was kind of a science experiment. Another mind picture is this scenario: You have flowers to grow, but you don’t have a garden. So, you plant your flowers in someone else’s garden plot. I was awed by Jen’s frank nature, lack of reserve about the process, and her scientific interest. Funny thing is, Jen IS modest. But she also is altruistic, and wants to help other couples through this process if they are considering it, and therefore let me write of it.<BR>One blessing is that the Barths live in California where the laws are very sensible regarding surrogacy. In some states IF you go through the process, the laws require that after the birth you have to fill out the paperwork to adopt the child created by your egg and sperm. Insurance coverage can be an issue, and if you live in New York, you have to go to New Jersey for the doctor to do the procedure, and to Pennsylvania to find a surrogate. Though the process has been around since the 1970s, it hasn’t been practiced widely until the last 8-10 years. Jen and Lee searched their souls to see if this was the right thing for them, it is not a walk in the park. They really really wanted a child, and other than Jen not being able to carry one, there was no reason not to try.<BR>Mental, physical, and extensive background evaluations and exhaustive psychological testing are required. Jen educated herself through the Internet and a lot of reading. Talking with a surrogacy group, she and Lee filled out an application to find a “match.” Getting a call, they were nervous. Jen said, “I’d never even been on a blind date in my life -- and here we’re talking about meeting someone to carry our child!” On their first “phone date,” they discovered that their surrogate is a mom of two children, and teaches eighth grade science. She’d once done a study of “In Vitro Fertilization,” and decided if she could ever help another woman become a mother, she would.<BR>It was love at first sight! They meshed. Jen felt comfort with this kind and happy lady, and loved watching her with her children, husband, and the large close-knit support group she had. “Actually, I didn’t even make a decision,” Jen said, “It just happened.” Of course Jen and Lee looked for “signs” that this was a right decision. Lee’s dog from childhood, Julius, was just about like a human being to them, but was in failing health. Returning from the first surrogacy meeting, they found the dog had passed away. That reasoning may hit you wrong, but to the Barths and to me, it was kind of the cycle of life. Of course Jen and Lee went through all the normal emotions -- would the surrogate change her mind? Would she treat her body with great care? What if she were in a car wreck? -- all the fears anyone would have. <BR>Papers were signed, tests were completed, and the implantation occurred -- would it “take”? It did, and Jen and Lee went for the surrogate’s first doctor visit a few weeks later. “You have one beautiful baby!” he pointed out on the ultrasound. Two weeks later Jen went for the next prenatal visit, the only one that Lee missed. “Jen,” the doctor ordered, “Sit down.” Of course Jen was panicked. “We’ve grown another baby,” the doctor said. <BR>Now, not being familiar with the process, I thought many pregnancies that occurred outside the usual procedure, were multiple. That often is true. But this was Jen’s egg, and it split into two. Both babies were in one sac, so they were identical. They knew so much about this pregnancy because it was so closely monitored. There’s a window in which an egg split can form conjoined twins. But this egg split was before that, the magic 3-4 days after they first saw the ultrasound, and all was perfect. The surrogate was cautioned not to lift anything more than six pounds -- she had a 2-year-old. Her support group rallied. Jen saw her quite often, e-mailed, called, and they became fast friends. The worry with identical twins is twin-to-twin transfusion, perhaps vying for food, even injuring each other. “Fraternal twins are like sharing a two-bedroom apartment,” laughed Jen. “ But these girls are sharing a studio apartment!” This was just a genetic fluke.<BR>Being a high-risk pregnancy, the mom was told that Cedars Sinai was the hospital she needed. Then Jen had all new worries: Two hours back and forth for doctor visits for the surrogate -- would she give birth on the freeway? At a Taco Bell? Would she know she was even in labor, her first child had been induced, and the second a C-section.<BR>One day late into the pregnancy, the surrogate mom called apologetically, “I’m sure it’s nothing, but I feel a little funny.” “TO THE HOSPITAL, WE’LL MEET YOU THERE!” insisted the Barths. Arriving, they found she was ready to give birth. Generally twins are born around 35 weeks, and these were a little earlier, but they weighed 4 pounds 1 ounce, and 4 pounds 13 ounces. Jen said, “I was so focused on the process of fertility, that it blew my mind. OH, MY GOSH! I’m a MOM!”<BR>NOW THIS ONE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. Mom, Jen, is nursing the babies. A process called, “Induced Lactation” encourages a mother’s body to nurse -- go to the Internet -- you’ll see. Jen is so at home with her beautiful bundles, not a frantic mom in any sense, just practical, grateful, and loving. She says, “I forget I didn’t carry them, they are soooo OURS.” As twins, Jen sees one as laid back, and one intense, one is a little bit larger, but they are often in the exact same position in their cribs. Though they imagined the process of surrogacy would take years, in their case, the great match occurred and the twins were in their arms a year later. <BR>Jen and Lee have kept in close contact with the surrogate, and there have been visits. The surrogate had a “Sip and See” to show her family and support group the babies they helped nurture. Visiting with Jen it was apparent that if you are willing to do the research and homework, and find doctors who are in accord with your plans, infertility needn’t limit your life. Jen smiled sweetly when she talked of the blessing of this surrogate in her life, and her profound gratitude. All I can tell you is that there are two healthy, sweet little angels who look like Jen and Lee, adored by parents and grandparents, snoozing in cribs in Gene and Ed’s home.<BR>Jen has a website where she gave constant updates on the progress of this process, which is her gift to other couples who need information. It would give you someone to contact who has been through the same thing. E-mail me and I’ll get you in touch with Jen. She wishes she’d had someone to talk with, who had done this, when she went through the surrogacy program. But what a lovely outcome!<BR>	<BR>BIZARRE BEAUTY TIP<BR>We girls with big Oklahoma/Texas hair do some serious “backcombing.” I recently experimented with my cat’s clean fur comb. Supposedly it is called a “flea comb,” but absent of that, it really does a fantastic job of “ratting” your hair -- if you’re really retro and have a desire for that. A territorial kitty sent me to PetSmart to purchase my own, she wanted hers left alone. Other than occasionally washing my face with my paw, and a craving for tuna fish, I’ve no discernable aftereffects. <BR></div>
