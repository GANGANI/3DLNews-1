<div>Have you heard the juicy gossip? Through the grapevine I heard that Joanne Lytle is marrying Gregory Frogge, after having left Kit Greene, and Mike Kelly before that and Roy Lytle before that, and LeRoy Long before that: making her Joanne Lytle Long Kelly Greene Frogge! <BR>Not only that, but: Kathryn Crabb, moving through the range of earth-toned crustacean emotions, divorced Hal Brown, left Mark Mellow, after divorcing Brent Moody, and before that Larry Savage, making her Kathryn Savage Moody Mellow Brown Crabb!<BR> The most scandalous in the animal kingdom is that Suzanne Bugg left Jerry for Patrick Hare, leaving him for Darrell Beavers, and him for Jim Fox, and Jim for Bill Wolfe, moving up the food chain and ending up with Dennis Lyon, making her Suzanne Bugg Hare Beavers Fox Wolfe Lyon.<BR>Most occupationally confused was Linda Carpenter, who left Don for Steve Foerster, left him for Steve Hunter, and him for Ed Cook, married Mike Weaver, and landed Mike Brewer, making her the capable in many vocations: Linda Foerster Hunter Cook Weaver Brewer.<BR>It’s April Fool’s Day, and some of us have too much time on our hands. Please don’t think I’m making fun OF your names, just funnin’ WITH your names -- thanks for being good sports.<BR>•Dropping by to visit my mom in her nursing center, I found she was listening to devotionals. Not wanting to disturb that, I leaned back against the wall and waited outside the activity room.<BR>After the third person commented on what a good job I was doing of “holding up that wall,” I sauntered on down the hall and sat on an exercise mat in the Physical Therapy room. It gave me a view of her doorway.<BR>Knowing all the staff, we started chatting. They were talking about one resident who was 101, and her daughter in her 80s, who is also a resident. The 80-year old has a child in her 60s, who has one in her 40s, who has one in her 20s who has a child. That makes the 101-year-old cutie a great great great grandmother. <BR>We were musing on that when a new physical therapist whom I’d never seen strolled into the room. After exchanging a few remarks with his peers, he turned to me. Mind you, having just come from a luncheon, I had on tall pewter-colored heels, dangly earrings, a fitted silver jacket, full make-up, my hair wasn’t blue and was sitting on the floor mats having arrived there under my own power -- but he inquired, “Can I help you? Are you here for therapy?” And in no way was he kidding -- this is a NURSING home. That was painful! <BR>Guess I’m having a “mature matron” issue, which started last week.<BR>I decided to apply for Social Security early, as it seems possible that the system may go through major changes. Was that an adventure! Jerry went with me to Shepard Mall, as he wanted to be informed about the process.<BR>   Nestling ourselves onto the same straight back chairs that the pilgrims used for their four-hour church services, we surveyed the room. There was a Baskin-Robbins number dispenser mounted on a pole, but somehow my business didn’t qualify for that fancy machine -- after signing in, I just sat and waited. Jerry and I, to pass the time, played mind games with each other guessing who would be called next. <BR>We were a curiosity as he was in a sport coat, and I, having come from a meeting, was in a dress and my new foxy pink “Easter shoes” with the killer heels. Scanning the room, we realized that a bath and hair combing were optional. I’d heard horror stories about three- and four-hour waits, but it moved fairly quickly. People were there for all sorts of reasons, and it was a true cross section of our city -- reminiscent of the state fair. There were kids playing tag, those clipping their fingernails, some people snoozing and eight check-in windows processing folks.  (Practical tip No. 1 -- take something to read). <BR>My leap from the seat when my name was called would lead you to believe I’d won the lottery. But that didn’t mean a thing; I just had been culled down to wait for the next process. My “window person” was peppy and friendly, and even told me I didn’t look THAT old. I was warming to this!<BR>After about 40 minutes I was beckoned to the “back room.” The first thing the young lady asked was if there were any warrants out for my arrest? Was I on parole? Now come on, do lady parolees wear pink shoes with bows on them? Then I learned (Practical tip No. 2 -- you need your birth certificate). I had to sign affidavits attesting to the fact that I wasn’t lying. IF you were lying, would you lie about that?<BR>We discussed how to deposit the whole $1.47 in Social Security I’d receive each month and went home to the family Bible to find my birth certificate, which wasn’t there. Apparently I was never born -- what a shame, all those cute shoes will go to waste! The good old Internet gave us directions so I guess we’ll have to send off for it.<BR>•Okay, so this column is without substance -- but on April 1 what else would you expect? We all need some silliness in our lives. For the one humor-challenged reader who doesn’t find me funny, I assure you, I at least look like I am funny! <BR>Picture this: I’m curled up in my ergonomically posture correct chair pecking away at the computer keyboard, glasses perched on my nose, hair like a frightened squirrel, at 6 a.m., giggling like a tickled three-year-old as I extract wonderful last names from directories to make up absurd names -- I do LOOK really hilarious!<BR>	<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>Bloom where you are planted! Many are facing tough issues in their lives, but you can be their relief from the doldrums, if only for a minute. Call someone to say, “I’m thinking of you.” <BR>If you’re up for it, celebrate April 1 by stitching up the fly on your husband’s boxer shorts (that IS funny -- I did it) <BR>Leave the number of the OKC Zoo and insist your mate call back as a “Buffy Lowe” left a message. Unhuh, I did that too.<BR>Grandchildren are the best! You can get really ridiculous with stories about the moose in your swimming pool, you can invite them for dinner and serve green mashed potatoes, or disguise your voice and insist them they won a hippopotamus and when do they want it delivered. <BR>They adore wacky grandparents. It doesn’t take much to have fun!<BR></div>
