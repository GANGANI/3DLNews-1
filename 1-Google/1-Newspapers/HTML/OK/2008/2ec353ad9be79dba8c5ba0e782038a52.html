<div class="pageheading">Not the sharpest claw on the paw.</div><div class="pagebody">�Oh, drat! Bitsy got out�, lamented Camilla Ostrowe. Bitsy is petite, black and white, a much-loved kitty. A doting �cat mother,� Camilla characterizes her pet, �She�s the cutest and sweetest kitty, but not the smartest one I�ve ever seen.� (Along the lines of, �not the freshest mackerel in the can� or �not the sharpest claw on the paw�)</div><div class="pagebody">Going outdoors was not cataclysmic, as Bitsy has a lockable cat door, and often comes and goes at will. But it was evening and long-suffering Camilla waits up for the pets to be tucked in for the night, she compares it to waiting up for teenagers. When the next several days didn�t produce Bitsy, daughter Isabella was beside herself with worry, and in tears, so they called the Humane Society, animal rescue, asked the garbage men, and put up fliers. Growing disgruntled, they reasoned that maybe this ungrateful feline might have capriciously attached to another family. But they conceded to leaving the pet door open while they went out of town. Camilla said, �We usually keep it locked as we don�t want to wake up with some strange rabbit in our bed.�</div><div class="pagebody">Returning home six days later, no Bitsy. </div><div class="pagebody">Meanwhile, next-door neighbor, Marilyn Torbett was telling her friends that the neighborhood must be overrun with cats mating, as she constantly heard meowing. During an extensive renovation, the Torbetts were living in one small portion of their house. Marilyn must have gone through her nine lives when Bitsy poked her head up through a floor vent! </div><div class="pagebody">A contractor came over and asked the Ostrowes if they were the ones missing a cat. Rushing over and calling �Bitsy, Bitsy� down the vents, they heard the scratch, scratch of kitty nails in the air vents, and Isabella reached down and felt a tail. </div><div class="pagebody">Relieved at Bitsy�s rescue, but contrite, Camilla asked Marilyn if she owed anything for boarding their cat for a week. They surmise that she nocturnally lapped water from the toilets, and most likely put a dent in any mouse population in the Torbett�s vents during remodeling. An unruffled Bitsy huffed as Camilla carried her home, ate some cat food, and went outside to play again, unfazed by the whole adventure.</div><div class="pagebody">While Bitsy was doing her Christmas caper, the rest of us were spending our time outside of heating vents, and going to lots of holiday celebrations. </div><div class="pagebody">�For some 60+ years, the men�s Fortune Club has been having breakfast and a speaker, weekly, at OKC Golf and Country Club. At Christmas they invite their pretty ladies for a beautifully planned formal dinner dance. </div><div class="pagebody">Dressed in their finest were members and their wives, including Akiko and Max Knotts, Ann and Burns Hargis, Jane and Gerald Gamble, Sue Ann and Dudley Hyde, Lori and Bond Payne, and Louise and Clay Bennett. We applauded at the announcement that Clay was being designated the Oklahoma Today magazine�s �Person of the Year.�</div><div class="pagebody">Others were Lana and Dave Lopez, Alice and Bob Fitzpatrick (Bob writes the most articulate and well-done weekly newsletter. My dictionary sits right beside me when I read it -- does that man have a beautiful vocabulary!) Also attending were Donna and Governor George Nigh (what a pre-cious down-to-earth man he is!), Lark and Mark Dale, Susan and Steve Prescott, Billie and Bill Thrash, Olive and Jerry Austin, Susan and Carl Edwards, and Mary and Bill Price. In honor of much-loved B.C. Clark, Jr, the band struck up the B.C. Clark jingle and we all joined in.</div><div class="pagebody">�Inda Burchfiel and Janie Axton sent out an invitation that said, �Soup�s On!� -- and their many girlfriends came running. Since I just couldn�t decide between tortilla soup or chili -- I tried both -- FABULOUS! Inda must spend the whole month of November perfectly placing her beautiful Christmas collections, as her house is just charming and full of holiday spirit.</div><div class="pagebody">Sipping soup were Carol Taylor, Jessie Ann Wallentine, Janet Price, Sue Goodman, Linda Reece, Sharon Wade, Kathy Griffin, Nancy Kimberling, Darlene Parman, and Janet Hudson. </div><div class="pagebody">Greeting guests at the door of �Kanela & Company�s Holiday Party� were Kanela Huff and her daughter, Lisa Voegeli. With such a busy life, how does Kanela find time to decorate her home so perfectly?  </div><div class="pagebody">Seeing long-time friends at Kanela�s were Rawsie and Sonny Boyles, Dee and John Harris, Carolyn Wright, Gray Fredrickson, Bobby Dodd, Candy and Tom Dulaney, Jenny and David Kallenberger, Sue Magness, Sherry Furseth, Sue and Don Timberlake, and Carol Beard. Trying to resist the many tables full of great things to eat were Carolyn and Dan Stuart, Connie and Gary Fuller, Mary and Jerry Bostick, Tina and Dick Stubbs, Cordell Brown, Gracie Moyers, Tom King, Carleen and Jerry Burger.</div><div class="pagebody">�The FRIDAY newspaper Christmas party is always truly wacky. Helloooo? Consider the cast of characters! Granted, the food wasn�t funny -- it just incredible. Caterer Eli Embree was the source and his wife, Erin Fitzgerald Embree looked very proudly.</div><div class="pagebody">Vicki has a basket of Christmas headgear that is mandatory attire when you walk in the door -- so everyone looks equally silly, and that sets the tone. Vicki�s ornament decorated antlers dangled rakishly lopsided over her eyes, and Leland was a pretty credible Santa. Others were wacky snowflakes, trees and mitten-heads. Then there is the �dirty Santa� gift exchange. </div><div class="pagebody">Each couple brought two gifts, and it was obvious that the women did a lot of the choosing and wrapping -- Bob Lane (Rose�s husband) kept trying to �steal� his own gifts, much to Rose�s dismay. She was trying to get rid of those objects. She was thrilled when he unwrapped a �Ped Egg,� she�d wanted one. He was clueless as to its use, but, alas, it was gift-nabbed. The berserk singing-dancing dog was passed around many times before I managed to capture it. A Cowboy�s Night Before Christmas and the Redneck�s Night Before Christmas were big hits, brought by Sandy and Craig Case. Leland seemed content with his seasonal travel mug, but there was much �stealing� of an OU computer mouse, fragrance sets, holiday coffee, and vases.</div><div class="pagebody">	</div><div class="pagebody">NEW YEAR�S WISH</div><div class="pagebody">Dustin Hoffman declared in last week�s Parade, �Fun is my revenge against mortality.� Pesky life challenges keep cropping up for all of us, nobody is exempt, but if we can manage to find the humor in a situation, it diffuses the impact it makes. I learned that in a conversation with Deloris Bradford who had a week so frustrating that she could do nothing but laugh. GREAT ATTITUDE. So I wish you FUN, LAUGHTER, HUMOR, and PERSPECTIVE -- and the ability to find those in your everyday life in 2009.</div><div class="pageruler"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 0pt;">&nbsp;</span></div><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">GetSubMenuFooter79();</script></div>
