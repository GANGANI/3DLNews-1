<div>By J. LELAND GOURLEY<BR>Editor<BR>Oklahoma City begins a new year with an economy driven largely by a booming  energy industry, spearheaded by the largest independent oil and gas companies in America, whose corporate headquarters are, loyally, located here.<BR>In addition to energy, there is another major industry rising quietly, but competently and swiftly, bringing added economic diversity.<BR>This new industry, bio-technology,  is being led nationally now in San Fran-cisco, San Diego and Boston.<BR>Watch out! Oklahoma City is on the way!<BR>Behind its steering wheel, with his foot on the accelerator, is a former college basketball star and highly successful preacher, with an Edinburgh, Scotland University Doctor’s Degree in Theology. <BR>He is an accomplished scientist whose knowledge of  that field has been accepted by its long-time professionals.<BR>He is a dynamic leader with determination. optimism and uncanny vision.<BR>He is Michael Anderson, President and CEO of Presbyterian Health Foundation, and . . . .<BR>He is OKC FRIDAY’S selection as the “OKCityan of the Year, 2008.”<BR>He first came to Oklahoma from his New York job as Director of Mission Interpretation and Fund Raising for the World Mission of the United Presbyterian Church, to become Pastor of  Westminster Presbyterian Church.<BR>Under Mike’s leadership, Westminster grew to more than 2,600 members, many of them among the top civic leadership of Oklahoma City and the state.<BR>He grew up in Spokane, Washington. He attended Whitworth College there, where he was a basketball star while getting his bachelor’s degree.  His degree major was in philosophy and psychology, with minor in history and New Test-ament. This led him to the San Francisco Theological Seminary and then on to his Doctorate in Theology at Edinburgh University.<BR>Soon after coming to Oklahoma City he found himself in a myriad of community leadership roles and became widely sought as a public speaker.<BR>His church was located in the neighborhood of the Health Sciences Center and he developed relationships there.<BR>When the Presbyterian Health Foundation was launched, Anderson was one of the founding Directors. He was named President of the Foundation almost five years ago.<BR>During his time on the board, he was appointed to the Commission on Public Representation for the National Institute of Health (NIH). <BR>‘Mike can talk to business, science, health and education<BR>communities.’<BR>The Presbyterian Health Foundation, which Mike helped build, and now heads, has created PHF’s Research Park. <BR>The Park presently owns and occupies 23.5 acres plus and is acquiring an additional, adjoining 11 acres.<BR>It now has 6 huge buildings with a total of more than a million square feet now almost fully occupied with research facilities and start-up bio-tech companies.<BR>A seventh identical building is under construction and nearing completion. <BR>R.H. Caton, Park vice president says, “We’re operating under the theory that if we build it they will come.”<BR>More than 1,300 are employed at the Park with salaries averaging above $57,000.<BR>Hershel Lamirand, CEO of the Health Center Foundation says Anderson is involved in issuing grants and other aid to the other entities in the Health Sciences center.<BR>The Foundation has given more than $100 million in research grants, endowing chairs and aiding start-up commercial bio-tech companies from the transfer of research findings in the Center.<BR>The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation alone has received at least $4 million in PHF grants in the last three years, said Dr. Stephen Prescott, OMRF President.. He said a current grant of $500 thousand will help acquire a super state of the art research microscope.<BR>Presbyterian Foundation was started with private funding of about $70 million and received a much larger amount from the sale of Presbyterian Hospital.<BR>Anderson’s service on the NIH Commission enabled him to establish contacts to secure more federal funds. Dr. Joe Ferretti, Vice President and Provost of the OU Health Sciences Center, gives Mike credit for noting that Oklahoma was not getting its fair share of federal funding.<BR>Stanton Young, “father” of the Presbyterian Health Foundation, gives Mike credit for developing strong relationships with national health research leaders, all to the benefit of Oklahoma.<BR>“Mike has an incredible intellect,” Young said. “He reads a book in a day. He has an expert knowledge of health science.”<BR>The one attribute all the movers and shakers of the multi-unit Health Sciences Center credit to Anderson is his ability and drive to transfer bio-tech research knowledge into private commercial start-up companies.<BR>Young refers to it as Mike’s “burning desire.”<BR>Lamirand and Prescott each refer to it as Mike’s “passion. to transfer and get companies to going.”<BR>OMRF has spun off 12 companies from the research of its scientific investigators.<BR>A total of 50 bio-tech companies are now in the Park or have gone on through it.<BR>With Anderson’s enthusiasm and energy, the future is looking bright for  a huge increase in this new industry for Oklahoma.<BR>Ferretti describes Mike as “a terrific spokesman for the bio sciences.<BR>“He goes the extra mile to understand how he can transfer bio-tech research into economic growth.<BR>“He has helped us in funding endowed chairs and has made numerous research seed grants and bridge grants to hold over occasional grant losses for investigators.”<BR>Young said of Mike, “He has had an enormous impact on the development of the OU Health Sciences Center. While serving PHF he provided leadership responsible for the dramatic growth in NIH research at the OU  Center<BR>“While on the NIH commission, he had access to, and review of, the latest and most promising research. He participated with the Chamber in the annul Bio-Conference, where he could present the advantages of locating or relocating new start-up companies here.”<BR>David Boren, OU president, had this to say about Mike who served on the OU faculty:<BR>“Mike Anderson was one of the most popular professors that we have ever had at OU when he taught his courses here. Many students commented that he caused them to think more deeply about the meaning of their lives. We are grateful to Mike for giving of himself so generously to our students.”<BR>Roy Williams, President and CEO of the Greater OKC Chamber. said:<BR>“We have been blessed to have such a visionary leader at Presbyterian Health Foundation. His passion for research; his dedication to the support for this industry cluster and his communication skills made significant contributions to our quality of life and economic landscape.”<BR> Mike Anderson, cleric, and Mike Anderson, scientist, think each of these avenues have a lot in common, that they can work together.<BR>That philosophy has helped him greatly in dealing with the scientists he works with in funding and transfer of research to commercial enterprises.<BR>Mike Anderson’s education, intellect, and constant study have qualified him to communicate on an accepted level with all the communities of bio-technology, faith and business.</div>
