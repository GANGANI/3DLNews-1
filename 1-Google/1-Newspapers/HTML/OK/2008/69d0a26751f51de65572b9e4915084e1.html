<div>By VICKI CLARK<BR>OKC FRIDAY Executive Editor<BR>He’s not a hundred years old, not nearly, but for the past 50 years no one has done more to promote Oklahoma to the country and the world.<BR>“Lee Allan Smith makes you proud to be an Oklahoman,” said his friend from childhood, Bill Swisher.<BR>Lee Allan doesn’t even need a last name. Known nationwide as simply “Lee Allan.” <BR>During the past five years, Lee Allan orchestrated Oklahoma’s Centennial celebrations beginning with the grand reopening of the Civic Center Music Hall and The Dome Dedicator and culminating last November with the Centennial Parade and the Spectacular on statehood day.<BR>Never content with just Oklahomans knowing how great his native state is, Lee Allan negotiated and raised the money for Oklahoma Centennial floats in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for two years and the OU Band for the third and on the first day of 2007, two Oklahoma Centennial floats in the Pasadena Rose Bowl Parade plus the Oklahoma Centennial High School Band and the Oklahoma City University American Spirit Dance Company opening and leading the Rose Bowl Parade.<BR>Thirty-five years ago, he founded and produced the Stars and Stripes July 4th show. The last five years of the shows, which ran from 1969- 1976, were televised nationwide by NBC.<BR>“For a local affiliate production to be on the national network was real unusual in those days,” said Bill Thrash, now OETA’s Station Manager. (Lee Allan called Thrash the “technical genius” behind the Stars and Stripes shows.)<BR>“Lee Allan is the most visionary person I know. He inspires you to succeed as was proven this past year,” Thrash said.[Continued from Page 1]<BR>Born in Oklahoma City, Lee Allan was in seventh grade at Harding Junior High when news came his father had died tragically in an early morning hotel fire in Wichita Falls, Texas. William Ernest Smith, an electrical supplies salesman, and another man had leaped to their deaths from the top floor of the Texan Hotel after fire had engulfed the structure.<BR>At the beginning of World War II Lee Allan’s three older brothers, <BR>Carl, Donald and Dale joining the Army Air Corps and were overseas fighting in World War II. His brother Dale was six years older than Lee Allan.<BR>His mother, Florence Elizabeth (Phelps) Smith, believed she should be at home with her youngest son and built an apartment on to the garage of their home on NW 20th street to rent for extra income.<BR>Lee Allan worked jobs delivering newspapers, selling ice cream from a cart and doing odd jobs for Kerr-Linn, predecessor to Kerr-McGee and Ancel Earp insurance company. His good looks, optimistic sense of humor and strong moral and religious code, made him extremely popular with his classmates and their parents.<BR>Two passions dominated Lee Allan’s life, patriotism, probably due to his brothers fighting overseas, and a love of baseball. He attended Oklahoma City Indians (a farm club for the Cleveland Indians) games with his father and continued to ride his bike to the ballpark after his father’s death.<BR>Lee Allan formed strong friendships with his classmates, future OKC leaders like B.C. Clark Jr., Randy Everest, Bill Swisher, Richard Poole, Paul Hansen, Jack Catlett, Dick Ellis, G.W. James, Louie Trost, Stephen Chandler, Ed “Deedle De” Cordova, Coca Catlett Bell and Dee Saddler and he hung around the baseball park so much that he also came to know the radio voices of the Indians like Curt Gowdy. Lee Allan made the Classen High School baseball team his senior year as an outfielder.<BR>At OU he pledged Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) and developed a life-long friendship with football star Billy Vessels. Lee Allan also began to acquire a reputation for his ability to plan, organize and produce great parties and events and won the Intramural Manager of the Year for putting together sports teams and competitions. After graduating with a degree in business administration and completing four years of ROTC, Lee Allan was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the USAF Reserve and began active duty where he served in Vienna, Munich and finally in Tripoli, Libya. His job? Sports and entertainment activities to maintain high morale in the troops stationed in the remote North African desert.<BR>Shades of things to come, Lee Allan was meeting people in the entertainment industry, staging a July 4th show complete with fireworks he bought in Rome in the desert in 1954 and setting up Libya’s first zoo at the request of King Iris, ruler of Libya. He organized sports teams and competitions.<BR>Returning from his military service, Lee Allan tried several jobs, finally landing his dream job as a salesman for WKY radio in 1955. It was the beginning of a 22-year career with the Gaylord family’s broadcasting ventures including WKY-TV. In 1978, when WKY-TV became KTVY under new ownership, Lee Allan became President and General Manager of the station.<BR>Today, Lee Allan is Vice Chairman of Ackerman McQueen and serves as President of Oklahoma Events, Inc., a full service event production and marketing firm and also as President of Oklahoma Centennial Sports, Inc., which was the local organizing committee for the U.S. Olympic Festival ‘89 in Oklahoma.<BR>In 1960, Lee Allan married DeAnn Dudenhoeffer of Grandfield, OK. He had pursued her for years after first spotting the OU coed, seven years his junior, at an OU basketball game. They decided to build a new home on Riviera Drive, just off NW 63rd and Villa, and still live there today.<BR>Lee Allan’s ability to design and manage civic campaigns was already legendary when in 1969 a sermon at First Presbyterian Church on patriotism and love of country set Lee Allan’s mind spinning.<BR>In an era of flag burning and protesting over the Vietnam war, Lee Allan decided to organize a city-wide event to pay tribute to America. He believed his fellow citizens would support an Independence Day celebration. He formed the Oklahoma City Association of Broadcasters to throw its support behind the idea.<BR>Forming a non-profit to handle expenses and donations, he planned a special Fourth of July show, buying and distributing flags for auto antennas and creating a city park with a patriotic theme.<BR>He called the White House to book a military band, used his many friends and contacts to book personalities to appear in the show: former Miss Oklahoma Anita Bryant, song writer Jimmy Webb, Up With People, Oklahoma Astronaut Tom Stafford. All anyone had to do to attend the show free was wear red white and blue. The State Fair arena was packed to the rafters. The $35,000 profit was used to buy equipment and facilities for the Stars and Stripes Park on city-owned land on the shore of Lake Hefner.<BR>In 1970 Bill Thrash, program director at KOCO-TV became director of the Stars and Stripes show. The second show reached beyond Oklahoma and was televised on 110 stations from New York City to Los Angeles.<BR>In 1971, Lee Allen landed the legendary Bob Hope for the show and Oklahoma sports stars Mickey Mantle and Steve Owens. Every broadcaster and tv and radio personality in the city helped with the show. It was such a success Bob Hope wrote Lee Allan saying he wanted to be part of the show every year.<BR>In 1972, the entire country watched the Oklahoma City Stars and Stripes Show broadcast by NBC. This continued for five years, nationwide promotion of the two things nearest and dearest to Lee Allan’s heart, his country and his state.<BR>“After that, Lee Allan wanted to move on and nobody was willing to take over,” Ray Ackerman said. “You never see him sitting around. He is driven by his great love for Oklahoma.”<BR>“Lee Allan has done more than anyone to promote Oklahoma to a nationwide audience and put Oklahoma on the map in so many ways,” said Thrash this week. “His promotional efforts in the New York area brought a lot of attention to the 70’s revival of Oklahoma! It ended up coming here on its way to Broadway. He staged big events in New York drawing attention to Oklahoma, then did the same with the Will Rogers Follies.”<BR>Lee Allan was instrumental in planning the state 75th Diamond Jubilee celebration in 1982 featuring famous Oklahomans. He lead the drive for the Oklahoma Zoo’s Aquaticus and served as president of the Oklahoma Zoological Society and on the Zoo Trust.<BR>At one time this newspaper referred to him as “Mr. President of Everything” including the Boy Scouts, Chamber of Commerce, Allied Arts, Oklahoma Heritage Association and the State Fair board.<BR>If it made life better in Oklahoma or called national attention  to our many stars and our state, you can bet Lee Allan had something to do with it. He always give the credit to others, however no can even calculate the volunteer hours he as given to civic and charity work over the years.<BR>The Centennial Spectacular of Oklahoma stars was to be his grand finale, but this week he was on the phone urging companies to buy Oklahoma Centennial books for all the public schools and libraries in the state. And he is working with the publishers to create this coffee-table sized book featuring everything that was done to celebrate the Centennial.<BR>Last week at the Fortune Club, an organization of prominent civic leaders, Lee Allan spoke recapping the Centennial. One member leaned to the person next to him and whispered, “They’re going to pass out pledge cars as we leave.”<BR>Lee Allan, FRIDAY salutes you and can’t wait to see what visions you turn into reality next year.</div>
