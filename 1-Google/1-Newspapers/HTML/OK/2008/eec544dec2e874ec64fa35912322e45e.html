<div>Elizabeth “Kelly” Green sashayed along the fashion show ramp of OKC Golf and Country Club with her fiancé. You’re thinking, “So what?” The enormous Oklahoma Hospitality Club’s “Ladies in the News” crowd found it special. But then you perhaps didn’t know that bride-to-be Kelly is 81 and her boyfriend is 76!<BR>The Hospitality Club honorees are always exceptional women because of what they give [Continued from Page 1]<BR>to our community. They are also an adorable bunch. Though Kelly’s community activities are vast, you’d love knowing she’s well known in local “clown circles” as “Kelly Green the Clown.” Other honorees are:<BR>Julia Bays, who knows how to drive a wheat truck and tractor, a skill not common to most of us. But she has a Masters of Education, a Certified Counselor, AND has planted $179,000 worth of trees to improve our community. Her 90-year old mom was in attendance at the luncheon.<BR>Lauren Nelson, the 2007 Miss America. You can imagine how beautiful she looked on the runway. Lauren continues to champion the cause of Internet Safety - Protecting Kids Online, and intends to teach in our state.<BR>Amanda Taylor co-anchors 5 p.m. weekday newscasts, and heads up NEWS 9’s Consumer Watch Team. After that she doesn’t just put her feet up, she is a gourmet cook and plays classical piano.<BR>Cynde Collins-Clark was Oklahoma Mother of the Year for 2006. Her son served in Iraq in the first wave of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The effects of his year of service there became totally debilitating. Cynde developed “Veterans’ Families United,” a foundation whose goal it is to empower veterans and their families in the healing process.<BR>Joyce Hill is a real force in Daughters of the American Revolution. Joyce volunteers at the VA Hospital, provides musical therapy to Alzheimer residents, and through her DAR work speaks and interacts with hundreds of elementary school students.<BR>Kim Holland is the first woman elected Insurance Commissioner in Oklahoma state history. Under her leadership the Insurance Department has expanded responsiveness to Oklahoma citizens. Kim is a long-time advocate for affordable health insurance, and her experience in health care helps lead policy reforms.<BR>Margo Price learned about the Miracle League, a non-profit that was started in Atlanta. She obtained the franchise, and soon began raising money for a special field for her league. She raised $100,000 for the rubberized field surface. Margo, the mother of three sons, the youngest autistic, feels passionate about <BR>[Continued on Page 4]<BR>4activities for our special needs young people.<BR> Veronica Perry-Sharp, called “Ronnye,” is the author of Oklahoma’s Historical Centennial Cookbook. A vital volunteer in a myriad of civic activities, she is a past recipient of the Oklahoma Young Career Woman Award.<BR>Donna Lawrence’s career spans 25 years and includes entrepreneurship, marketing, public relations, fundraising and financial services. A breast cancer survivor, she changed the focus of her life to help women redesign their lives for more balance and inner peace.<BR>Daphne Tardibono was chosen because of her vision to train young people in the art of dance from a Christian perspective. As a former Mrs. Oklahoma International, Daphne continues to direct young people to develop their dreams.<BR> These were all special ladies. Chairman of the event Beth Cupp and her co-chairman Connie Weber had an active, hard-working committee, which included Lois Wade, Carolyn Bean, Marijane Newton, Jeanne Eckles, Toni Johnson, Shelly Fleet, Linda Carson, Cam Kirn, Kasey Billy, Joyce Baker, Anita Ashley, and Barbara Brown. <BR>Among the crowd were Sally Whitten, Sharlene Branham, Sara Treadway, Jean Burke, Carol Kaspereit, Gail Wernick, Ann McKenny, Kay Lynn Sturm, and Marjory Polk.<BR>As some gorgeous furs (fashions modeled were from Talbot’s and Geno’s Furs) were shown, our table got chatty. Ann McKenny was dressed in turquoise, and I coveted everything she wore as she has fabulous taste. She reduced us to giggles with her recital of her fur -- she reports that she has a “goat coat.” We tried, “Mongolian lamb?” But, no she insisted that the store told her it was goat. I have to see this! Sally Whitten has a friend who many many years ago, gave away her first fur coat, saying, “It was some low-life river animal.” We all pondered that a while, realizing we are less than familiar with “rare” fur. We daintily ate one of the foil-wrapped chocolate Easter eggs from the pretty yellow centerpiece. But when I tried to give some more to Carol Kaspereit, she looked mortified, but confessed, “I already ate three.” The bunnies nestled around the yellow centerpiece flowers were party favors for each of us -- but they were ceramic, so we didn’t eat them. Pretty luncheon -- a lot of fun. <BR>•A lively spring party given by Karen Luke and Annie Bohanon honored Cathy Stackpole. Red Lands Girl Scouts and Western District Scouts recently joined into one, and Cathy has the momentous job of being CEO of both.<BR>Karen Luke’s airy home accommodated a raft of women who support Girl Scouts; among them were Wanda Swisher, Rita Moore, Ann-Clore Duncan, Meg Salyer and Nancy Robertson. Lots of wonderful things to eat were offered, and I felt it my scouting duty to taste all of it. Joining me were Ione Brown, Pat Aaron, Jan Garrett, Nancy Leonard, Crystal Slater, and token guy, Jim Dawson.<BR>Karen, never one to talk about herself or boast of her family was coaxed to tell about daughter Julie Tubb’s experience as a scout leader. Julie bought inexpensive little mirrors for the girls who were considering joining, and asked, “Whom do you see?” Many girls were reticent to join because they had no family support, and poor self-esteem. Julie spent her year pouring values and leadership skills into the girls. Then, reintroducing the mirrors, the same question was posed. Those girls looked into the mirrors and answered, “Now I see something beautiful.” Scouting is making a difference in young girls’ lives.<BR>•ARTS! ARTS! ARTS! went crazy, crazy, crazy in the support for the University of Oklahoma’s Weitzenhoffer Family College of Fine Arts. The event’s patrons are passionate about the dinner/auction proceeds funding student and faculty grants for enrichment opportunities.<BR>Arts Arts Arts selected Sarah Hogan as honorary chairman. Precious, creative, energizer bunny Linda Garrett was event chairman – that little rabbit must never sleep or need new batteries! She was, with her amazing talent, creating luscious centerpieces, gathering auction items, planning publicity -- she probably even set the tables and swept the floor -- knowing her energy. <BR>Making their way around the silent auction items were Kathy and Don Cain, Jayme and Joe Howell, Sidney and Les Greathouse, Renate and Chuck Wiggin, Beverly and Mark Funke, Corey and Mike Blake, Laura Young, Seyan and John Hefner, Marcy and Gary Taber, Mary and Don Sherman, and Mary and Bob Allen.<BR>Attesting to Linda Garrett’s appealing personality in appealing to folks to donate auction items, there were wonderful things. Among them: a 19th century pastoral landscape oil painting, a topaz and diamond ring, party for 50 at the Swisher Farm, and a wine and cheese trip to Master sculptor Paul Moore’s studio. Winner of that can watch him create his masterpieces. He has sculpted the bronze Centennial Run statues along the Bricktown canal.<BR>During dessert, the musical theatre voices of OU students entertained, prodding us to ask, “Why are they not on American Idol?” To our amazement the OU School of Dance students flamenco-ed their way to the stage. That wealth of talent made it evident why OKC folks so support this cause.<BR>•Turning to page 15 of last week’s FRIDAY, I was totally puzzled as to why my photo and name were there – I knew nothing about it. My treasured friend, Gladys Tucker, had written as if she had interviewed ME! In the past, I’ve called Gladys several times, begging to write about her life, as she is one amazing woman. She always demurred. She did not interview me -- this was totally from her talented little head!<BR>Gladys wrote a flattering comparison regarding Erma Bombeck and me. Egad! Don’t I wish! Erma is floating about on a cloud in heaven saying, “Joy writes as I did? Oh, pull-eeeze!” <BR>This is the pinnacle of my writing when a woman as clever, fine, accomplished, and loving as Gladys would write a column about me. I’m humbled, grateful, and blessed to have a friend like Gladys.<BR>	<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>A black magic marker with a tight cap, and encased in a little Baggie, is a great packing tool. Obviously you can write on extra baggage tags, but can also “polish” your scuffed black shoes!<BR></div>
