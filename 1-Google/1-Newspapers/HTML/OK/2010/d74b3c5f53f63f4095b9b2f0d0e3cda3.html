<div>Having lunch at a local restaurant with handsome, gentle, and well-spoken Brooks Douglass, the terror in his life back at age 16 was not apparent. For many of us, much like President John Kennedy’s death, we remember where we were as the horrid news of the Oct. 15, 1979, slaughter in his Okarche home was aired. <BR>His minister father and mother were shot and killed, and his sister was raped and shot, and Brooks was shot. Two men, Glen Burton Ake, and Steven Keith Hatch did the killing, and justice has been meted out. But that’s not the Brooks that sat across the table from me. This man is purposeful and telling this story in the most honest manner.<BR>Now living outside Los Angeles, Brooks is a writer, producer, and an actor, and his film, Heaven’s Rain, which is the story of this unfathomable murder, is now a movie. Brooks plays the role of his father, and he coaxed his sister, Leslie, who has a heavenly voice, to be a lounge singer in the film. Leslie, the mother of two college students, lives in Edmond.<BR>Brooks was approached periodically about getting this story on film, but those visions weren’t how he saw this done, so he decided to make this independent film himself.<BR>Using the tool of a series of flash-backs, Brooks tells his story, and it builds to an ending that will amaze you and challenge your thinking forever.<BR>Though a segment was shot on location in Brazil where the Douglass family lived for four years, a good part of it uses Oklahoma City, 75 percent local talent -- both actors and film-making professionals. Through the eye of an experienced talent, Brooks was pleased by the amount of great skill in our state, the ease in getting things done, and the affordability of filming here. He’s other projects in mind to do in our area.<BR>Brooks’ life now includes beautiful wife, Julea, son Brody, four, and Cali, two. During our lunch the children,  blonde, blue-eyed and adorable, bounced in to hug daddy. Julea, with a PhD in Psychology, is a perfect life’s mate, as she has understanding and empathy for his earlier shattered life. She’s written curriculum used in about 500 school systems that focus on life skills and conflict resolution for high school kids. A wise and caring woman, she observed, “When his parents were killed, he had no control. This time, during the filming, he was surrounded by the loving crew who so respect him. And, they had a ‘double’ for Brooks in case the intensity was so great that he had to step out.” Julea’s connection with Brooks is that they both had lived in California, she’d also lived in Jenks, and they both were in Washington, DC, when she was in school, and Brooks was a state senator. Answering my question about what he saw in Julea, his answer was insightful and loving, “I’ve never before met a person with no guile and no deceit -- no agenda. She’s that person, and is always true to that.”<BR>Brooks’ blue eyes crinkle in happiness when he is surrounded by his family. He says he awakens so excited about each day because he loves all he is doing. He’s so real and honest with his feelings, and insists that Julea keeps him that way. He is also self-effacing and humble about where he is now. In speaking of his days as a state senator, he said, “If my dad hadn’t the reputation he did, there is no way a 26-year-old man could be a state senator. He ‘bought’ me a line of credibility. My awareness of that made me realize I can never tarnish that reputation. Hope I can pass that on to my children.”<BR>Though this is a main-stream movie, it will be universally appreciated by the Christian community. To tell the story with intense accuracy, he says the whole story must be told. The time-frame is just compacted for the story. But it is not a movie about crime, “but more of a love story -- a story of family and love of family, a brother and sister trying to find their way.” As if shaking it off, he said, “For some reason I was the only one who hadn’t figured out that in playing my father, I’d have to revisit the crime, and be the murdered victim. That was a shock to me, though it should have been obvious.”<BR>Brooks was in Lyric Theatre productions while growing up, and had a local acting coach. In Los Angeles, he continually takes classes and his acting coach is Larry Moss who coaches Leonardo DiCaprio and Hilary Swank, and you’ll see them thanking him at the Oscars. Larry Moss came to Oklahoma for two weeks and was present for the murder scene that went on until 4:30 a.m. in a Kingfisher farm house. Brooks explained, “The scene was just a necessary part of the movie, but actually only is about 60 seconds at the end, and comes in flashes.” <BR>He was philosophical about my question, “Would you be different had you not had this in your life?” He mused and said he’d probably have wound up in this place, but what happened to him and Leslie was just a HUGE curve getting here. Amazingly, he smiled, “I’m lucky. Those things shaped me into who I am.”<BR>This movie stars Mike Vogel whose previous credits are Cloverfield, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and Miami Medical. Lead actress is Erin Chambers whose resume includes Days of Our Lives, CSI:NY, and Medium. Actress Taryn Manning is also featured. The film was directed by Paul Brown, written by Brooks and Paul, and produced by Brooks.<BR>The premiere is at the Arclight Cinema in Los Angeles on Sept. 9, with the red carpet at 7:30 p.m., and the screening at 8 p.m. -- followed by a reception. Yes, you may touch me, as, yes, my husband and I were invited to the premiere. We’ve known this fine young man for many years and are warmed by his growth into such a sensitive and open-hearted husband and father. His talent, strength of spirit, and close relationship with God speak for themselves. <BR>Since Oklahoma City is becoming such a bastion of cinematic prominence, you’ll want to see the film as you’ll be delighted that your friends pop up in it! For a preview go to www.heavensrainmovie.com<BR>	<BR>TRAVEL TIP<BR>In the travel journal that you carry – you DO, don’t you? Jot down a log of all your purchases. Include what you paid in foreign currency and the equivalent in US dollars. Also, if you’re due back a VAT (Value Added Tax) keep the records on that also. It will make customs easier. I also tape an envelope on the inside cover of my travel book, and tuck the receipts in there. Then I don’t have to squat on the airport floor flinging worn unmentionables from the suitcase while I look for sales slips to support what I purchased.</div>
