<div>“How would you go about implanting a microchip in a tooth?” Mozelle Richardson asked her dentist. That slightly unusual conversation took place in the early 1980s as her fertile imagination took wing. Mozelle read a newspaper clipping about the theft of a skull from the WWII prisoner of war cemetery in El Reno, Oklahoma, and she thought that deserved looking into -- an intriguing story. A mental plot began. Her writer’s brain suggested a microchip would be the perfect spy-like method for transportation of information to give this mystery legs.<BR>In the 80s author James Michener spoke at a luncheon in the Sable room of the Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club. He and Mozelle were friends and joined by the fact that they both were writers. I remember sitting there after lunch and his interesting talk to the audience, and chatting with the others at my table. Looking around, I wondered where my mother-in-law, Mozelle had gone. For that matter, where was James Michener? <BR>The little scamps had escaped and gone to El Reno to do some fact-finding. She’d told him about the cemetery, and as I remember the adventure, the gates to the cemetery were locked, so it involved some climbing of fences. Mozelle soon penned off a story that started with our own Oklahoma, and takes the reader from here to Bavaria, and she weaves a tale involving the CIA, KGB, and the Israeli Mossad. Titled THE THYSSEN AFFAIR, the book is full of twists and turns, good guys and bad, love interest -- stuff which you don’t think your mother-in-law even knows. <BR>The cold war -- well, turned cold and interest declined -- so she went on to writing other books (she’s written nine). Just recently Mozelle revised this book as the world situation has returned us to a cold war situation and concern over that area of the world. In revising the book, her editor said, “Mozelle, revise it to be current with some spicy vernacular, add some profanity, passion and lust.”<BR>THAT, my friends, gives a 96-year old woman pause. Profanity wasn’t present in her home, and she hadn’t raised the four kids that way. What would they think? <BR>Heck, she’s a writer, so she decided how to proceed. “God,” she said she prayed, “You know I don’t use those words, but they are necessary to move this story along. What should I do?” I’ve long known that Mozelle and God have some meaningful conversations, so this doesn’t surprise me a bit. Laughingly, she reported that God gave her a special dispensation to use them in her book -- but nowhere else! You know what, God must have a sense of humor, after all, he created fungus, beer guts and Pee Wee Herman. So he probably did give Mozelle “a day pass” on this one. <BR>She wrote and edited her little heart out, and the dynamic result appeared at Full Circle Book Store when she was here for her book signing. Many, many friends came to see her and her book, but some were strangers who have just followed her career. The delightful message in this was that many “seniors” stopped by -- showing that being in your 90s is no excuse to stop being productive. <BR>Among the admirers there were Susan Robertson, and her mom Jerry Jennings, Carol Gwin, Mike Fauks and his mom, Janet, Beth and Jim Tolbert (who own Full Circle) Ellen Jane Wheeler, Jim Norick, Vickie Norick, Caroline Hendee and son Christopher, Janie and Bill Comstock. Janie bought several copies for friends, who, like she, remember slumber parties at the Richardsons’ in the 50s, when Mozelle was  making breakfast for the girls who had stayed up all night giggling.<BR>Others were Judy Richardson and Jerry Richardson, looking very proud of their mom, as were others in the family, Missy Garvin, Jamie Richardson, Lisa and Brad Richardson and their children, Jordan, Reid, and Riley, and Regan Markley. Getting books signed were Mary Frates, Gale and Lee Bollinger, Mary Nichols, Betsy Hyde and her dad Pierre Alaupovic, Shirley Blashke, Sally and Dick Burpee, Anita and Jack Dahlgren, Donna Vogel, Beth and Chuck Morrison, and Janie and Bill Dupree.<BR>•Full of holiday vigor were the guests dropping in and out of Pat and Jay Edwards’ home, just a few nights before Christmas. Tom McDaniel’s tie matched my lime green jacket, and we decided that color would best be named “Grinch”; Tom was there with the First Lady of OCU, Brenda. Others were Phyllis and Dan Stough, Ellen and Don Lisle, Sandy and Stewart Meyers, Deloris and Dennis Bradford, Janie and Bill Comstock, SoRelle and Don Fitzgerald.<BR>Circling the beautiful buffet were Teri and Tony Beals, Gene and Ed Barth, Barbara and Jackie Cooper, Sharon and John Bozalis, Governor George Nigh and his wife Donna, Mary and Mike Mahaffey, and Vicki and Leland Gourley. Dancing on the dessert table was a wacky flamingo/goose/ostrich -- well, bird-thing -- in holiday attire, and watching him/her were Jeaneen and Bob Naifeh, Kaye and Ed Cook, Lynn Trigg, Kay and Gates Oliver, Ruth and Dick Lampton, Gennie and Bob Johnson, and Margaret Short.<BR>I overheard one couple who were checking their watches, sigh, “We can’t go home yet, because our son and his girlfriend are making out in the living room.” Guests included Marlene and Herb Mee, Nina and Dick Gaugler, Donna and Pete Kiplinger, and DeAnn and Lee Allan Smith.<BR>Pat and Jay’s sweet smiles always have an implied giggle. They are such upbeat people that it’s just a pleasure to know them. Being invited to their home guarantees a good time, and everyone comes for fun. Not in the least image conscious, they tell stories of ridiculous things they accidentally do, endearing them to everyone.<BR>	Last year’s New Year’s resolutions are languishing in a drawer somewhere, waiting to be joined by some more unlikely plans. I can say that I wasn’t knowingly unkind or rude to anyone last year. I DID take off those extra six pounds last year. Those, being gracious, in turn, invited some friend pounds to visit, so the compounding of that is grim, and soon as I finish off the Christmas cookies, fudge and Aunt Bill’s – I’ll get a start on that… <BR>	But I have great faith in the ingenuity of you readers, the freshness of children, the enchantment of beautiful music and art, the charity and kindness of people. I can hardly wait to see how all that manifests itself in the new year and what exciting and currently unimaginable happenings we’ll be talking about in 2010. Happy New Year!</div>
