<div>Collapsed in laughter, we women were discussing “Man SPANX” – the Lycra undershirts that squish men’s bodies into love handle-less torsos. We figured that our husbands could all look like Greek gods, except the elastic would cause beer bellies to go somewhere – and they’d all have nineteen and a half inch necks. Besides, no man would put up with the discomfort that women do, just to look sleek.<BR>I was just “Julia Childs walking”, the night after the Oklahoma Hospitality Club’s Ladies in the News luncheon. Sitting next to Jean Burke, we started a discussion of vegetables. Why not? Jean cuts up any kind of vegetables; sprinkles olive oil and sea salt over, adds some rosemary twigs and bakes for about 50 minutes at 400-425 degrees. My husband was enthralled by this delicious and healthy new find, and said he’d love to have that for dinner three nights a week. So now I can sell him on the idea that my going to luncheons is a learning opportunity.<BR>Sharlene Branham, gracious hostess as she is, put together a delightful table of sassy women for the Hospitality Club’s luncheon. Just never knew what those women would be doing. At one time Linda Barnett, Sara Treadway, and Carol Kaspereit were sharing a shawl, and then Carol was insisting her raffle ticket was meant to be upside down in an effort to turn a six into a nine, to win a prize. Others at this table were Barbara Kerrick, Sally Whitten, Anne McKinney, and Marjory Polk.<BR>Talbot’s fashions, modeled by the ladies being honored, were wearable, in pretty spring colors, and not fussy. Your friends and neighbors who were honored for their many achievements and what they give to their state and communities, were, Karla Wallace, Isabel Chancellor, Pam Troup, Sharla Owens, Tsinena Bruno-Thompson, Debbie Senner, Jean Spitz, Shelly Soliz, Heather Sparks, and Lynn Soriano. <BR>My favorite new phrase by someone at the table about someone who’d done something ditzy and absent-minded, was, “God left a piece of software out of her.”<BR>Robin Marsh was the commentator, and welcoming remarks by Mary Fallin. Pat Grisham was Chairman of the event, Connie Weber was Co-Chairman, and Kay Culp is President of Oklahoma Hospitality Club. The honorees looked happy and lovely, and our state benefits from having these wonderful women. Some of those attending were Linda Haneborg, Annette Basey, Joan Maguire, Kay Lynn Sturm, Ann Johnstone, Rose Lane, Anne Gray, Anita Ashley, Marijane Newton, and Kay Lewis.<BR>It was a week of luncheons as the Pi Beta Phi Oklahoma City Alumnae Club held its “Gathering of Angels” at the Skirvin Hotel. Benefitting from the event were Celebrations Pre-School and City Care’s Whiz Kids. Those organizing the pretty afternoon were Chairman Cristi Bullard, and Co-Chair Leslie Lynn, and others Chris Verity, Susie Moock, Vikki Kembel, Joan Anderson, Rosemary Wilson, Erika Braver, Margo Ward, Mary Kay Bullard, and Britton Thomason. Others bringing the luncheon together were Britanny Byrd, Beth Hammack, Jamie Taylor, Betty Huckabay, Andrea Hampton, Katie Puckett, Raegan Rogers, and Mary Reneau.<BR>Attending were Susie Merritt, Dianne Meacham, Janie Axton, Carolyn Zachritz, Kay Wint, Gale Bollinger, Helen Sullivan, Sharon Wade, Carol Drake, Lil Ross, Katie Davis, Kelley Meacham, Heather Showalter, Kris Frankfurt, Karen Luke, Midge Lindsay, Hilary Blaney, Janie Comstock, Susan Sigmon, Betty Crow, and Linda Priest.<BR>So elegant, funny, and self-effacing was speaker Linda Faulkner, who was former Social Secretary to Nancy Reagan. Linda told the good, the bad, and the ugly – but about herself – how down-to-earth. Her learning curve was outlined from losing a whole bus full of birthday gifts which went on to Nova Scotia, instead of to the White House and Nancy Reagan – to Mrs. Reagan’s sitting in a chair (Linda had placed) too close to the edge of a platform and going upside down into a bed of flowers.<BR>But Linda must have gotten it right more than wrong as she had a lovely history with the First Family. She also orchestrated the evening when Princess Diana made her first visit to the White House and danced with John Travolta to a medley of “Saturday Night Fever”. Linda made her mark with a luncheon, hosted by President and Mrs. Reagan in a humble Coast Guard’s home on the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. Linda, using charming unpretentious flowers and china, created an atmosphere that was recalled as the “essence of America”. Linda was a delightful speaker.<BR>With parental pride, Jerry and Linda Barnett told me that their daughter, Mackenzie, was crowned “Valentine Queen”, as a freshman at Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, MO. Wentworth is a high school and college outside of Kansas City. But Mackenzie is not just another pretty face! Mackenzie is a starting point guard on the girls’ basketball team wears her cheerleading uniform to cheer the boys’ team, and she also sings the National Anthem before all that!<BR>To become “Queen”, Mackenzie had to collect a penny a vote, and as a soloist, she actually sang for some of her money. Her generous friends in OKC helped with that “penny thing”. As parents, Linda and Jerry offered to help with decorations. As Valentine’s Day was over, Linda enlisted the help of Tony Foss Florist, and borrowed his window décor – two huge Valentines and stands, to take to Missouri. The Barnetts pictured themselves dropping those off at the dance venue, but it’s never that easy. They spent some five hours tying bows on chairs, purchasing white linens, draping arches, etc. Linda had to laugh, “Jerry, my banker husband, who hires all our Christmas decorations hung, had crawled in all of these arched windows and hung small white lights. We really loved the opportunity – well, at least I did!”<BR>Of course the snow and sleet started on the evening of the dance, so the Barnetts found a Dollar General store off campus and bought every umbrella they could carry so that the girls’ long formals wouldn’t be ruined as they walked across campus to the dance. As Mother Nature is a frisky old girl, snow stopped after the dance, so they had to fill their arms with umbrellas as the kids sashayed off to do young adult stuff, and Linda, Jerry, and a small nation’s supply of umbrellas staggered off to their room. But then, their daughter was QUEEN – we’d all do the same. <BR>Mackenzie was a student at Casady, so many of you know her. Showing her loyalty to OKC, see the photo of Mackenzie, FRIDAY newspaper, and escort, Miller Yost, a senior from Florida. <BR>                    ***TRAVEL TIP*** <BR>If you’re looking for a gutsy travel adventure, book a trip on a freighter! The itinerary can be quite tentative, and you could be gone two weeks longer than you intended, but you’ll probably know for sure the port you’re departing from – and where you hope to end up! Contract the shipping line directly and see what is available! Probably going to lose a reader or two this way!</div>
