<div>In rankings based on a survey of Oklahoma workers, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation has once again been named the state’s top workplace.<br> In ratings based on surveys compiled by Energage, an independent polling firm, OMRF took the top spot in the firm’s annual Best Places to Work competition in the large organization category (350-plus employees).<br> OMRF conducts research on diseases such as cancer, lupus, heart disease and Alzheimer’s. The Oklahoma City-based nonprofit has now won the competition’s top prize two of the past three years, and ranked in the top 10 every year since the Best Places to Work contest began in 2013.<br> “Our aim is to create a work environment in which our employees feel like they are stimulated intellectually, growing professionally, and recognized for their efforts,” said OMRF Vice President of Human Resources Courtney Stevens Greenwood. “While we constantly examine our practices to find ways to do better, these results tell us we’re on the right track.”<br> One of the factors that makes OMRF special, said Greenwood, is the diversity of the foundation’s workforce. <br>“We have employees here from almost 30 different countries,” she said. “They bring fresh ideas and different approaches, and that really supercharges our organization.”<br> For the rankings, Energage, which specializes in assessing workplace dynamics, conducts confidential online surveys of staff members at as many as 800 Oklahoma employers each year. Workers rate their employers on a variety of factors that include job satisfaction, management quality, pay and benefits, and opportunities for growth.<br> This year, OMRF also received a special award for receiving the highest marks among all organizations in all categories for the quality of its managers.<br> “It’s quite an honor to be named number one by your own employees,” said OMRF President Stephen Prescott, M.D. “We strive to give every person at OMRF not only the resources and support to succeed, but also the freedom to achieve the work-life balance that is essential to long-term job satisfaction.”<br> The end goal, Prescott said, is simple. <br>“We want to make OMRF a place that talented people choose to call home for their entire careers.”<br><br><table align=center cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=1><tr><td><img class=pagephoto src=https://okcfriday.com/business-red-earth-board-members.jpg></td></tr><tr><td align=center><font class=pagephotocaption>Fridaylanders named to the Red Earth board.</font></td></tr></table><br>Our leaders named to Red Earth board<br><br>Five Fridayland residents have been elected to serve on the board of Red Earth, Inc, the non-profit 501 c (3) organization recognized as the region’s premier organization for advancing the understanding and continuation of Native American traditional and contemporary culture and arts.
