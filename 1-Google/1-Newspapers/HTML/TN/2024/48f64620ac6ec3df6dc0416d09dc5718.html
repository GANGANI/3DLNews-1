Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires that an applicant obtain a water quality certification from the state when a federal permit is required. This notice is intended to inform interested parties of this permit application and draft permit and rationale, and to ask for comments and information necessary to determine possible impacts to water quality. At the conclusion of the public notice period a final determination will be made whether to issue or deny the permit. </p><p>PERMIT COORDINATOR Claire Wainwright</p><p>Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation</p><p>Division of Water Resources, Natural Resources Unit</p><p>William R. Snodgrass Tennessee Tower</p><p>312 Rosa L. Parks Avenue</p><p>Nashville, Tennessee 37243</p><p>615-476-3450</p><p>claire.wainwright@tn.gov</p><p>APPLICANT Southeastern Freight Lines, Inc.</p><p>Attn: Ryan Smigiel</p><p>420 Davega Rd.</p><p>Lexington, NC 29073</p><p>e-copy: Ryan.Smigiel@SEFL.com</p><p>LOCATION South of E Holmes Rd between Tchulahoma Rd and Getwell Rd</p><p>Memphis, Shelby County</p><p>Unnamed wetlands, unnamed ponds, unnamed tributaries to Tenmile Creek</p><p>Latitude: 35.0004, Longitude : -89.9452</p><p>To view the proposed location of these impacts and the watershed condition, visit the Division’s map viewer at http://tdeconline.tn.gov/dwr/ and search on the permit number or coordinates listed in this Public Notice. </p><p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION / PURPOSE</p><p>Southeastern Freight Lines, Inc. proposes unavoidable permanent impacts to 2.13 acres of wetland, 5.73 acres of jurisdictional pond, and 1,181 feet of unnamed tributaries to Tenmile Creek associated with the construction of a new facility in Memphis. Mitigation for permanent impacts will be provided through wetland and stream credit purchases from the Rossville Farm Mitigation Bank. </p><p>ANTIDEGRADATION </p><p>In accordance with the Tennessee Antidegradation Statement (Rule 0400-40-03-.06): For impacts to streams, the Division has made a preliminary determination that the proposed activities will result in no significant degradation in a waterbody with unavailable parameters for habitat because the applicant proposes mitigation to offset any appreciable permanent loss of resource values. For impacts to wetlands and ponds, the Division has made a preliminary determination that the proposed activities will result in greater than de minimis degradation of waters with available parameters. Any appreciable permanent loss of resource value associated with the proposed impact is proposed to be offset by sufficient mitigation to result in no overall net loss of resource value. Pursuant to Antidegradation Statement, in waters with available parameters for habitat, an activity that would cause degradation of habitat above the level of de minimis will only be authorized if applicant has demonstrated to the Department that there are no practicable alternatives to prevent or lessen degradation associated with the proposed activity and the degradation is necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the area and will not violate the water quality criteria for uses existing in the receiving waters. </p><p>FACTORS CONSIDERED</p><p>In deciding whether to issue or deny this permit, the Division will consider all comments of record and the requirements of applicable federal and state laws. The Division will consider the nature, scale and effects of proposed impacts. The Division will consider practicable alternatives to the alteration, loss of waters or habitat, diminishment in biological diversity, cumulative or secondary impacts to the water resource, and adverse impacts to unique, high quality, or impaired waters. In making this decision, a final determination will be made evaluating appreciable permanent loss of resource values and proposed compensatory mitigation to ensure the project will result in no overall net loss of state water resources values. </p><p>HOW TO COMMENT</p><p>TDEC is requesting public comment on this proposed permit action. Obtaining a broad range of facts and opinions on Agency actions is one of the best ways to ensure appropriate decisions. Persons wishing to comment on the proposal are invited to submit written comments to the Division. Written comments must be received within thirty days following distribution of the approved public notice materials (including signage and newspaper ad). Comments will become part of the record and will be considered in the final decision. The applicant’s name and permit number should be referenced. Send all written comments to the Division’s address listed below to the attention of the permit coordinator. You may also comment via email to water.permits@tn.gov. </p><p>After the Division makes a final permit determination, a permit appeal may be filed by the applicant or by any person who participated in the public comment period whose appeal is based on comments given to the Division in writing during the public comment period or in testimony at a formal public hearing. If it is hard for you to read, speak, or understand English, TDEC may be able to provide translation or interpretation services free of charge.

The request must be received by the Division within the comment period, indicate the interest of the party requesting it, the reason(s) a hearing is warranted, and the water quality issues being raised. When there is sufficient public interest in water quality issues, the Division will hold a public hearing in accordance with 0400-40-07-.04(4) (f). Send all public hearing requests to the attention of the permit coordinator at the address listed below or via email to water.permits@tn.gov. Any scheduled public hearings will be advertised through a similar public notice process. </p><p>FILE REVIEW</p><p>The permit application, supporting documentation, including detailed plans and maps, draft permit and rationale, and related comments are available for review on the internet at the Division’s data viewer at Report on Permits (tn.gov)::::: by entering the permit file number listed in the title of this Public Notice.
