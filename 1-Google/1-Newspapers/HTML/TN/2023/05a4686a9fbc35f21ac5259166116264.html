âOur friends at Dominoâs have provided the most wonderful gift â a home away from home for the children and families at St. Jude Childrenâs Research Hospital,â said Thomas. âThe Dominoâs Village represents one of the many things my father, Danny Thomas, envisioned when he founded St. Jude: a place of comfort and respite for families who come to St. Jude from across the country and around the world. This safe haven not only provides a loving home environment but also a sense of community for families as their children go through the difficult process of being treated for cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Together, we can continue to make a difference in the lives of children.â
<br><br>
Dominoâs continues to have a prominent presence on the St. Jude campus, with the Assessment and Triage Clinic Delivered by Dominoâs and the Dominoâs Event Center. Due to the generosity of donors and partners like Dominoâs, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food so they can focus on helping their child live.
<br><br>
âWe are incredibly grateful to Dominoâs and its customers, employees, franchisees and customers, whose generosity has changed so many lives and been an integral part of our St. Jude history for almost two decades,â said <a href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/s/richard-c-shadyac.html" target="new">Richard C.
