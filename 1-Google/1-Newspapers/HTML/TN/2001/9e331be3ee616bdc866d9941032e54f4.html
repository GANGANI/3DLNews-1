like it's time to &lt;File+Exit> the Microsoft Paintbrush and double-click

on the word processor. District Attorney Bill Gibson has done something

too pathetic to be captured in mere a .BMP file.

<BR>Gibson, (whose 13th Judicial District leads the state in the production

of methamphetamine], has been taking out 6.5" by 13" ads in the <I>Herald-Citizen</I>

to announce that he won't be putting up signs during his re-election campaign.



<P>"Instead of putting up political road signs and yard signs," Gibson

explains in the ads, "I am donating that money toward the purchase of the

Child Lures School Safety Program, to protect our children from abduction

and sexual abuse. This will be accomplished through an organization called

'Candidates Who Care.'"



<P>Now if you ask me, anyone who would try to use the specter of child

molestation for political gain has a few screws loose. And anyone who would

spend campaign money to tell people that he won't be spending campaign

money is about three beers short of a six-pack.



<P>Bill probably thought his anti-abuse campaign was beyond reproach, since

protecting our children ranks right up there with motherhood and apple

pie. But Ma Gibson's pie left a bad taste in my mouth.



<P>Child Lures is not a charity. It is a for-profit business. You do not

"donate" to a business; you buy a product. The product Gibson wants to

buy is the School Safety Program, which costs about $400 per school. Child

Lures urges schools to supplement the School Safety Program by providing

each student with its Family Guide at about a dollar a pop. "For orders

of 10,000 or more copies," trumpets the <A HREF="http://www.childlures.com">Child

Lures web site</A>, "Child Lures, Ltd. will customize the publication (with

logos, advertisements, letters, and/or photographs) for organizations.

This is particularly popular with corporate sponsors who recognize the

public relations power of so valuable a gift."



<P>Children in the 13th Judicial District will no doubt be lugging home

copies of the Family Guide emblazoned with the smirking face of Bill Gibson

and the other "Candidates Who Care." I've never heard of "Candidates Who

Care" but I can tell you this much: The only thing any candidate cares

about is getting elected. And if Bill Gibson is using his campaign money

to buy the Child Lures School Safety Program instead of yard signs, its

only because Child Lures may be a more efficient means of bringing his

name to the attention of voters.



<P>If Bill really cared about the children, he would just buy the Child

Lures materials and shut up about it. And he would use his own money, not

campaign money donated to "Citizens to Re-elect Bill Gibson, [former Chief

of Police] Bill Bilyeu, Treasurer." And if he really cared about the children,

he wouldn't spend money on newspaper ads to tell people that he won't be

spending money on signs. I don't know what 84.5 square inches of space

in the Herald-Citizen costs, but I imagine the money for those ads could

have gone a long way towards the purchase of one or two School Safety Programs.



<P>Now what I'd like to know is this: How much campaign money has Gibson

used to buy the School Safety Programs? Bill's ads lead us to believe that

he is donating the money that would otherwise have been used to buy signs.

How many signs was he planning to buy? For all we know, he wasn't planning

to buy any. That would translate to a pretty small donation. Like $0.



<P><IMG SRC="http://www.putnampit.com/gengib.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=195 WIDTH=304 ALIGN=RIGHT>In

his newspaper ad, Gibson says, "I do have a sign. When you see it beside

the road, you'll see me with it . . . " I assume he isn't talking about

the sign on his office building. The money spent on that thing would have

bought LOTS of School Safety Programs and Family Guides. Maybe Gibson is

talking about the sign that he'll be holding AFTER the election. The one

that says, "Will Work For Food."<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
