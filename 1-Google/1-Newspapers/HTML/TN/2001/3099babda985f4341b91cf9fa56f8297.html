<UL>The Cookeville <I>Herald-Citizen</I> is up to its old tricks -- only

telling half the story. The following question appeared in the H-C's "I'd

Like To Know" column on February 23.

<BR>&nbsp;

<UL><I>I saw a news clip on a Nashville TV station which said that attorneys

graduating from the Nashville School of Law can not practice law outside

of the State of Tennessee. Is this true? I have heard that several Cookeville

attorneys, including attorneys in the DA's office, have their degrees from

that school. Does this mean we are in the hands of unqualified attorneys?</I></UL>

To answer the question, columninst Ann Johnson turned to that paragon of

legal virtue, District Attorney Bill Gibson. Gibson insisted that Nashville

School of Law graduates are well qualified, and listed several present

or former judges and politicians as examples of the school's fine product.



<P>What Johnson's column did not tell you is that Bill Gibson, who barely

got through high school, is a graduate of the Nashville School of Law.

So what do you think he's going to say when asked if Nashville School of

Law graduates are qualified? "Uh, gee, Ann....No, we're NOT qualified....In

fact, I oughta be kicked out of here and sent back to the Holiday Inn to

wash dishes. Except they wouldn't have me because I couldn't tell the hot

water faucet from the cold water faucet."



<P>And neither Johnson nor Gibson ever answered the reader's first question

regarding the abililty of Nashville School of Law graduates to practice

outside Tennessee.



<P>The answer: No, they can't. They can't practice outside the state because

the Nashville School of Law is not approved by the American Bar Association.



<P>I'm sure that the Nashville School of Law has turned out many fine lawyers.

But if you assume that the ABA's approval is a valid benchmark of the school's

quality, then you must also assume that, on average, the school's graduates

are less qualified than those who graduate from approved programs.



<P>Because they cannot practice outside Tennessee, and because private

law firms have no desire to take on under-qualified attorneys, the Nashville

School of Law's graduates invariably enter public service. Billy Boy (or

Billy Girl) hires on as an assistant DA, gets his name in the local paper

a few times, then runs for district attorney or (even worse) a judge's

office.



<P>If Billy Boy plays the game and kisses up to the local bosses (like

former chief of police Bill Bilyeu), his election will be assured. As a

DA, Billy Boy hires other Nashville School of Law graduates to work as

his assistant DAs (you don't think he'd hire someone smarter than himself,

do you?). In time, his assistants go out into the world, as DAs and judges,

where their legal bumblings affect the lives of ordinary people like you

and me.



<P>Thus, the Nashville School of Law's hideous progeny breed within the

Tennessee justice system, and promulgate its sucking evil into the very

heart and soul of every citizen in the state.



<P>And you won't read THAT in the <I>Herald-Citizen.</I><I></I>
