<B>COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (May 18, 1997) Â— </B>When the Tennessee Court of Criminal


Appeals reversed the attempted murder conviction of car dealer Fabien Eldridge


May 7, the case and all its warts were also remanded to the original trial


court and Judge Leon Burns in Putnam County. But <I>The Pit</I> has learned


that Burns may have already decided to recuse himself.





<P><IMG SRC="fabien.gif" HEIGHT=183 WIDTH=169 ALIGN=RIGHT>The appellate


court found Gibson's office had relinquished control of the case to private


prosecutors hired by the victim, Robert Fahey. The opinion noted that the


private prosecutors tried to get $300,000 for their client in return for


reducing the criminal charges against Eldridge. <I>The Pit</I> has verified


this independently with two witnesses to the offer, Michael Chambers, Eldridge's


co-defendant in the case, and Chambers' lawyer, Marshall Judd of the state


public defender's office,&nbsp; who got Chambers acquitted.





<P>The appellate opinion written by Judge Joe Riley outlines so many abuses


in the prosecution that if the state intended to make Eldridge stand trial


a second time "I'd hope the district attorney general will also recuse


himself," said Frank Buck, one of Eldridge's appellate lawyers.





<P>On May 16, Buck told<I> The Pit,</I> Burns called him to say he was


recusing himself. That means if the state wants to try Eldridge again it


will have to go to a different judge. Contacted at home that evening, Burns


refused to answer questions about whether or why he had recused himself.





<P><I>Recusal</I> means disqualification "because of self interest, bias


or prejudice," according to <I>Black's Law Dictionary.</I>





<P>"I told Mr. Buck what I had to tell him, and do not feel it necessary


to comment further," Burns said.





<P>Gibson said he appointed Cookeville lawyers David Day and Michael Knowlton


private prosecutors because his office was "too busy" to prosecute the


case. However, Knowlton and Day also represented victim Fahey in a civil


suit against Eldridge for the injuries he received in a November 1992 fight


in Fahey's residence. That is the fight for which Eldridge's attempted


murder charge arises. The prosecutors therefore had a monetary interest


in the outcome of the criminal trial and lacked impartiality, the opinion


said. Knowlton and Day stood to make as much as $1 million in contingency


fees in the civil case.





<P>Gibson acknowledged that he knew Knowlton and Day had the civil case,


but said he thought that would make them up to speed on the facts and therefore


good prosecutors.





<P>In the appeal, the state argued that Gibson's office contacted the Board


of Professional Responsibility, the ethics watchdog of the legal profession


in Tennessee, to ask for its blessings on the appointment. However, the


board has to date found no record of such a contact. Charles High, a prosecutor


with the board, said there was no written opinion, and only written opinions


carry weight.





<P>Alan Dershowitz, another of Eldridge's lawyers, has written the board


to see if the contact took place. The defense lawyers find it unbelievable


that the board would approve of the appointment of private prosecutors


who also had a stake in a parallel case.





<P>Judge Burns signed the appointment order but Eldridge's lawyers were


not informed until days before the trial, according to Eldridge's appeal,


implying there was improper <I>ex parte</I> contact between the prosecution


and the judge.





<P>"We thought the court [of criminal appeals in Nashville] would have


no trouble seeing what happened here," Buck told <I>The Pit.</I>





<P>Buck said the state denied there was <I>ex parte</I> communication between


the judge and prosecutors.





<P>Asked if he believed Judge Burns' denial of a one-sided meeting, Buck


said: "Judges don't go around signing court orders without talking to someone."





<P>"I think that any fair reading of the federal cases that were cited


would lead someone to a different conclusion."





<P>Now, the state must decide whether to appeal the appellate court's unanimous


opinion, which it can do within 60 days of the opinion. The state also


must decide whether the facts of a case that Gibson's office was too busy


to prosecute the first time around now warrant his resources and a retrial.


That will be a tough decision for Gibson, whose term expires next year.





<P>But the facts are not the only thing on Gibson's mind. Eldridge is suing


Gibson and the others for alleged civil rights violations in the prosecution.


Because the appellate court found the prosecution violated Eldridge's due


process rights, the state may retry Eldridge in hopes of getting another


conviction or bargaining in an offer to drop a second prosecution in exchange


for dropping the civil rights case.





<P>"That's extortion again," Eldridge said. "I'm taking this to the end.


I ain't dropping nothing. If they're going to try me again, then come on."





<P>Buck, who is chairman of the state legislature's Judicial Committee,


said "The quality of the court system is always governed by the quality


of lawyers."





<P>"Obviously, this was not a close case. This was not a case the court


should have trouble with. If we old timers in the bar don't stand up and


raise the roof, then who's going to?"





<P>This case and the behavior of Gibson, Burns, Knowlton and Day has shined


such a disgraceful light on Putnam County justice that when Eldridge's


mother went to Harvard and knocked on Professor Dershowitz's door, he signed


on.





<P>"Mrs. Eldridge is very persuasive," Dershowitz told<I> The Pit</I>,


and although he only takes four or five appeals of the thousand or more


he is asked to look at each year, the case of the Cookeville used car dealer


made the cut.





<P>Now, some are wondering whether recusal of Burns and Gibson is enough?


Should prosecutors and judges resign when appellate courts find they have


abused their authority and the law?
