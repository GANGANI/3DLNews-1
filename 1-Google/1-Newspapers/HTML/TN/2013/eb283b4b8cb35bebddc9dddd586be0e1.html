<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">NASHVILLE, TN -- In just one 24-hour period, 768 victims of domestic violence and their children across Tennessee received life-saving services from local domestic violence organizations. Survivors were given a safe place to stay and resources to escape violence and abuse. Over 100 requests went unmet in that same day due to lack of funds.  In addition, domestic violence victim advocates in Tennessee answered 295 emergency hotline calls. 
<BR><BR>
According to a report released on September 12, 2012 by The National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) reduced funding for domestic violence services means that programs are unable to help survivors with shelter, attain legal help, or leave abusive partners.
<BR><BR>
âAcross the country, domestic violence programs are working harder than ever to help victims of abuse,â said Kim Gandy, President and CEO of NNEDV. âBut we also know that, across the board, funding for victim services is dwindling while the demand is climbing.â Unfortunately, 101 times on that same day, requests for services went unmet in Tennessee, largely due to lack of funding.
<BR><BR>
"Clearly, there aren't enough resources for domestic violence victims in Tennessee," said Kathy Walsh, Executive Director of the Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence. "As federal resources are cut and demand for services increases, the state is going to have to fill the gap to make sure more victims don't go without the help they need."
<BR><BR>
â¢ Tennessee ranks 3rd in the nation for the rate of women murdered by men. In 2011, there were 96 domestic homicides in Tennessee; police responded to more than 84,500 domestic violence offenses; and domestic violence made up more than 52% of all crimes against persons.
<BR><BR>
â¢ While Tennessee has 95 counties, we only have 30 state-funded family violence shelters. Many of these shelters serve multiple counties and large rural populations.
<BR><BR>
â¢ State funding for family violence shelters is generated from marriage license fees and offender fines and totals less than a million dollars a year. There has been no increase in state funding in more than 10 years.  
<BR><BR>
â¢ Federal funds for shelters were reduced by 8.7% in 2012 and even greater cuts are expected in 2013 as a result of sequestration.
<BR><BR>
â¢ Family violence shelters have reported an increase in the demand for services while at the same time experiencing significant cuts in funding.  
<BR><BR>
The economic conditions of the past few years have had a significant impact on domestic violence programs. âCutting funds to domestic violence programs means that victims have fewer places to turn,â added Gandy. âIt is impossible to hold offenders accountable and provide safe havens for victims with reduced funding for services and shelters. Budget cuts at the local, state, and federal level are creating increased danger to victims and their children.â 
<BR><BR>
Additionally, funding cuts resulting from the sequester also worry victim advocates. According to recent analysis, sequestration will result in approximately 70,000 fewer victims getting help from domestic violence programs and approximately 36,000 fewer victims having access to protection orders, crisis intervention and counseling, sexual assault services, hospital-based advocacy, transitional housing services, and help with civil legal matters. 
<BR><BR>
On the census day, local domestic violence programs across the country provided help and safety to 64,324 adults and children who were victims of domestic violence. Sadly, 10,471 times on that same day, requests for services went unmet, largely due to lack of funding.
<BR><BR>
Funding to underwrite some of the costs of administering the survey was generously provided by the Avon Foundation for Women and printing was provided by the Allstate Foundation. âThis highly regarded report provides a snapshot of the life-saving services being provided to victims of domestic violence every day,â said Carol Kurzig, President of the Avon Foundation for Women. âWe are honored to partner with NNEDV to help them shine a light on the great work happening, as well the many unmet needs in every community across the nation.â
<BR><BR>
On September 12, 2012, 32 out of 32, or 100% of identified local domestic violence programs in Tennessee participated in the survey. The figures represent the information reported by the 32 participating programs about services provided during the 24-hour survey period. In addition to the number of victims served, these programs answered more than 295 hotline calls and educated more than 731 individuals on domestic violence in Tennessee on the survey day.
