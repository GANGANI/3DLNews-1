<p><font face="Bookman" size="3">Sevier Countyâs own Donny Richmond is once again making headlines around the world. The recording artist, TV host, and movie actor is scoring big with his new album, "Uncle Donny Is Back!â The album, according to audience response, may soon need to be re-named "Uncle Donnyâs Greatest Hits!â as it is swiftly becoming an iTunes favorite.

<font face="Arial" size="2" font="font" color="gray">Donny Richmond</font>
</center></p>
<p><font face="Bookman" size="3">Released June 16, several singles from the project are already in the international charts. "The Dream Themeâ has now reached #1, "A Satisfied Mindâ reached #1 just weeks ago, and "The Happiest Guy In The Whole U.S.A.â has been hovering around the Top 20, on the international Airplay Express Countdown. These charts incorporate reports from Australia, the U.K., Holland, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, and many more.
<br><br>
In addition, "Ridinâ Out The Stormâ and "The Smaller The Townâ from the CD, are featured in the new movie, "Saving Faith,â for which Donny was recently nominated Best Lead Actor in a Feature Film. Both of these songs are also former #1s on national U.S. country/gospel charts, now digitally re-mastered. The "Saving Faithâ movie has now been picked up for distribution in the U.S. and Canada by Lionsgate Entertainment, a media giant, known for its association with Academy Award winning motion pictures. Additional movie distribution is reaching diverse areas of the world including Africa, South Africa, and the Ukraine.
<br><br>
Donnyâs self-penned "Squeegee,â currently climbing the international charts, was also a chart hit for him in 2015. It now features an internationally popular, accompanying line dance arranged by renowned U.K. choreographer, Gaye Teather. All of the songs on "Uncle Donny Is Back!â are quite radio friendly.
<br><br>
Donny Richmond is a multi-award winning entertainer, accomplished in many phases of the entertainment industry. With such accolades as Artist of the Decade and The Living Legend Award, this International Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame member always seems to uncover some new area of creativity to explore. For his fans, the simple explanation is this â Donny Richmond is a genius. In recent years, Donny has remained very well represented in various international radio charts, with country, gospel, easy listening, and pop, and more than 25 chart hits since 2006, including #1s in more than a dozen countries. His TV Specials have aired nationally in European countries, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Caribbean countries, South Pacific countries, and others. Richmond is proud to be a Sevier County citizen, and in 2010 was the one selected to induct Sevier Countyâs own Dolly Parton into the Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame.
<br><br>
Standouts on "Uncle Donny Is Back!â include Donnyâs cover version of the late Roy Orbisonâs smash hit of yesteryear, "Cryingâ. As reviewed in the U.K.âs Jamsphere Magazine, by music journalist Rick Jamm, "this beautiful ballad, with its big finish, has not seen a rendition this true to the caliber of Roy Orbisonâs since Roy, himself.â
<br><br>
Regarding Donnyâs cover of "Puppet on a String,â once recorded as a movie song by Elvis Presley, Jamm states on behalf of himself and staff, âWeâre betting Elvis would be proud of Donnyâs versionâ. An interesting footnote here is that Elvis Presleyâs step brother, Rick Stanley, was heard proclaiming to a crowd of people where he and Donny were appearing on the same program, "If Elvis was alive today, he would be a Donny fan!â
<br><br>
"If I Only Had Time,â originally a #1 song for New Zealand star, John Rowles, is put across with sensitivity by Donny, in a style reminiscent of Tom Jones, brought forward to 2017. Donnyâs mother loved this song, and Donny recorded it for this project to honor her memory. "Squeegee,â written by Donny, takes us back to the good-time feel of 1950âs style rock ân roll, with its upbeat, fun style, and is delivered in classic fashion by the "rockabillyâ side of Donny Richmond. "A Satisfied Mind,â a favorite of Donnyâs dad back when Porter Wagoner took it to #1, has a great moral and is another vehicle for Donnyâs honest and compelling vocals. It is included here to honor the memory of his dad. Five of the 12 songs of "Uncle Donny Is Back!â utilize Donnyâs outstanding songwriting flair. Mixed throughout the album are touches of country music, inspirational thoughts, soulful singing, good-time music, rock ân roll, and even a sweet taste of the "big bandâ era.
