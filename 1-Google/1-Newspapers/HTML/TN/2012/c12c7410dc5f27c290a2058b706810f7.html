<img src="hazel-hall.jpg" alt="hazel hall" width="253" height="324" border="0" align="right" />A special member of our community passed away Saturday morning after jumping from her 11th floor apartment window at Northgate Terrace, 4301 Whittle Springs Road in Knoxville.  Hazel Hall, who would have turned 64 on December 18, was an active Knoxvillian. <BR><BR>
Hazel had a difficult life with many downs and few ups.  She struggled with mental illness her entire life yet she stayed in tune with what was going on in our world.  Her faith, college education, and interest in the world around her enabled her to survive as long as she did.
<BR><BR>
Being quick witted, Hazel kept everyone around her alert to her opinions.
<BR><BR>
As an active member of her church, she attended nearly every service.  Already having experienced a difficult life, her home was burned down and she became homeless for a period of time.  Hazel was living in the streets of Knoxville, sometimes sleeping at KARM or wherever she could find a place to rest her head.
<BR><BR>
A former homeless person invited her to a Christmas Brunch at First Baptist Church in 2006.  The church serves a large buffet breakfast to area homeless individuals annually.  Hazel attended the brunch and soon became involved in the church which assisted her in gaining adequate housing at Isabella Towers and meeting other needs she had.  Each year since 2006, Hazel helped with the Christmas Brunch by serving other homeless people of which 947 were served in 2011.
<BR><BR>
Her life began to turn around.  She was an avid reader and made a trip to the public library weekly to turn in books she had read the previous week and to check out new books that would occupy a lot of her time.
<BR><BR>
Hazel was a member of the Golden Notes senior choir at First Baptist Church and a member of the Mercy Sunday School class.  She developed and maintained many friendships in the church and was a good friend and an excellent listener.  Being a former homeless person and having had a difficult childhood and adulthood, Hazel had many needs.  A large number of people in her church surrounded her with love and care, meeting as many of her needs as they could throughout the years.  She loved her pastor, her Sunday School teacher Mercy Jeyaraja Rao, and her dear friends Steve and Terri King.  
<BR><BR>
The Kings made a trip every Sunday morning to Hazel's apartment to pick her up for church.  On Sunday morning, November 11, 2012, they arrived at Northgate Terrace, but Hazel wasn't standing in her usual place.  They soon learned the devastating news of her death.  The Kings had attended to many of Hazel's needs throughout the years and were faithful to make certain she had what she needed at all times.
<BR><BR>
Always attuned to world news, she could talk intelligently about most any newsworthy topic.  She stayed on top of politics, the war, and national crises.
<BR><BR>
In December 2010 Hazel wrote a brief article for the Knoxville Daily Sun entitled <a href="http://www.knoxvilledailysun.com/religion/glory-of-christmas.html" target="_blank">"The Glory of Christmas"</a>.  On December 22, 2010 the Daily Sun published another one of her articles, "<a href="http://www.knoxvilledailysun.com/homelessness/inside-the-ranks.html" target="_blank">Homelessness from Inside the Ranks</a>".  She also wrote poems, plays, and stories for her Sunday School class.
<BR>
<BR>
Even through her struggles, Hazel continued to give back to those who had helped her move forward in her life.  Many people are hurting because of the final choice she made because of her own hurts.  She carried on as long as she could, giving back to the community who had helped her and cared for her.</font></p>
