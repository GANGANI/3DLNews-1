Take a moment if you can to like, rate, and subscribe to us wherever you get your podcasts. We value that a lot. So we have the college football survivor show.

He has won more than 70 awards for writing/editing during his career, covering everything from sports to breaking news to features to column writing and photography. In 2015, he was honored with the Warren Williams Award, presented annually by the American Psychiatric Association to someone in the U.S. who has furthered the cause of fighting against discrimination toward the mentally ill. He won the award on the basis of three years coverage of attempts by the Ocean Springs (Miss.) Board of Aldermen to prevent a mental health clinic from opening in the city. His reporting helped lead to the Department of Justice finding the City had violated the ADA and discriminated against the mentally ill in denying a permit to the mental health clinic to operate.","bio":"Senior Staff Writer for Al.com.
