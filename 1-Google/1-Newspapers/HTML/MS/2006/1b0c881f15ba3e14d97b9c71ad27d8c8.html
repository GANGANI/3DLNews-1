<p id="h0-p3" class="permalinkable">A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union.</p>

<p id="h0-p4" class="permalinkable">In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.</p>

<p id="h0-p5" class="permalinkable">
</p></p><p id="h0-p6" class="permalinkable"><p id="h0-p7" class="permalinkable">Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.</p>

<p id="h0-p8" class="permalinkable">That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.</p>

<p id="h0-p9" class="permalinkable">The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the Constitution, and was manifested in the well-known Ordinance of 1787, in regard to the Northwestern Territory.</p>

<p id="h0-p10" class="permalinkable">The feeling increased, until, in 1819-20, it deprived the South of more than half the vast territory acquired from France.</p>

<p id="h0-p11" class="permalinkable">The same hostility dismembered Texas and seized upon all the territory acquired from Mexico.</p>

<p id="h0-p12" class="permalinkable">It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction.</p>

<p id="h0-p13" class="permalinkable">It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.</p>

<p id="h0-p14" class="permalinkable">It tramples the original equality of the South under foot.</p>

<p id="h0-p15" class="permalinkable">It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.</p>

<p id="h0-p16" class="permalinkable">It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.</p>

<p id="h0-p17" class="permalinkable">It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.</p>

<p id="h0-p18" class="permalinkable">It has made combinations and formed associations to carry out its schemes of emancipation in the States and wherever else slavery exists.</p>

<p id="h0-p19" class="permalinkable">It seeks not to elevate or to support the slave, but to destroy his present condition without providing a better.</p>

<p id="h0-p20" class="permalinkable">It has invaded a State, and invested with the honors of martyrdom the wretch whose purpose was to apply flames to our dwellings, and the weapons of destruction to our lives.</p>

<p id="h0-p21" class="permalinkable">It has broken every compact into which it has entered for our security.</p>

<p id="h0-p22" class="permalinkable">It has given indubitable evidence of its design to ruin our agriculture, to prostrate our industrial pursuits and to destroy our social system.</p>

<p id="h0-p23" class="permalinkable">It knows no relenting or hesitation in its purposes; it stops not in its march of aggression, and leaves us no room to hope for cessation or for pause.</p>

<p id="h0-p24" class="permalinkable">It has recently obtained control of the Government, by the prosecution of its unhallowed schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship and brotherhood.</p>

<p id="h0-p25" class="permalinkable">Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property. For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the Crown of England.</p>

<p id="h0-p26" class="permalinkable">Our decision is made. We follow their footsteps. We embrace the alternative of separation; and for the reasons here stated, we resolve to maintain our rights with the full consciousness of the justice of our course, and the undoubting belief of our ability to maintain it.</p></p><h3>Previous Comments</h3><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172218</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p27" class="permalinkable">The Public Eye is all about making documents available to the public, so here's a golden oldie. We have wanted to post this one for some time, simply to demonstrate how ridiculous it is to say that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery. Mississippi's legislators certainly thought it was.

Some highlights to that end: "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery."

Then there is this bit of absurd pseudo-science: "These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization."

But my favorite is this: "We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property."

To translate into modern language: "The Unio's trying to steal $4 billion of our property! Never mind that these are people we're talking about."

But of course, everyone knows that the Civil War was really about Northern financial interests seeking unfettered access to Southern and Western markets, right? Not slavery. No, not slavery at all.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Brian Johnson</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-05-07T14:44:49-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172219</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p28" class="permalinkable">Yep, and the institution of slavery—and building wealth by using other human beings for free labor—has nothing whatsoever to do with what wealth and opportunity have been passed down and inherited through the ages, eh?

I find it remarkable, just remarkable when someone makes a dumbass statement that the Civil War wasn't about slavery. As Brian points out, just read the Articles of Secession. And it feels really dumb to even have to point this out. But, hey.

That statement is about as smart as the screech-radio meme of "well, you know black people are better off in this country now because of slavery because it got them away from the savagery of Africa." (You know, the statement in that column Wyatt Emmerich awarded $100 for a while back.)

A. Savagery?!? You help people escape "savagery" by packing them into ships, beating them, killing them, selling them, etc.

B. What moron thinks that Africa would be the same place today, and certainly certain African countries, without the interference of invading nations and the friggin' slave trade. Some of these folks don't deserve a high school diploma because on this bad education.

Does this mean we obsess every day about slavery? Hell, no. We deal with what's on our plate. But that also cannot mean that we revise history to make white guys more comfortable.

Screw comfort. Living free is not about being uncomfortable. It's about fighting to ensure equality and freedom and the same opportunities for everyone.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-05-07T16:38:08-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172220</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p29" class="permalinkable">Growing up in California, we learned that the civil war was about slavery. Period. I recall being taught that the North fought to free the slaves, but the South needed extremely cheap labor for cotton. [California teaching -- at least in the 1970s and 1980s -- was very ego-centric; we spent most of our time learning about the greatness of our own state.]

When I moved to the South (1993), one of the first things I was told was that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery, it was about "states rights, and the right of individual states to make decisions about their own governance. I asked what the state rights issues were. It was quite for a while, and then someone said, "Slavery." That was the end of that discussion. While I have learned more about the Civil War since moving here, I have yet to learn anything that made my simplistic California lesson seem incorrect (expect that not everyone fighting for the North was actually worried about slaves' lives -- although I had figured that out on my own!).

You are right that this isn't an issue we need to discuss daily, but it cannot be forgotten -- or worse, ignored -- either.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Newt</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-05-07T20:26:07-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172221</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p30" class="permalinkable">"These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun.

<i>I believe slavery was a cause of the Civil War, but not The cause.</i>

Slavery was behind the secession and the Confederacy, and therefore the root cause of the war. It wasn't the reason most Confederate soldiers fought, nor was it the reason the North declared war (which was all about preserving the Union until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in late 1862), but it was the root cause of the war.

Let me make this as simple as I can: The South seceded because Abraham Lincoln was elected president and refused to expand slavery into the Western territories, leaving Southern slaveowners concerned about the effects this might have on their slave trade proposals. He had no intention of abolishing slavery in the South, and he repeatedly said so, but just electing an anti-slavery president was enough to bring about the Confederacy.

<i>State rights was a big cause of the war and no one can historically deny that fact. The southern states were being pushed around by the northern states.

Hogwash. You've got a copy of the Mississippi secession document sitting right in front of you saying that the state's right issue in question was slavery; South Carolina's looks the same. Although most Southerners could not afford slaves, Southern legislatures were dominated by slaveowners. And the institution of slavery, whether it might eventually die out or not--and if you read the slavery apologetics documents of the time (which you obviously haven't done), you'll find that most apologists considered it the natural order of things and expected it to last forever--was essential to the slaveowners' livelihood.

<i>The north wanted a big federal goverment.</i>

Again, hogwash. The North imposed a "big federal government" during Reconstruction to (a) rebuild the Southern infrastructure after the war, and (b) enforce equal rights because Southern states refused to honor the spirit of the Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment, necessitating the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

If by "state's rights" you mean slavery (Confederate legislators certainly did!), then this sentence would technically be correct, however little it might have to do with your original argument that slavery was not the primary cause of the war.

<i>That's just how it is.</i>

Sorry, but it ain't. Southern legislators really were nasty buggers. The Civil War really was a massive, expensive, unspeakably violent waste. Read a few more of those so-called revisionist history books and you'll find yourself confronted with that very uncomfortable truth.

Wrong. According to the 1860 census, close to 50 percent of white Mississippians owned slaves.

JSU, don't repost your comments. People ignored them because they were incoherent. You are right when you claim that slavery has a long and widespread history. One thinks of the hundreds of thousands of slaves Julius Caesar sent home from the Gallic Wars. However, it is patently false to claim that "all ethnicities" have "enjoyed the spoils of slavery" since the beginning of "civilization." Many have, some have not.

It is even worse to say that all wars involve "some sort of slavery, physical or mental." The only way you can make this true is by expanding the definition of slavery to such an extent that it's meaningless. How does the Iraq War involve slavery? Oh, it must be "mental" slavery. May I submit that "mental" slavery and "physical" slavery share little in common? That the very term "mental slavery" is ... er, pointless? That it trivializes real slavery?

Only an idiot would say it was not about slavery. Slavery was probably the leading issue. However, it was not the only major reason.

The South opposed a strong centralized government. Its stance was a decentralized one which ironically doomed it in fighting a war.

The population swings towards the north were probably the major reason for the war. the North heavily outnumbered the South in Congress to the point where it could now impose its will on the South.

What you were seeing was Plato's cycle replayed. The commercial class versus the agricultural class. Same thing destroyed the Roman Republic. Same thing destroyed Athens when the oligarchs betrayed Athens to Sparta. North was not JUST abolishing slavery, it was also going to jack up the tariffs. That would have bankrupted the South as well.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T12:30:19-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172238</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p47" class="permalinkable">After the war the tariffs were jacked up and the North pursued very punitive policies that wered esigned to keep the South poor, not just the whites but the blacks as well (example, check the rr freight rates from steel to NO from Birmingham versus from the North until WWII).

Not many Southerners owned slaves. however, Tarriffs also affected EVERYONE as most finished goods were bought from Europe. Same arguements you hear about NAFTA. Tarriffs were the reason for Calhoun's and others stands on states rights.

Keep in mind that there were alot of people that fought not because they believed in slavery but their homeland was also invaded as they saw it. Everyone at that time saw themselves more as Texans or New Yorkers, not Americans. No different than in 200 BC everyone seeing themselve as a Roman, Samnite, or Etruscan compared to 100 AD where everone in central Italy was considered a Roman.

Good interesting book to read is Lost Cause by Pollard. Written by editor of Richmond Examiner during the war as it occurred. Not a whitewash, he slams both Lincoln and Davis and all the hotheads. However, it is good contemporary reading for the time by someone who was a decent writer.

I personally think within 20-30 years slavery was gone away although they couldn't see it back then. Wilbeforce's crusade was bearing fruition and the moral pendulum was swinging against slavery (an institution which was nothing like Roman slavery). Technology would've made it obsolete soon. And at some point Europe would've gotten cheaper cotten from Egypt, India etc. which would've changed the Southern economy anyway.


What the neo Confederates forget is that if the war had not occurred, you would've had a very large, undeducated class of people. PERFECT for Lenin type or a Marxist which is EXACTLY what happened in Russia and China.

To recap, it was not just about slavery. I'd say the top three reasons were population shifts, slavery, tariffs.

I also have an interesting article I can fax from 1961 us news and world report on the effects of the civil war for the next 60 years on the country. very interesting.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T12:32:05-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172239</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p48" class="permalinkable">Damn, you know, I had not thought of that before.

The abolitionist Societies made up about 2 per cent of the northern cause and they were looked on as extremists for the most part same as Focus on the Family is today.

Right. Until it was going to be centered in Richmond—and protect the beloved institution of slavery.

Of course, the Civil War was about slavery—and the economic, government and social apparatus that supported it.

Just like now—we've got all these, er, anti-federal government types in Washington, and what are they doing? Trying to tell states and locals what to do. Centralized is just fine, as long as what's centralized it's your own ideas.

The South was heavily outnumbered by the North in terms of population? That is a myth? Last I checked that was the case in 1860.

The North's economy was more commercial/industrial in nature, ,the Souths agricultural? That was a myth?

So I used the cycle of governments as outlined by Plato and said that the Civil War was a conflict between the Industrial North and Agricultural South? A theme that played out in Rome and Greece and other revolutions/civil wars?

That in no way says that Slavery was not the major cause. I'm saying they were going to come to a conflict of sorts at some point. Slavery was the catalyst. It was the issue that inflamed both sides. However, when I say tarriffs, it had been a bone of contention between the two sides for decades. A major bone of contention at that. Calhoun, Clay, et al all fought vehemently against tarriffs and it was tarriffs that led Calhoun and others to first speak of secession. tarriffs are an underestimated issue and a reading of some of the writings back then will show there was a huge controversy over tarriffs themselves in addition to slavery although slavery was the major cause.

And in terms of the Confederacy, it was much more decentralized. Davis had much less power than Lincoln. Thats not a myth. That is a fact. The irony is that of all the situations a country faces, war is the one that usually calls for a more centralized government.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T13:53:25-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172247</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p56" class="permalinkable">Also Kingfish the Great Compromisers were all dead...Henry Clay and his group and all that was left inthe congress were the folks they compromized for.

In Rome, the farmers held the Senate and held that power jealously. The knights in the assemblies challenged their power. the Optimates and Populaires. Caesar, Marius, Gracchi, Cinna, represented the Populaires, Sulla, Cato, Brutus, etc represented the Optimates (farmers). They naturally engaged in civil wars, this time being two different ideas of who should rule Rome and how it should be governed, that destroyed the Republic.

Same thing in Athens. The business minded Oligarchs fought the more democratic and landed farmers and sold them out to the spartans to end the pelopynessian war. French Revolution: Landed aristicracry versus the business class, which it looked down upon started the whole thing.

we were no different. Slavery was the focal point of the sword upon which the Republic balanced but it was the same battle: commercial class versus business class.

that is NOT whitewashing slavery.

Meaning the Fisks, Goulds, and Vanderbilts extended secure loans and got the Plantations up and running again. Of course guess who did the running. Yes the former slaves.

The problem being that cotton prices slumped as they Brits and French had found new markets for growing it in Egypt, Brazil, India and Africa.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ATLExile</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T16:27:16-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172252</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p61" class="permalinkable">Read Origins of the New South.

Folks (or at least to my fellow southerners), we cannot pass the buck for anything that happened here to another region. There are northerners who behaved badly, but slavery, Jim Crow and the legacy of both are our problems and our history to deal with, repair, atone for and make sure never happens again. We own it.

Kingfish, you have got to read a bit more widely. It's fine to read the apologist stuff, dude, but don't be swept up so easily. There is nothing that can be said that abdicate's the south's respnsibility for Jim Crow and slavery. Nothing.

You just showed your hand. You cannot possibily be equating the position of the plantation owners and the slaves (and I'm matching your generalities here with my own, being that you seem to be trying to generalize away a good chunk of responsibility from the South). This line of reasoning doesn't work.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T16:38:27-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172255</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p64" class="permalinkable">Origins of the New South is not apologist stuff.

News flash Ms. Ladd:

when an army comes through and burns everything in sight and takes all valuables goods, horses etc, everyone is generally destititute. Plantation Owners, slaves, everyone.

In case you never noticed, the South SINCE the civil war has been the poorest region of the country. Think war being fought on your own soil has anything to do with that? Look how long it took Spain to recover from its bloody civil war.

I haven't generalized away any responsiblity from the South. Only thing I said was after the war everyone was pretty much broke. Things didn't really beging to change til FDR came down here and was shocked at the poverty among whites and blacks.

And no where at all have I indicated that slavery was not the main reason for the war. I said there were other reasons and also other forces at play.

If you'd read some Plato and then read a decent amount of history such as Greece, Rome, France, Englad, etc and how their civil wars came about due to class warfare as defined by Plato you would not have thought I was apologizing for the South or dismissing slavery as the major cause.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T16:48:33-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172256</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p65" class="permalinkable">Kingfish, I know *that* part of our history, too, just as well as you do. I have written many times about the "Afghanistanism" of the northern press when it comes to their own racism vs. ours. Everyone. does. it.

That does not, however, mean that any of that excuses what happened right here, and who benefitted from it. Of course, there were plantation owners who were screwed after the Civil War. Of course there were. They had built fortunes on the backs of black people that they owned, and then it was taken away.

The biggest problem here is that you are generalizing about "the north," seemingly to somehow take some of the heat off the South.

As in these statements of yours from above:

<i>also talks about how the north inflamed tensions between the races after the war in the South to keep themselves in power.</i>

Now, as for Woodward. I know he is respected. The problem here isn't him; it's your selective reading of his work. Without that book in front of me, I am going out on a limb and guessing that you have taken this statement of yours out of context:

<i>alot of the former plantation owners were in the same boat as the slaves. </i>

"Same boat"? Really? Did they know where all their family members were? Did some of them have some sort of family ties to help them start over? Did some of them still rest on the mantle of white supremacy to believe they could put their fist in the air and start over because they were, supposedly, "superior" to people they owned and sold? Did a few of them, perhaps, enact Jim Crow in order to regain what it was they lost?

Now, I've said many times that racism is a tragedy to racists and their children; it is horrifying to be taught to hate and to make excuses for hatred. However, in no frackin' way does that mean that the plantation owners were in the <i>boat</i> as the slaves!?! That's a ridiculous, horrifying statement and shows a real void in your understanding of our shared history.

If you don't know how offensive such a statement is—not just to blacks, but to those who refuse to apologize for our history—then I quit.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T17:02:04-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172257</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p66" class="permalinkable">Also, Kingfish, don't tell me to go read Plato to justify what you're saying.

When I say the North what I mean is for the next 40 or so years after the war, the South was prevented to some degree from making a recovery. Woodward covers this some what. This article I quote discloses some interesting facts and I'll be sending you a copy this week. For example, Northerners came up and scooped up timberlands for pennies on the dollar, oilfields for dirt cheap prices and took advantage of the poverty to pillage the natural resources. They fixed the freight rates so that in New Orleans it was cheaper to have steel shipped from Penn. than it was from Birmingham. this prevented the Steel industry in the South from developing. Similar industries were strangled as well.

guess what? this affects both blacks and whites at the time and kept the whole region poor for longer than it should've been. Am I proud of the history of what the politicians did back then? Hell no. Any fool should know that without me having to post that on here. However, I think the treatment of the South after the war, and I am NOT talking nec. about reconstruction, pretty bad.

And when you talk about suffering, keep in mind how many whites who died who didn't own slaves, or women and children who grew up without fathers, husbands etc that had no say so in how the war was conducted or in its even being fought in the first place. Its not like the average white guy had any say so in the politics of the time. Too often he was shut out as well.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T17:11:52-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172259</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p68" class="permalinkable">I figured you've read Plato.

(There are biblical warnings that apply as well.)

But it in no way compares to the horribleness of the institution of slavery and then the south's revenge in the form of Jim Crow. The problem here is the weight you're placing. This is where lingering racism and/or ignorance often gets in the way. You can admit that slavery may have been the cause of the Civil War (good for you; that's more than many apologists will do), but then you feel the need to add that reconstruction was just as bad. Then you say everyone ended up in the same proverbial boat:

<i>I mean, if you are now free but have nothing, and you were a slaveowner but you lost your home, regardless of how it was built, you have no livestock to farm with etc, an dou have nothing, I would say in terms of economics, you're all in the same boat. </i>

OK, freeze frame. You should spend some time in this space. Really, truly think about whether you think that statement is true. This is a good exercise for today's world as well—a world in which many tell us that it doesn't matter how/why the inner cities and horrible black-on-(mostly)black violence came to be. It's about "moral poverty," they say, pointing to the black families who aren't doing their jobs.

But do you think it frackin' started there? Likewise, do you think that the forces that would shape the legacy of the slave-holding south started at the point that the damned Yankees instituted harsh Reconstruction policies? Do you really think at that point that, suddenly, lo and behold, blacks and whites were equal in the South? They would have the same opportunities moving forward? They were all in the same sinking boat?

If that was the case, just how was it that white southerners—including some of those plantation owners, left with nothing—figured out a way to institute harsh black codes and Jim Crow laws that would return blacks to a surrogate slavery state for decades to come, crippling their ability to be educated and learn to build wealth?</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T17:28:50-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172261</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p70" class="permalinkable">Obviously, Kingfish, slavery-Jim Crow-white flight-red-lining-and-so-on were bad for us all.

My point is that the Civil War, slavery, Jim Crow, etc., are tragic, and their legacy still affects us every day. All of us.

We can feel the pain of Jackson being burned by Sherman et al three times, and still not try to equalize the positions of blacks and whites here after the Civil War. That kind of faulty logic does not help us develop a higher understanding that will, some day, help us shake this legacy and cure the problems that linger. Such false equalization makes a very painful, shameful history easier to swallow for white folks, but it does nothing to move us forward.

It is good that you understand that the Civil War was about slavery. It was. Mississippi's Articles of Secession prove it. But what is needed now is a full toolbox to deal with the legacy of slavery, which is a direct cause of the conditions that hold us back today. (And an unapologetic read of our history proves that.) Of course, examining the past won't alone solve our problems, but neither will blaming black families (which have been ripped apart in this state for centuries now); or elected tough-on-crime officials; or improving the education system; or creating jobs; or, or. It takes *all* of these things. And we won't get there if we try to whitewash history to make it sound like blacks and whites were in the same place after the Civil War ended.That sets us off on the wrong track—and, frankly, leads to a lot of the faulty thinking that holds us back today. I'm not saying that is all your motive to do—I can tell that it is not. But this is one of those places where asking ourselves if we are purposefully trying NOT to be racist is more useful than asking ourselves if we are being racist, as I talked about on the George Allen thread.

OK, I'm officially out of words. Later.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-25T18:01:25-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172264</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p73" class="permalinkable">Tom Head said:

To say that there was "equality" after the Civil War, or even, Ironghost, after 1964, is like saying that women automatically had equal rights, equal access to education and equal access to power after they were granted the right to vote less than a century ago.

If we don't understand our past, distant and recent, then we refuse to recognize what we have to do in order to truly equalize things. You don't declare equality, and that's the end of it. Anyone who, well, faces and undertands history knows that.

You can't go forward without studying and learning from the past. Interestingly, that's one of the biggest lessons of studying history. Thus, the Mississippi riddle I like to speak up: you move forward by looking toward the past and then back forward again.

let me see, army comes through, burns down everything in sight. war is over, no one has anything. Seems pretty clear cut to me. South was poorest part of country and still is. Freed slaves had nothing really. And except for a few rich whites who had somehow escaped the fortunes of the war to some degree, the whites were pretty bad off too. That is simply all I said from an economic point of few. I'm not talking about education, family ties etc.

people forget that there was not much of a middle class. Mainly poor and rich and I have a feeling the poor whites after the war were pretty bad off too, in addition to the freed Black.

if that makes me a racist for saying that, well, then go *********. I didn't think it was racist to point out that when war is fought in an area it tends to level everything for the most part. And the Civil war in terms of economics tended to level everything.

NOW that may have accented racism. People that are pretty poor like to see themselves as better than someone else too often. Keep in mind, the average white guy was not a plantation owner. If he was a shopkeeper, he had no one really that could afford to buy his goods, if he could now afford to get them (remember the tarriffs? His costs went way up). The average white guy working as a farmer probably couldn't afford to own slaves. Suddenly his crops are destroyed, no horse or livestock. How does he live? Or if he was killed during the war? repeat it over and over. You have alot of destitute whites as well. Its not racist to point it out. Only racist if you make it sound like they are the only ones that suffered and that is clearly not the case. Slavery went on a lot longer than did the war obviously.

It really is OK (and quite freeing, really) to admit that slavery and what it caused was bad for all Americans and much worse for black Americans. I actually don't think you're far from being able to do that—you've just throw up a rationalization that says that, yes, slavery was bad and led to the Civil War—but since then everything has been equal because everyone was poor (which they weren't, but that's another story). Of course it hasn't been level, and it wasn't then. And it certainly wasn't when southern whites turned around and re-instituted a legal form of slavery called Jim Crow, which lasted until the late 1960s and caused many of the problems of today.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-26T11:52:05-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172278</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p87" class="permalinkable">Duh, Kingfish.

He stunned me by saying this was a Great Depression for white folks and that blacks lived the great depression at all times back then with very few exceptions.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Ray Carter</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-26T12:13:28-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172280</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p89" class="permalinkable">Ray makes a good point.

Here is one myth: South was richer than the North.

North:            South:
States:    23               11
People:   22 mill.          9 mill, including 3.5 million slaves
factories:  100K          20K
$$ (bank deposits) 189 mill  47 million

manuf. workers: 1.1 mil      .111 mill
wealth in property: 11 bill.     5.4 billion.

sufficeth to say, one myth is that South was richer than North. How many necks have we heard say that? South reflected what you would expect above of an agricultural society versus an industrial one.

Nearly a million whites starved in first year of war. No relief sent.

Congress levied a tax on cotton that took 70 million dollars from Southern farmers first three years after the war. (my note: keep in mind that tarriffs were instituted so blacks and whites were hit with a double whammy, tax on cotton and tax on finished goods)

Special trains were run from North bringing speculators who plundered. 5.7 million of southern timberland was bought up for as little as 25 cents an acre

Cotton was left UNPROTECTED from foreign competition (hello Bush) and northern industrial goods got tariffs. Cotton dropped to 5 cents a lb in1890s.

Southern railroads were bought up by northerners. Discriminatory freight rates were introduced until it was impossible for southern industries to compete. This was the case until US SC decision in 1945.

Freedmans bureau took in 4 dollars for ever 1 dollar in aid it gave.

Carptebaggers built up state debts to the tune of $101 million by 1874. Mississippi's tax rates for example, were 14 times higher at the end than the beginning.

Your arguments are all over the place. We can clearly stipulate that the South was left devastated by the Civil War. There were some resulting problems in the north as well.

So please stop trying to convince us of something we already know to be true. That's like arguing with the wall, and is a waste of energy.

What's more interesting here is the idea that blacks and white were left "level" by the war. That's a harmful and naive misperception that doesn't help us deal with slavery's legacy.

I do know you would be offended at a suggestion of racism here, which I'm not making, but I don't think that's your motivation. But you ought to back up a few steps and read all your posts taken together and consider how they might sound. You are doing backflip and making all sorts of illogical leaps in order to, seemingly, make it sound like whites were as bad off as blacks after slavery/Civil War. Why do that, when it's clearly not true? When someone makes these kind of arguments, that are based in ignorance and wishful thinking, it is exactly the point where you get accused of being an "apologist" (or worse). Instead of simplly acting defensively, maybe try some self-examination and hard consideration of the arguments you've made and the generalizations you've based on them. There is something to be learned here about why our race dialogue is so bad in this country—and a whole lot of it has to be with white people's shame and desire to never have to face the awful things that our ancestors did to other people. Thus, we choose denial and revisionist arguments about how things were "level" after the Civil War.

It's just not good enough, Kingfish.

Also, I don't think poverty equalizes everything. I think we are progressing, slowly, but to say that society is somehow fundamentally equalized right now just goes against my own experience. It would be great if we were all living in a meritocracy, but we're not.

I've been the only women in any number of business situations, and I can tell you without a doubt that there is an abundance of sexism in the workplace, both institutional and personal. One that sticks in my head as a stupid example of stereotyping. On a committee, volunteering to help put on an event. We needed brochures, posters, coffee mugs, etc created. The Chair of the event asked me to do it because "women are always better at that kind of thing." As in, I'm supposed to be better at graphic design because I'm a woman? The hell? I have the design sense of a flea. Now flip that around, and imagine what jobs this guy was not giving to women, because women just "aren't good at" math, negotiation, strategic planning, etc.

If I may quote myself:

<i>We often hear that only a tiny percentage of whites held slaves, but that was not true of the Deep South. Nearly half of all white Mississippians owned slaves: of 63,015 white households, 30,943 of them held slaves, according to the 1860 census. There were more than 436,000 slaves in Mississippi, or 55 percent of the total population. In Hinds County alone, 1,421 white households held 22,363 slaves, the highest slave-to-master ratio in Mississippi and the ninth highest in the South.</i>

Here in Mississippi, both the very rich and the merely comfortable owned slaves. The difference is between owning 100 slaves and only one.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Brian C Johnson</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T11:33:55-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172295</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p104" class="permalinkable">The citation was from an <a href="https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/comments.php?id=9468_0_7_0_C">opinion piece</a> I wrote a while back.

I also need to write a few words about the idea of the playing field being leveled between blacks and whites. Of course, this is asanine, but let me give some examples of why. One, sharecropping. There were parts of rural Mississippi where slaves were still held as late as 1870. Even where slaves were emancipated, most were illiterate as a direct consequence of slavery. So they were robbed blind by their white masters--I mean, business partners.

Two, convict leasing. After reconstruction, the state Legislature passed laws that made it illegal for blacks to do--well, just about anything. For instance, drinking liquor. Also, stealing a bag of chicken feed--don't know why that example comes to mind--could get a black a sentence of five years or more in state prison. So you have horrible poverty among blacks, who were turned out without any institutional assistance whatsoever, and if they got hungry and took a chicken, they went to prison for five years. White people were <i>never</i> convicted for these crimes. Once the black man or woman was convicted (with dispatch), they were then leased to plantation owners. Virtually none of this leased labor made it through the five years, because the plantation owners had no economic incentive to keep them alive. If a convict died, the owner just got another.

Three, highly organized violence by whites against blacks. In Vicksburg, even before Reconstruction ended, a black government was turned out of power by a white militia--I think they called themselves the Redeemers. When the black sheriff tried to resist, the militia gunned him down along with his men. No one was ever punished for this, of course.

The list could go on and on.

If you want to argue that the North was also racist, you've got no argument from me. Nevertheless, the issue was slavery, if not necessarily the slaves themselves. What I mean is that it was chiefly religious sentiment, i.e. that slavery was an abomination to God, that drove Northern sentiment. That does not mean that Northerners wanted to have anything to do with blacks, as they amply showed after the war. But it deeply offended them that other white people thought it was OK to hold slaves. I don't think there's any way of evading that fact.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Brian C Johnson</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T11:53:09-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172296</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p105" class="permalinkable"><i>I think the core of my beef with this debate is the idea that somehow, just by virtue of skin color whites have always had it better than blacks.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining</a>

Turn the argument on its head. Yes...*certain whites* could do better than *other whites.*

But what if black folks were *systematically denied* the opportunity to do better for themselves at all?

In other words, we'd have to rephrase what you're saying about to "just by virtue of skin color, blacks have, historically, had it worse than nearly all whites."

It's probably fair to say that the most significant wealth-building investment that the typical working or middle-class family makes is real estate. But let's get in the WayBack machine and put ourselves in, say, the 1940s, 50s, 60s or, hell, the 70s. With institutional redlining in this country, living in the wrong part of town and/or with the wrong skin color meant you couldn't get a mortgage. Not a signature loan, not a credit card (again, as we can see here from the portal window of the WayBack machine, credit cards that we know-and-hate these days were in their infancy even in the 1970s), not a student loan...not anything you could, perhaps, work hard enough to save for and overcome through diligence...but a mortgage. You know, the sort of loan that most people couldn't save for 20 years and still cover. That once-in-a-lifetime long-term loan that gets you a roof over your head and the opportunity to pour your rent money into something that, hopefully, would be an appreciating asset.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>iTodd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T12:21:06-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172297</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p106" class="permalinkable">In the modern era, redlining and Jim Crow kept black people (all over the country, but in a more pronounced way in the South) from *building wealth* both individually and within their communities. Without wealth in a household and/or a community, investment and infrastructure suffer, education suffers, making that future brighter for your children suffers.

Wealth-building begins for many, many Americans with that mortgage for a home or small business. But what happens when the goverment literally institutionalizes policies that essentially guarantee you can't get that loan, even if you work as hard and manage money as responsibly as someone of a different race who is otherwise in the same economic boat as you are?

That's where we are now...we have a disparate distribution in wealth even within the communities right here in Jackson, where, historically, whites have been given access to the Horacio Alger's "bootstraps" while blacks have not. Hopefully, the law since 1977 (the Community Reinvestment Act) has given a new, first generation of middle-class blacks the opportunity to build wealth, which could translate into strong community assets in the future.

Other than that, you may want to try that site that Todd referred you to, and see if you can't find your own data on predatory lending practices.

And, even if, as you imply, that in the past decade, the practice has completely been done away with, I don't think that means that the playing field is level.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>kate</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T15:33:23-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172306</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p115" class="permalinkable">Playing field right now for getting a mortgage is VERY level.

To get a good rate it is all computer driven now. Most mortgage companies are tied in to Fannie Mae/ Freddie Mac/HUD in their computer systems. You enter the loan application data and if it meets certain criteria, you are approved for a mortgage.

Race is NOT considered. If you pay your bills on time and thus have a decent credit score (600 or above in most cases), haven't overloaded yourself with debt, you can get a mortgage for a good rate regardless of race.

there is no reason a minority borrower can not walk into a mortgage company if he has paid his bills on time for a while, has been responsible in managing his debt and get a decent rate.

Now he doesn't even have to put money down for a mortgage so that dispels the idea that they are poor and have not been able to save money. You can adjust the rate to cover closing costs.

There are reasons why minorities have a harder time getting mortgages but that too often is due to their financial criteria. Sorry, if you have a bunch of late payments on your credit report, lenders are going to think twice about lending to you. If 60% of your gross income is wasted on credit card, SUV payments, etc ( and that is not even including taxes) and rent, then its hard to see how you can manage a mortgage. I've even seen 80%.

However, if you meet the criteria I laid out, you can get a mortgage for a good rate.

By the way, this whole post or any related discussion is my PERSONAL opinion and experience and is not the official policy or practice of any business.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T15:42:16-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172307</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p116" class="permalinkable">You live in an ideal world, Kingfish.

Keep in mind when you read headlines no one is seeing the credit reports. You can have the best looking loan application in the world but if that credit report and tax return says something else, then its worthless.

Too often the predatory lending is done by a mortgage broker who takes the loan application, HE is the one who puts the borrower into a mortgage program. He is the one who decides how much in fees to charge and has SOME but not unlimited discretion in what rate to charge. Now, he can choose to put the borrower into a subprime program which has higher rates (keep in mind, these are riskier loans in general which is why the rates are higher PLUS since they are not backed by Fannie, they tend to reflect the markets true value of them).

The borrower should always pull his own credit report with a score and go to three mortgage companies/banks. Shop around like anything else.

I will say this, some of the worst predatory lending in this town has been from minority brokers. A former councilman's son was pretty bad at charing fees. No one on this board will want to hear that but its true. What I recommend is asking each mortgage company who their conforming lenders are and who their subprime lenders are. If they don't have any conforming lenders, then that tells you right there the chances for predatory lending are higher as they don't have the ability to offer good rates.

Keep in mind the lender only knows what is placed in front of him by the mortgage company. Its the mortgage company that has the choice to select the lender and decide the program and rate.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:02:47-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172309</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p118" class="permalinkable">There are several prosecutions going on right now for predatory lending, some white, some minority defendants.

I've seen alot of predatory lending and fraud. I can tell you for the most part race doesn't have much to do with it. It is usually someone who sees an opportunity to take advantage of someone who has bad credit OR has good credit, good financial statements, BUT sticks them into higher fee higher rate program and takes advantage of him because he is not sophisticated and has not shopped around.

However, right now, if the mortgage company is ethical, there is no reason now why a minority borrower with good financial background can not get a good rate Ray. The lenders are trying hard to improve the diversity of their borrowers (and some programs I think are a little too risky in furthering this goal) and want the business. I'm a little wary of redlining claims now when the people making the claims do not have access to credit scores and other info.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:08:42-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172310</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p119" class="permalinkable">by the way Ray, I'm not living in an ideal world.

You go to Community Bank, Trustmark, Mortgage Connection, Realty, Mortgage 1st, AMC Mortgage, FMC, and other similar mortgage companies/banks that is exactly how you will be treated.

However, someone who has a credit score of 520 and no money to put down on a house is probably going to have some trouble getting a mortgage.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:13:14-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172311</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p120" class="permalinkable"><i>however, I am stating how it really is</i>

With due respect, I'm not sure you could do that if you tried. Remember, you're the guy who doesn't understand the connection between economics and education.

Also, Kingfish, you have completely missed the point about redlining—do you understand that?</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:17:23-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172312</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p121" class="permalinkable">Kingfish, I understand what you're saying.

Who said it was? I certainly think that it's important to watch the banks, as they've consolidated dramatically in the past decade (in part due to deregulation) and as part of that consolidation, many of them are now doing less in community redevelopment than their separate parts had done before consolidation. And, second, part of the CRA works with the assumption that the community will watch and complain about lending practices, so while it's interesting that they're all done "by computer" these days, I don't think that exactly mitigates the need for oversight. Thirdly, Republicans in Congress are often trying to chip away at existing financial oversight legislation, including aspects of the CRA, as you'd see if you visit that amazing little website I mentioned early.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>iTodd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:22:31-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172314</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p123" class="permalinkable">But, what's going on RIGHT NOW is also entirely beside the point.

The result has been that black families have been systematically denied access to capital and the opportunity at standard-issue American "bootstrap" opportunities until very recently in our country's past. Ergo, historically, poverty has not been a "great equalizer" when the color of your family's skin held sway over whether or not your family was allowed to climb out of it.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>iTodd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:22:54-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172315</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p124" class="permalinkable">Todd makes a good point, Kingfish.

Ms Ladd: Where have I said education had nothing to do with economics? Only a fool, which I am not, would say that one has nothing to do with the other.

Todd, there is ALOT of community lending going on. I can sit with you at your computer, take you through the websites of the major lenders and you'd be surprised at how much is available.

About the only way you can not get a mortgage now is if you have really really bad credit. You can even get 100% financing down to a 580 score with some lenders. What is crazy is some of these programs that were pushed around here a few years ago where someone was leasing a house for 15 years, then it would count towards a mortgage or however it worked. That was just plain nuts and bad for the renter/homeowner.

However, Todd, I will take issue with one thing you wrote. Its hard for a community to complain about fair lending when they don't see the private info, including the credit report.

What NEEDS to happen is better education of the minority community. If you pay rent, use checks so you can show a payment history. If you go out and buy a nice SUV with a 500 dollar a month payment, its going to count against you (notice how much marketing is now towards getting minorities to spend their discretionary income on such toys). You have a credit score and here is how it can help/hurt you.

anyway, sorry for the tagent.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>Kingfish</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T17:35:40-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172317</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p126" class="permalinkable">actually no Miss Ladd, not add. just reading through a few posts and saw that so thought I would explore it a little since I am in the business.


However, I will return to point. When I said poverty was a great equalizer, I meant in terms of class/economics. I meant it very narrowly however as access to education, jobs, basic rights, etc do have a bearing in your ability to improve your lot in life. Any serious reader of Hayek would realize that is the case and numerous Conservative/Libertarian writers have stated how the South's policies after the war held it back and was stupid.

I meant it purely as a still photo snapshot in time. South was devastated, most everyone was dead broke and poor.

Kingfish, on this very thread, you tried to make the argument that economics were "leveled" between blacks and whites after the Civil War—and then vehemently stated that you weren't talking about clearly unleveled areas such education, giving the strong impression that you were clueless that illiterate slaves might actually be at a disadvantage economically.

Good to see you don't read your own posts carefully, either.

Yes, your tangent is only clouding (or avoiding) an issue that you seem very uncomfortable with—the fact that very-recent discrimination against blacks, such as redlining, has left the playing field very unlevel.

That is a fact, Kingfish, no matter how you try to twist it.

Your still snapshot wasn't accurate, though. You don't seem to understand that all races can be poor (not that that is exactly accurate, post-Civil War, either but we'll ignore that for the moment), and that one race can still be in a far worse place.

And at this point, an arrogant statement like "any serious reader of ..." just sounds silly, Kingfish. I suggest you become a serious reader of your own posts, and others, before venturing out into a more complicated place. Based on your interpretations here, why would we trust your reading of ... anything?

Isn't that an obvious statement? Obviously, poor whites suffer as well. I come from a long line of poor whites. I also am not too proud (or naive) to admit that I got breaks and opportunities that poor blacks did not get when I was growing up—because I was white and blonde. Realizing that doesn't make me hate being white—or try to blame every white guy for every act of prejudice ever committed; what it does do is help me reject simplistic arguments that everything is equal now (or right after the Civil War, to hear Kingfish tell it), so get over it.

What's hard to stomach is the white defensiveness that tries to argue that nothing that ever happened in regard to slavery or Jim Crow still has an effect today. That is simply absurd and intellectually dishonest. Worse, such an attitude sets up all back.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T21:22:59-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172323</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p132" class="permalinkable">Oh, did I confuse you?

<i>I know we're arguing racism here, I was pointing out there's a chance more than blacks suffered economically, despite the insistance that it's all the white man's fault.</i>

Well, ya know, it's really hard to argue that it's not all pretty much the white man's fault up through at least the 1960s, if not beyond that. I refer you here to the U.S. Constitution, the Mississippi Constitution, the Fugitive Slave Acts, the Southern Baptist Convention...um...Jim Crow, the Housing Act of 1934, the Council of Conservative Citizens...and, um...John Tesh.

Seriously. WTF?

(A.) Some Southern whites suffered after the Civil War
and
(B.) nearly all Southern blacks suffered after the Civil War, largely at the hands of unprecedented institutionalized racism,
therefore
(C.) It's not all the "white man's fault" (whatever the hell that is in context).

Care to craft an argument that's a bit more logical?</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>iTodd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T21:35:26-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172324</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p133" class="permalinkable">Newsflash to defensive white folks: Our peeps acted very badly through American history, causing a legacy of serious problems for black folks (not to mention Native Americans, but we'll save that one for another time).

You're joking, Iron, right? On what planet are white folks the "only people blamed for current conditions."

Black families, that were ripped apart for generations by laws and practices of white supremacists, are constantly blamed for "current conditions."

Why is it that every time someone asks a defensive white guy to simply take some responsibility for the "current conditions" it means that they personally are being blamed for every bad thing that has ever happened? What is really on the table here is whether or not defensive white folks are willing to *stop* blaming the victims in this country, region and state, and actually take some responsibility for helping solve the problems, instead of making it impossible to get there because they are so damned hypersensitive that they can't admit that "it's" *not* everyone's fault.

Look, I know our forebears tried to instill this kind of defensiveness in us to make them feel better about their cruelty, but we don't have to keep playing along.</p></dd><dt>Author</dt><dd>ladd</dd><dt>Date</dt><dd>2006-09-27T22:05:29-06:00</dd></dl><dl><dt>ID</dt><dd>172330</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd><p id="h0-p139" class="permalinkable">I'm not really sure how to continue the argument.
