		</script><p>We often get asked to review the truth about Garcinia Cambogia&#8230;and with 2016 New Year&#8217;s resolutions for weight loss and burning fat always seeing a spike &#8211; what a better time to write an overview about the most popular, sold and bought weight loss supplement of all time.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. No one outside of a lab had ever heard about <a href="http://supplementpolice.com/garcinia-cambogia">garcinia</a> until leading T.V. doctor, Dr.Oz, mentioned it out of the blue that it could help you lose weight and burn stubborn belly fat. And in October 2012, it became an instant hit overnight because of Oz’s medical authority and large following. He’s one of the best heart surgeons in the country. He must be right. Right? Let’s see. In this article we will evaluate the claimed benefits that Garcinia Cambogia has for you. We will dispel myths and actually clarify what it really does &#8211; and answer if 2016 garcinia cambogia weight loss debate to see if you should bring in the new year with malabar tamarind fruit extract.</p>
<p>There’s only one claim that you should care about. And, that being if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxycitric_acid">this</a> is a powerful fat burner or not. Many have said that this is a treatment to obesity. As obesity rates climb higher and higher, it’s quite the statement to make.</p>
<p>Hydroxycitric acid is the primary ingredient within Garcinia Cambogia that is claimed to cause rapid weight loss. Let’s see if it can truly reduce appetite and burn fat.</p>
<p>It’s quite controversial as well. Some are adamant that it works. Others are completely against it and call it a sham. There’s also the negative side effects supporters don’t talk about, that is associated with the supplement. (Ex: dry mouth, headaches, fainting, and feeling dizzy.)</p>
<p>No more fluff. Let’s get straight to the chase. Here’s the truth about Garcinia Cambogia. We are only going to look at the scientific studies behind this supplement and nothing else. Anecdotal evidence doesn’t count. Only the science.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is &#8216;Garcinia Cambogia Extract&#8217;?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>First, we need to know what it is. The source of the supplement comes from a plant called Garcinia-gummi-gutta. The gummi gutta comes from a tree called Garcinia subelliptica. The origins of this tree comes from Indonesia and other countries neighboring it. It is commonly sour and extremely bitter. The ancient people of Southeast Asia would use this to make their food tastier.</p>
<p>It’s already established that Garcinia Cambogia has some properties that provide medicinal use. It can be used to treat digestive problems and eradicate parasites within that resides in your body. It is quite possible that people confused these properties with losing weight. (This isn’t the case if you read more down below.)</p>
<p>What’s funny is that actual scientists, no longer use the name Garcinia Cambogia. The official term is garcinia gummi-gutta. It is also known as brindleberry, Malabar tamarind, and kudam puli. Garcinia Cambogia is only used within the supplements industry.</p>
<p>It looks like a mini pumpkin.</p>
<p>It’s a popular fruit that is used in Southeast Asian and African cuisine. Commonly used in preparing curry to enhance the flavor of food.</p>
<p>The fruit has historic roots. The Ancient Indian people would utilize it as a remedy for a variety of health issues. It would be used to cure headaches, treat digestive problems, and to cleanse the body of toxins.</p>
<p>It was virtually unknown until Dr.Oz brought it up in one of his TV segments. The reason? That it didn’t require diet or exercise for you to lose weight. That probably got a bunch of people excited. People want a quick and easy solution. The issue that quick and easy solutions rarely exist. People will sell you the dream and take your money.</p>
<p>However, garcinia cambogia hca extract is a real fruit and also known as  malabar tamarind, here&#8217;s a video to show it growing:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/599NHp2OVL8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Pros of Garcinia Cambogia</strong></p>
<p>A study conducted by Purdue University, has found that Garcinia Cambogia is rich in vitamins such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Calcium</li>
<li>Phosphorus</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Thiamine</li>
<li>Niacin</li>
<li>Riboflavin</li>
</ul>
<p>These substances have extensive health benefits to the human body. However, what’s to be noted is that it isn’t directly connected with weight loss. Ignore them. If you want these vitamins look for other sources.</p>
<p>A vast majority of people are however saying that the hydroxycitric acid or known as HCA, is the primary component that creates weight loss. Other claims include: prevents weight gain, reduces appetite, reduces the risk of diabetes, increases metabolic efficiency, gets rid of ulcers and so much more.</p>
<p>Here’s the actual scientific evidence.</p>
<h2><strong>The Garcinia Weight Loss Evidence..Does It Exist?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>There hasn’t been lot of research on Garcinia Cambogia &#8211; but there are a handful of highly cited and credible studies of noteworthy discussion.  Therefore, the research is limited. This should be a warning sign for people who care about the evidence. Limited evidence will only tell you so much. Here’s an example of limited evidence in action.</p>
<p>You are in a dark room. You can’t see anything but a slimmer of light. You feel a hard round object on what looks to be a basketball. This is limited evidence. The limited evidence being the lack of visibility. When you actually get some more light on, you’ll see that what you thought was a basketball is actually a coconut. More evidence needs to be gathered for anything to be definitive.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association conducted a study on HCA in 1998. The conclusion? <strong>Garcinia Cambogia did not produce significant weight loss for the subjects. </strong>This study showed that Garcinia Cambogia did not provide any weight loss benefits.</p>
<p>What’s interesting to note is that future studies have conflicted this result. That is the nature of science. The study got criticized by a researcher named Harry Preuss. Preuss said that the study used the <strong>wrong HCA. </strong>This is a red flag. If the wrong HCA was used then the study is invalid. You put in wrong data and you’ll get wrong results. That’s how it works.</p>
<p>Another, criticism is that too much fiber was used in the study. Scientists believe that fiber can mess up the results, as it interferes with HCA. A combination of these factors ends up making the study invalid.</p>
<h4><strong>The Second Study</strong></h4>
<p>Scientists in Japan conducted a study in the year 2003. They did not experiment on humans but on mice. It’s remember to know that mice are genetically altered to have identical genes to humans. What is tested on mice will have a high chance of yielding the same effect on a human.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the study was that <strong>Garcinia Cambogia had no connection with weight loss.</strong> However, other effects were discovered. It decreased insulin and leptin levels. Insulin controls your blood sugar levels while leptin is responsible for controlling your appetite.</p>
<p>This study indicates that the claims of Garcinia Cambogia of being an appetite suppressant is <strong>true. </strong>However, this is not the case when talking about diabetes. Generally speaking, more insulin is a good thing for the human body. Insulin is used as a stabilizing force for your blood sugar levels. This is why people who do not have diabetes do not experience high/low blood pressure. Insulin provides balance. Garcinia Cambogia is counterproductive if you want to cut the risk of diabetes.</p>
<h4><strong>The Third Study</strong></h4>
<p>The researcher Preuss conducted his own study after he saw the inaccurate study conducted before. His study is interesting. The study concluded that <strong>Garcinia Cambogia provides rapid weight loss among overweight people and is an adequate way of suppressing appetite. </strong>It appears that Garcinia Cambogia is especially effective if you are overweight. Bonus points for appetite suppression as that’s a common problem overweight people experience.</p>
<h4><strong>The Fourth Study</strong></h4>
<p>Preuss re-did his study over to determine the validity of his previous experiments. He got identical results. Overweight subjects experienced substantial weight loss and suppressed appetite.</p>
<h4><strong>The Fifth Study</strong></h4>
<p>Preuss conducted another study with other doctors. The study’s quite complicated. If you ate the HCA in its natural form you would be getting less results. Within its natural form, HCA is connected to calcium. If you extracted the substance and combined it with salt – you got better results. Eating the actual fruit isn’t as effective. It needs to be artificially altered. The HCA + salt, is called HCA-SX.</p>
<p>It actually confirmed most of the claims that people make about Garcinia Cambogia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased happiness. (Could be used to treat depression.)</li>
<li>Suppressed appetite</li>
<li>Improved blood circulation</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of obesity</li>
</ul>
<p>If you combined HCA with salt you got all the powerful results that people claimed it have. Perhaps, Dr.Oz is onto something here…</p>
<h4><strong>What did we learn from these studies?</strong></h4>
<p>Here are a couple of things we learned from these studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydroxycitric acid is the primary component behind any significant amount of weight loss that a person experiences, when consuming this supplement.</li>
<li>The other minerals/vitamins in Garcinia Cambogia are too small to provide any substantial benefits compared to HCA.</li>
<li>HCA in its natural form isn’t really that effective.</li>
<li>HCA is most effective when combined with salt.</li>
<li>More research needs to be done before anything is definitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s lot of positive studies about Garcinia Cambogia. More research will be done as there’s a huge interest in it. A lot of people want to believe that this supplement will be great for weight loss, without the need for diet and exercise. Lot of money in it as well.</p>
<h2><strong> Garcinia Cambogia HCA Extract Facts:<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You are probably convinced. This supplement might help you lose weight. Back up. There’s still another problem that we haven’t discussed. <strong>You need to be careful where you buy it from. </strong>There are hundreds if not thousands of companies selling this supplement. They are banking on this heavily popular substance. And the sorry but very real situation, most do not contain the <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/197920/">active HCA extract</a> ingredient or optimal dosing.</p>
<p>What needs to be noted that not all garcinia is equally accountable. All of these companies haven’t been evaluated by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) whatsoever. The FDA classified supplements as something they can’t regulate. Their view is that supplements are not a food or drug. Therefore, they cannot regulate it. (Which is debatable. However, that’s their ruling and stance.)</p>
<p>This is why there are so many supplement companies out there. There’s no little to no regulation in the supplement industry. This can be quite dangerous for consumers. If the companies who sell it aren’t held to some kind of standard – they might as well put whatever they want in it. Unfortunately, people believe in their claims and buy ineffective product. And, this means they won’t be getting the optimal results associated with garcinia cambogia. It’s a shame really.</p>
<p>This means that companies don’t really have to put much garcinia inside it. Most garcinia supplements contain very little garcinia cambogia inside. Instead, it’s replaced via caffeine and other ingredients that don’t do anything. Do you really want to take something that doesn’t even have the ingredient that makes it work? It’d be foolish to do so. That’s why you should be willing to pay more money for supplements that actually contain the ingredient. Do your research carefully.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I properly buy it then? </strong></h3>
<p>Here’s how. <strong>Buy a Garcinia Cambogia supplement that has 50%+ HCA.</strong> This will allow you to get the maximum results associated with hydroxycitric acid. Look carefully at the amount of HCA inside the supplement. If there isn’t 50%+ then it’s not worth buying.</p>
<p>There’s also one more thing you need to look at as well. <strong>Look at how you take the supplement.</strong> This can make or break the results you get from garcinia. Do it wrong and you’ll get no results. Do it right and you will get phenomenal results.</p>
<p>Dr. Oz unfortunately was wrong about one thing. You do actually need to do exercise + proper dieting, in order to get the most optimal results with this supplement. This is what the research has indicated. You can’t sit in the couch and eat chips while watching TV. Exercise and dieting is extremely important for this to work.</p>
<p>All of the data concludes that with proper dieting + exercise, and using the supplement – you’ll achieve faster weight loss then the people who don’t take the supplement. It’s a nice advantage to have over other people. That doesn’t mean you’ll lose weight if you don’t do any dieting and exercise. You’ll experience some weight loss. However, it’s important to remember that you won’t get the best results out of this supplement.</p>
<p>Weight loss comes down to burning more calories than you consume. Garcinia Cambogia can assist with this effort. Although many major news publications are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2015/12/07/the-top-five-supplements-you-should-not-take/">starting to shed light on garcinia</a> supplementation not being the best route to take.</p>
<h3><strong>Capsule vs Liquid </strong></h3>
<p>There’s two ways you can take the supplement: capsule form and liquid form. It’s a matter of preference of which form you want to take. However, it’s generally established that consuming vitamin/mineral/supplements in liquid form is much more effective and easier to absorb.</p>
<p>The liquid form will be much more potent so be careful when using it. Take the supplement 10-15 minutes before you eat a meal. Take about 20 drops of the stuff or 1 ml of it. Do this for all the big meals you eat.</p>
<p>The proper dosage when taking capsule form is 500 mg to 1100 mg. Take them a half an hour before eating anything.</p>
<p>If you don’t follow these instructions then you’ll find that the substance isn’t as effective.</p>
<p>It is best that you get the liquid form as it is much faster to take effect. It’s all up to you though. Use what makes you more comfortable.</p>
<h3><strong>The Dangers of Garcinia Cambogia Side Effects<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>What isn’t talked enough is the dangers associated with this supplement. The scientific studies that were conducted shows no significant negative effects associated with the substance. Only minor ones were reported such as headaches, feeling nauseous, and issues with digestion. These issues happened in a minority of cases and disappeared after the use of garcinia stopped.</p>
<p>The dangerous side effects that you might experience aren’t actually a result of the garcinia. It’ll be because of the low quality stuff that you might buy when shopping. Many companies often replace the HCA with caffeine. The issue is that they put high traces of caffeine in them. This can be quite dangerous if you have any issues with your heart and blood pressure. Caffeine isn’t exactly good if you have those conditions. The filler substances are especially dangerous. Putting the filler substances is cheaper than putting actual HCA. It’s important to research where you get your supplements. A high concentration of HCA and using the compound HCA-SX will reduce the risks of adverse side effects.</p>
<p>The only person that will care about you is you. These companies have no interest in giving you a proper opinion, nor do they care about what they put inside them. They aren’t properly regulated, so no one’s going to hold them accountable.</p>
<p>Stop taking this supplement if you do experience any massive side effects. Consult a medical professional if you have any problems with your health. It is best that you talk with your doctor to see if garcinia is right for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: Is Garcinia Right For You?<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Here are the key takeaways you need to know after you finished this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies have indicated that Garcinia Cambogia is an effective weight loss supplement for overweight people. It is best used in combination with diet and exercise. HCA is the primary component that does the weight loss.</li>
<li>A compound called HCA-SX is more effective than the natural HCA that is found within the fruit. The altered compound is what you should take.</li>
<li>The FDA doesn’t regulate the supplements industry. Therefore, a huge variety of garcinia that is sold aren’t held to a standard. Companies can put whatever they inside. It is important to purchase supplements that contain 50%+ HCA-SX. This will give you the best results.</li>
<li>Can increase the risk of diabetes and is an effective appetite suppressant.</li>
<li>Not enough research has been done on the substance to definitely say that it is 100% true. The current research indicates that Garcinia Cambogia is an effective weight loss solution for overweight people. This information might change in the future as more research is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember to look at the facts and nothing else. There’s a lot of people out there who don’t have the best interests in your heart. The only person that cares about you the most is you. Always be careful what other people say. Look at the evidence.</p>
<p>The evidence is the closest thing to the truth you will ever find. There are many shady companies that sell this supplement, that don’t even contain the substance that does the weight loss. That’s because all they care about is your money and not the results you get from the substance.</p>
<p>There really isn’t a magical one size fit all solution. Everything is determined by a case by case basis. Maybe this supplement is for you. Maybe it isn’t. Consult a doctor and find out. The current research shows that it might help you out. However, there’s no guarantees that it will provide you results. You can only true.</p>
<p>To lose weight you need to burn more calories than you consume. You do exercise and dieting. Keep those things in mind. Don’t let anyone else fool you. Because there’s plenty of people willing to do so.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Let’s take the figure who brought this supplement to light – Dr. Oz. Many have criticized him for promoting substances that don’t work. The reason being is that people pay him an exorbitant amount of money to promote these products on national television.</p>
<p>This is what makes what he says untrustworthy. Keep that in mind. He doesn’t care if the products work because he gets paid either way. Turns out he was right about Garcinia Cambogia anyway. However, at the time he made those claims – there wasn’t sufficient evidence to indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>What’s ironic is that he really is one of the best heart surgeons in the country. People can be corrupted by the littlest of things. Take his information with a grain of salt. Always look at the evidence. Embed that into your head. It is hard work after all, but worth it. It is after all your health at stake.</p>
<p>Garcinia Cambogia might be the right fit for you. Try it out. No matter what, make sure you take a look at a detoxifying and cleansing supplement in <a href="http://www.dctribune.com/2015/12/14/the-future-of-food-grade-diatomaceous-earth-and-silica-supplementation/">diatomaceous earth silica</a>.</p>
