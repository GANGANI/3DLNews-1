<p>THOMAS M. "TOMMY" LOPER, JR.</p>

<p>June 15, 1947-Jan. 25, 2022</p>

<p>Funeral services for Tommy M. "Tommy" Loper, Jr., 74, of Millry, Ala., were conducted on Friday, Jan. 28, 2022 from Lighthouse of Living Faith Church in Millry, with Rev. Ray Odom and Rev. Mark Guy officiating. </p>

<p>Interment followed at Shady Grove Cemetery in Millry.</p>

<p>Born in Repton, Ala., on Sunday, June 15, 1947 to Thomas M. "Red" Loper, Sr., and Marie Strickland Loper, he was a member of Lighthouse of Living Faith Church. He retired from Millry High School, where he worked as an Agriculture Science Teacher for the Washington County Board of Education. Known to so many as "Mr. Tommy" or "TL," he has a profound impact on thousands of children in the Choctaw County and Washington County public school systems for more than 34 years.</p>

<p>His "boys" (and girls), as he lovingly called them, will never forget the impact he made on their lives daily. HIs life lessons (which often seemed to take a lifetime for him to tell) made their ordinary school days extraordinary. HIs tales would spin out for them, and the students loved the diversion from regular lessons. They only thought they were having fun when all the time he was imparting prodding life wisdom to their hungry souls.</p>

<p>Some of his famous lines include "If a turtle is on a post, somebody put it there;" "Some people still haven't learned to spread mayonnaise with a spoon;" "Don't 'huh,' huh your momma and daddy;" "If you ain't happy, get happy;" "All you need is a little TLC (Tommy Loper Care);" and "The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the smart get smarter and the dumb get dumber." Perhaps his most famous quote went something like this: "When your outgo excess your income, your upkeep will be your downfall." There are so many other quotes that could be shared, but time nor space will allow it.</p>

<p>Perhaps his greatest love of teaching could be explained with a handful of dirt. He led seven of his "boys" to State Land Judging Championships, with one Southeastern Championship at the National Competition in Oklahoma. He and his land judging boys placed in the Top 15 in the nation three different times with his 2001, 2006 and 2008 teams. This was accomplishment he was extremely proud to boast about as there are more than 400 national teams each year.</p>

<p>He would walk into a room filled with more than 2,000 people and, as if he were a statesman or famous politician, the landing judging coaches and teams would be standing in line to shake his hand. He was nationally recognized as one of the greatest land judging advocates and coaches to grace the croplands of Alabama, forests of the Deep South, pastures of Oklahoma and homesites across the nation. When the masses recognized him, his head would visibly swell and his face would turn cherry red. He was truly a celebrity in his own right.</p>

<p>There is bond between him and his boys that can never be severed. The stories of his impact will continue for many years to come. He was truly one of the greatest educators given to Milly High School. His impact is legendary; his love for his students is deeper than death.</p>

<p>He died on Tuesday, Jan. 25, 2022 at Wayne General Hospital.</p>

<p>He is survived by his loving and devoted wife of 23 years, Tina Mills "Belle" Loper of Millry; his son, Thomas M. "Reese" Loper III of Millry; and his daughter, Callie Marie Loper of Millry.</p>

<p>He was preceded in death by his parents, Thomas M. "Red" Loper, Sr.; and his mother, Marie Stricklin Loper.</p>

<p>Pallbearers were Gideon Odom, Elliot Brown, Jimmy Waite, Keenan Connell, Scott Butler, Russell Price, John Harris and Art James. Honorary Pallbearers wereCurtis Kirkland, Charles Owen, Teddy Taylor, John Carter, Wesley Dixon, Arlie Kimbrell, Josh Brown and Raiford Brown.</p>
