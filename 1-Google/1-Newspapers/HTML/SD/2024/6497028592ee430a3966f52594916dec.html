<p>Funeral services for Joseph L. &#8220;Joe&#8221; Fott, 82, of Hamill, SD
will be 2 p.m., Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at the Hamill Community Hall in Hamill,
SD with burial in the Hamill Cemetery at Hamill, SD.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Visitation will begin at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, one hour prior to the
funeral, at the Hamill Community Hall in Hamill, SD.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Joseph Leroy &#8220;Joe&#8221; Fott passed away peacefully at home in Hamill
South Dakota on May 17, 2024. </p>



<p>Joe was born on Nov. 26, 1941 to Joseph and Anna (Fortuna) Fott in Winner
South Dakota, joining his siblings brother Lawrence and sister Adeline on the
family farm near Hamill South Dakota.</p>



<p>Joe attended North Fairview grade school near Hamill and high school in
Winner, SD, graduating from high school in 1959.&nbsp; He attended Greer Technical Institute in
Wilmington, Illinois for diesel and construction mechanics after high
school.&nbsp; Joe joined the South Dakota
National Guard and did basic training in Fort Leonard Wood, MO, and served in
the Chamberlain South Dakota Guard 200th Engineer Bridge Company until
discharge in 1970.</p>



<p>Joe and Judith Mae Gordon were married on May 8, 1965 and had two
children, Joseph Wade in 1966 and Joy Michele in 1969.</p>



<p>Joe spent his entire life farming and ranching on the family farm in
Hamill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe said that he had not worked
a day in his life because he enjoyed everything involved with the farm.&nbsp; Joe especially loved anything with an engine
and wheels or tracks, and spent many long days in the seat of a tractor with a
smile on his face and a steady hand on the steering wheel working on the
farm.&nbsp; Joe was happy to share his
knowledge and offer a helping hand to his neighbors and friends.</p>



<p>Joe was a very outgoing and social person, meeting people and making new
friends wherever he went.&nbsp; Joe loved to
take road trips when a good rain would pause the farming, wife Judy would hear
&#8220;how soon can you be ready to leave?&#8221; and had many adventures while
visiting many of the western states he would say &#8220;I wonder what is down
that road?&nbsp; Lets go find out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Joe loved to hunt and started hunting at a young age.&nbsp; Joe and his family shared their love of
hunting and the bounty of the Hamill farm with friends from near and far,
making lifelong friends and lasting memories in the fields and hills.&nbsp; In the late 1970&#8217;s, Joe hosted then South
Dakota governor Bill Janklow for a pheasant hunt on the farm, this hunt was the
start of what became the South Dakota Governor&#8217;s Hunt that Joe and his family
helped to host for 25 years.</p>



<p>Later in life, Joe was not able to continue actively working on the farm
due to physical limitations.&nbsp; He did not
want to retire from the farm, and always wanted to be out monitoring the
equipment, crops and cows, and sharing his experiences and knowledge with
neighbors and daughter Joy who is operating the family farm.</p>



<p>Joe is preceded in death by his parents Joseph Fott and Anna (Fortuna)
Fott, sister Adeline Hight, brother Lawrence as well as his uncle John Fott and
aunt Bessie (Fott) Petr and many aunts and uncle from the Fortuna side of the
family.</p>



<p>Joe is survived by wife Judy (Gordon) Fott, son Joseph Wade and wife Wendy
and children Joseph Stephen and Anna Helena, daughter Joy Michele and spouse
Faye Heinis and Cynthia.</p>



<p>In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Joe&#8217;s name to Hamill
Community Hall or the Tripp County 4H.</p>

<p>Wendell Ray Burtz, 67, of rural Winner went home to be with his Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at the Avera McKennen Hospital
in Sioux Falls. After dealing with heart problems for the past several months,
Wendell suffered a cardiac arrest on May 11 at his regular Saturday morning
Bible study in Winner.</p>



<p>Funeral service will be held on Thursday, May 23, 2024 at 10 a.m.&nbsp; at the First Baptist Church in Winner,
SD.&nbsp; Burial will follow in the Winner
City Cemetery.&nbsp; A visitation will be held
on Wednesday, May 22, 2024 at the First Baptist Church in Winner from 6-7 p.m.
with a prayer service beginning at 7 p.m.</p>



<p>The third child of Raymond and Berniece Burtz of rural Winner, Wendell was
born on July 26, 1956 at the Baptist Hospital of Winner. He attended Greenwood
School and graduated from Winner High School in 1975. After graduation he
worked at various jobs in the Winner area and lived for a short time in
California. He attended Oak Hills Bible Institute in Bemidji, Minn. from
1978-1980.</p>



<p>After that he worked at various jobs, including as a farm hand and an
over-the-road truck driver, and then moved to Rapid City where he worked for
Lien Metals for several years and also at Harvey&#8217;s Lock Shop. While living
there, he became a member of Rimrock Evangelical Free Church.</p>



<p>On Feb. 14, 1987 he married Beth Nordeen in Rapid City and to this union
were born Charles Wendell in 1989 and Kjerstin Lee in 1990.</p>



<p>In 1991 the family moved back to Winner where Wendell worked at the
hospital and was an active member of the Evangelical Free Church of Winner.
During those years he started Black Hills Flavored Honey, adding various fruit
flavorings to pure locally produced South Dakota honey. The product was sold at
gift shops around the region and was even featured at Bear Country at
Disneyland.</p>



<p>In 2001 he started Integrity Locks and would spend the next 23 years of
his career installing Kaba Ilco electronic locks at hotels and other facilities
across the Midwest and beyond. He retired from the lock business in the fall of
2023.</p>



<p>A small engine and auto mechanic since his high school days, Wendell
enjoyed restoring cars and building hot rods and at the time of his death was
working on building a 1932 Chevy Coupe. He was a frequent attendee at car shows
around the region and often attended Back to the 50s in St. Paul, Minn. in
June.</p>



<p>He also had a lifelong fascination with aviation, owned aircraft and had
taken lessons to become a private pilot. He has attended the air show, EAA
AirVenture, in Oskosh, Wisc. almost annually over the past several years.</p>



<p>Wendell was also a builder, and constructed the straw bale house and shop
overlooking the White River in northern Tripp County where he was living at the
time of his passing.</p>



<p>Growing up in a musical family, Wendell was also a lover of music whose
musical tastes ranged from the soft rock of the 1970s and 80s to the Christian
music of Selah, Steven Curtis Chapman and Jamie Slocum.</p>



<p>Over the past 10 years Wendell had grown greatly in his faith and was an
avid student of the Bible, often listening to the Scriptures being read by an
app on his phone. He also had a deep appreciation for the preaching of Pastor
John MacArthur, Ray Comfort and Paul Washer. One of his favorite biblical
themes was &#8220;repentance.&#8221; For the past several years Wendell has been
a member of Central Plains Evangelical Free Church in Chamberlain and was made
an elder of the church in early 2024.</p>



<p>Wendell is survived by his son Charles of Winner; daughter Kjerstin
Nielsen and her husband, Matt of Burlington, Wisc.; step-daughter, Teresa
Nordeen Davis and her husband, Adam of Rosemount, Minn.; one granddaughter,
Emberlee Nielsen; one step-granddaughter, Karli Davis; one step-grandson,
Timothy Davis; brothers Durwin (Gwendy) of Massillon, Ohio and Ronald (Tammy)
of Central City, Neb.; sister Koreen (Dennis) Caldwell of Macomb, Ill. and
numerous nieces, nephews and cousins.

He was preceded in death by
his parents and an unborn infant granddaughter

<p>Bob Pierce, 88, of East Todd Township, passed away on Thursday, April 25,
2024 at his residence. </p>



<p>Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2024 at 10 a.m. at the
Mason Funeral Home in Winner, SD. Burial will follow in the Mount Hope Cemetery
in Valentine, NE. </p>



<p>Bob was born on Aug. 23, 1935 at the Rosebud IHS Hospital in Rosebud, SD.
His father was William Arthur Pierce and his mother was Violet (Walton) Pierce.
Bob and his family first lived in Winner, SD for three years. While living in
Winner, he had two close friends he met each morning on the corner, Mot and Mo.
They would go downtown with their little wagon to pick up beer bottles left on
the sidewalk from the night before. They were so happy to turn them in to get
their spending money!</p>



<p>When Bob was 10 years old, he went to Black Hawk to stay with his maternal
grandmother Mary &#8220;Minnie&#8221; (Eddy) Walton helping her through the
winter doing various chores for her. While there, he developed a friendship
with two boys about his age. Their father ran a sporting goods store in Rapid
City. The three boys would always hitch hike to Rapid City with success. While
there, they would have their favorite places to play and visit. They made sure
they would get back to the Daughenbaugh Rod and Gun Shop for that ride home
before their dad closed up. Sometimes their dad would take them fishing which
all three boys were happy and looked forward to. In the coming spring, Bob was
sad to say goodbye missing his grandma Walton and his two new friends.</p>



<p>Bob would graduate from Mission High School and went on the get a 4-year
degree at Springfield College. After college Bob went on the teach at Viborg
schools and later at Mission schools, he taught Industrial Arts.</p>



<p>Bob&#8217;s father worked for the Cattlemen Association from Texas. Later his
parents moved to the Hidden Timber area and established a ranch there for
several years. Bob would eventually take over for his elderly parents in the
fall of 1959 and he lived there until his death. Bob followed in his father&#8217;s
footsteps falling in love with the Quarter Horses and the draft horse, Suffolk,
originally from England which was used during the war. Bob also raised red
angus cattle which he was very proud of. Bob loved to tell jokes, laugh, a
wonderful singer, and dancer in college.</p>



<p>Bob was a bachelor for many years until he married Sylvia Carol (Van
Allen) Van Volkenburg when he was 70 years.</p>



<p>Bob is preceded in death by his siblings which include William Pierce,
Ernest Pierce, Mavis Pierce, Leah (Pierce) Peed and Carol (Pierce) Schubauer.</p>



<p>Bob is survived by his nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>Karen Leslie Shattuck Hansen, a cherished mother, devoted wife, and beacon
of light in her community, passed away on April 20, 2024 at the age of 84. </p>



<p>She was born on May 1, 1939, south of Gregory, South Dakota, to Dorothy
and Harold Shattuck. Karen was the beloved firstborn of the family, with three
younger siblings, Marvin, Mavis and Carol Beth.</p>



<p>Growing up on the family farm instilled in Karen a deep connection to the
land and a resilient work ethic. She attended and graduated from Gregory High
School in May 1957. After graduating she attended business school in Rapid
City. She later returned to Winner where she worked at the Ford Garage. This is
where she met Lewis &#8220;Louie&#8221; Hansen. On May 9, 1958, Karen married the
love of her life, Louie. Together, they embarked on a journey filled with love,
laughter, and countless cherished memories.</p>



<p>Karen and Louie were blessed with five children: Brenda, Todd, Troy,
Kendra, and Kirsten. Karen&#8217;s devotion to her children and grandchildren was
unparalleled, as she never missed any activities they were involved in,
supporting them wholeheartedly in all their endeavors. Her love extended to her
role as a grandma, or &#8220;Memaw,&#8221; to her seven grandchildren, and later
as a great-grandmother to three.</p>



<p>Karen&#8217;s selflessness and giving nature were evident in every aspect of her
life. She was named Volunteer of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce for her
tireless efforts. Whether offering comfort to those in hospice care or opening
her home to anyone in need, Karen&#8217;s generosity knew no bounds.</p>



<p>An elegant and put-together woman, Karen was known for her impeccable
style and attention to detail, from her perfectly matched shoes to her radiant
smile. She cherished the simple joys of life, especially gathering with friends
for lunch and celebrating the milestones of those she held dear. Karen&#8217;s
thoughtfulness extended to calling the local radio station to ensure the
birthdays and anniversaries of her loved ones were announced, spreading joy to
all who listened. She loved spending her Sunday mornings at the Winner
Methodist Church, where she was a longtime and dedicated member for many years.</p>



<p>Karen&#8217;s legacy of love, kindness, and compassion will continue to inspire
all who knew her.</p>



<p>She is survived by her sister, Carol Beth Winters (Mike), her children
Brenda Brown (Earl), Todd Hansen (Donnette), Kendra Hansen Best (Rex), and
Kirsten Fischer (Chris), along with her grandchildren: Rojanae Williams
(Jonny), Aryan Brown (Ryan Edwards), Aspen Brown, Brogan, Easton, Waverly, and
Renner Best, and great-grandchildren: Lake and Seren Williams and Ayrro Brown.</p>



<p>Karen Leslie Shattuck Hansen will be deeply missed but forever remembered
for her unwavering love, generosity, and the profound impact she had on the
lives of those around her.</p>



<p>A gathering to honor and celebrate Karen&#8217;s life took place at the
Methodist Church on Tuesday, April 23.&nbsp;
Karen&#8217;s funeral service will be held the following day, April 24, at 10
a.m., also at the Methodist Church.</p>



<p>Though she may be gone from our sight, Karen&#8217;s spirit will live on in the
hearts of all who were touched by her love and kindness.</p>

<p>Sara O&#8217;Bryan Bradford, 22, of Colome, SD passed away on Tuesday, April 9,
2024.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Funeral service was held on Monday, April 15, 2024 at 10 a.m. at the
Colome Vets Hall in Colome, SD.&nbsp; Burial
followed in the Colome City Cemetery.&nbsp; A
visitation was held on Sunday, April 14, 2024 at the Colome Vets Hall from 6-7
p.m. with a prayer service&nbsp; at 7 p.m.</p>



<p>Sara Marie O&#8217;Bryan Bradford was born at 1lb 12 oz on Sept. 15, 2001 in
Sioux Falls, SD. She passed away at her home on April 9, 2024. She was baptized
and confirmed at Zion Lutheran Church in Colome. Sara continued to love the
Lord and read her bible and devotions faithfully.</p>



<p>Growing up, Sara spent time on the farm with her Uncle Ferman and Aunt
Sally Harter. Those were special times for her. Sara received a horse from
Julie Ann Farley which she named Star. They developed a very special
relationship as she nursed Star to health and broke him to ride. During her
high school years she developed physical limitations so she took an interest in
photography. Sara especially loved taking pictures of rodeos, landscapes, and
sunsets.&nbsp; When relaxing at home Sara
enjoyed reading books and writing poems.</p>



<p>Some of Sara&#8217;s fondest memories were working with Lisa Forgey at the Feed
Mill. During high school she also worked at the family business, Dan&#8217;s Last
Shot. She graduated from Colome High School in 2020. After graduating she went
to farrier school in Nebraska. She later worked in Mitchell, SD cleaning
apartments, detailing cars, and helping operate a clothing and candy store.
Sara left Mitchell, moving to Gettysburg, SD where she lived when she met the
love of her life, Dylan.</p>



<p>Dylan and Sara were married in Colome on Sept. 2, 2023. They lived for a
time in New Evarts as Dylan worked for Bradford Construction with his dad.
Later they moved to Colome where they both worked at Dan&#8217;s Last Shot. Dylan
started Diamond B Construction in Colome, while Sara was employed at the Winner
Stockman&#8217;s Café at the time of her death. They enjoyed watching movies
together, going on drives through the countryside to the river, going to
rodeos, grabbing ice cream treats and fishing at the river.</p>



<p>Sara battled mental health for many years but was loved and surrounded
faithfully by her family and God. </p>



<p>She is survived by her husband Dylan Bradford, her parents Dan and Heidi
O&#8217;Bryan (Colome SD), brother Kelly O&#8217;Bryan (Ellendale ND), parents-in-law
Clayton and Roxana Bradford (Selby SD),&nbsp;
brothers-in-law Nathan Bradford and Cooper Bradford (Selby SD),
sister-in-law Tomi and Thomas (Bridger and Peyton) Dryer (Selby SD),
grandmothers Marty Bliese (Gettysburg, SD) and Eileen Tobin (Parkston SD),
grandparents-in-law Donald and Kathleen Hauck (Mobridge SD), Robert and Betsy
Bradford (Belen, NM), Yvonne Kohn (Selby SD), special aunt and uncle Sally and
Ferman Harter (Colome SD) along with many aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>



<p>She was preceded in death by grandparents Ralph Tobin, Mick Bliese, Dick
and Mavis O&#8217;Bryan, and grandfather-in-law William Kohn.</p>

<p>Loretta Diez, 60, of Apple Valley MN, passed away on Wednesday, Feb. 14,
2024 in St. Paul MN.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Graveside service will be held on Saturday April 20, 2024 at 2 p.m. at the
Winner City Cemetery.&nbsp; A luncheon will
follow at St. Mary&#8217;s Hall.</p>



<p>It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of our beloved
sister, aunt and friend, Loretta Diez.&nbsp;
Loretta was born in Winner, South Dakota on April 8, 1963 to Rose and
Carl Diez.&nbsp; She was the youngest of six
children.&nbsp; She grew up on the family farm
near Clearfield, SD and spent her first years of school attending Star Prairie
country school one mile from their home.&nbsp;
She graduated from Winner High School in 1981.&nbsp; She then attended the University of South
Dakota where she made lifelong friends.</p>



<p>She enjoyed participating in pageants and was crowned Miss Winner, Miss
USD and Miss State Fair.&nbsp; Sadly, she was
paralyzed in a car accident in May of 1985.&nbsp;
Even after her accident she went on to crown the next Miss State Fair.</p>



<p>In 1985, at the age of 22, Loretta furthered her education pursing a
master’s degree in counseling psychology.&nbsp;
She had a successful career, culminating in building her own leadership
coaching business.&nbsp; She made such a
positive impact on the many who had the honor of knowing her and she leaves
behind a meaningful legacy.</p>



<p>She enjoyed spending time with her family and many friends.&nbsp; She enjoyed the Diez family reunions in the
Black Hills and loved to spoil her nieces and nephews and cuddle with her great
nieces and nephews.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Plays and concerts were among her favorite experiences.&nbsp; Her trips to Rome, Barcelona, Paris, London,
Venice and Florence were special highlights for her.</p>



<p>She left this world appropriately on Valentine&#8217;s Day, Feb. 14, 2024 in the
loving home and in the loving arms of her sister Margo in Saint Paul,
Minn.&nbsp; Even while her body succumbed to
the cancer that ravaged her physically, she remained mentally strong and fought
hard to stay with us.</p>



<p>Loretta is preceded in death by her parents, Carl and Rose Diez, and her
brother Michael.&nbsp; </p>



<p>She is survived by sister Monica (Bob) Muth, sister-in-law June Diez,
sister Margo (Dan) Osadchuk, brother Jack (Starla) Diez, sister Merna (Randy)
Greer and 14 nieces and nephews, 27 great nieces and nephews and her many
friends.</p>

<p>Courtney Paige Brozik,
45, of Winner, SD, returned home to her Heavenly Father on April 14, 2024 after
a courageous battle with cancer.&nbsp; </p>



<p>&nbsp;Funeral service will be held on Saturday,
April 20, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. at the Trinity Lutheran Church in Winner, SD.&nbsp; Burial will follow in the Winner City
Cemetery.&nbsp; A visitation will be held on
Friday, April 19, 2024 at the Trinity Lutheran Church in Winner, SD from 6-7
p.m. with a prayer service beginning at 7 p.m.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>As with life, her
family was by her side endlessly until she began her eternal life. As much as
we mourn the loss of her physical presence, we find comfort in knowing that her
fight is over and she is now in Heaven watching over us, until we meet again.</p>



<p>Courtney was the first
child born on July 29, 1978, to the union of Ron and Judy McCready.&nbsp; Joining her as siblings in this family were
Tyler in 1980 and Zach in 1984.&nbsp; Courtney
was born and raised in Winner, and ultimately returned to Winner to raise her
family.&nbsp;&nbsp; She graduated from Winner High
School in 1996 and pursued her secondary education at South Dakota State
University, where she obtained her bachelor&#8217;s degree in 2000. Courtney later
attended the University of South Dakota and obtained her graduate certificate
in Child &amp; Adult Advocacy Studies in December of 2022.</p>



<p>On Aug. 17, 2002,
Courtney entered into her Godly marriage and lifelong commitment with Jon
Weston Brozik.&nbsp; This loyal and joyful
partnership was blessed with two children, Ellie and Maxton.&nbsp; They lived their entire lives and raised
their family in Winner, South Dakota.</p>



<p>After completing her
schooling, Courtney began a career of service of helping others.&nbsp; Her first opportunity began at the
Chamberlain Academy in Chamberlain, South Dakota.&nbsp; Next, Courtney worked for the South Dakota
Department of Social Services in the Child Protection division.&nbsp; In 2004, she began her career with Southern
Plains Behavioral Health Services in Winner, South Dakota, and was employed in
that capacity until the time of her passing.&nbsp;
Throughout her lifetime and employment, she has positively impacted
countless lives, often times going without notice or recognition.</p>



<p>Courtney is a lifelong
member of the Trinity Lutheran church in Winner, South Dakota.&nbsp; She also served as a board member for the
Tripp County Library and was a member of the Winner Rotary Club and Winner
Quarterback Club.</p>



<p>She was an avid sports
fan of the children in Winner, especially her Lady Warriors and Warriors.&nbsp; She could always be found following and
supporting her children, Ellie and Maxton, in all of their activities.&nbsp; If there happened to be two of the kids&#8217;
activities at the same time, she would follow one, while still following the
other through livestream. They were her pride and joy!</p>



<p>When Courtney wasn&#8217;t
giving herself to the area children, organizations, agencies, or following her
children, she found joy in her own activities.&nbsp;
She loved to scrapbook, collect antiques and refurbish them, and spend
countless hours on the phone with her closest friends.&nbsp; She was a concert enthusiast, always ready to
go, no matter the performer or location.&nbsp;
She cherished her time spent with her closest friends.</p>



<p>Courtney is lovingly
remembered by her husband Jon and their two children Ellie and Maxton
Brozik,&nbsp; parents Ron and Judy McCready
(Winner), Jim and Linda Brozik (Winner), and Marcy Fifield (Pierre).&nbsp; Also surviving are siblings Tyler (Jennifer)
McCready of Sioux Falls, Zach (Kelli) McCready and family of Chamberlain,
brother-in-law Bruce Drapeaux and family of Spearfish, brother-in-law Jody
(Sally) Brozik and family of Winner, and brother-in-law Paul (Courtney) Brozik
and family of Lawrence, Kansas. She is also survived by numerous aunts, uncles
and cousins.&nbsp; She will be missed by her
countless number of friends and acquaintances.</p>



<p>Courtney was preceded
in death by grandparents:&nbsp; Orvin and Mary
McCready, Harold and June Ringstmeyer, Stan and Rose Brozik, Maxine Audiss, and
Velda Kindt.&nbsp; Additionally, preceding in
death was her father-in-Law, Jack Fifield.</p>
