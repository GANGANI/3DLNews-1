        <h1>Against their Will:  The American Eugenics Movement</h1>
					</center>
					
      <div align="left">
        <p>During the  first half of the twentieth century, a new &lsquo;science,&rsquo; eugenics, tried to identify  &ldquo;fit&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; traits in people and track these traits in family trees.  Proponents hoped families could use eugenics to capitalize on their strongest  genes and have &lsquo;better&rsquo; children.&nbsp; However,  eugenics took a negative turn when supporters tried to use it to weed out the  &ldquo;unfit.&rdquo; Eugenists tried to show that conditions such as &ldquo;feebleminded-ness,&rdquo;  alcoholism, promiscuity, homosexuality, and criminality were genetic and could  be passed down from parent to child. Eugenists promoted programs that would rid  society of these conditions. The &lsquo;science&rsquo; behind the eugenics movement was not  science at all and the movement was discredited. <img src="031912-1.jpg" alt="Eugenics tree" width="252" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
        <p>Today, the  eugenics movement is most often associated with Germany&rsquo;s Nazi party and the  Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews and approximately 270,000 Roma were  killed in an attempt to create a pure race. However, beginning in the early  twentieth century and continuing for decades beyond World War II, there existed  an active eugenics movement in the United States. Between 1909 and 1963,  California forcibly sterilized nearly 20,000 people. Between 1929 and 1974, 7,600  people were victims of North Carolina&rsquo;s sterilization program. Nearly 7,400  people were sterilized in Virginia between 1924 and 1979. These were among the  highest sterilization numbers in the country. However, California, North  Carolina, and Virginia leaders were not alone in their attempts to cleanse  their states of the &ldquo;feeble-minded,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mentally deficient.&rdquo; Thirty-two  states had eugenics programs; there were approximately 60,000 victims.</p>
        <p>In January,  2012, the North Carolina Eugenics Compensation Task Force recommended the state  pay $50,000 reparation to each victim. If approved by the legislature, it would  be the first instance of reparation for forced sterilization in the country. Last  week, California&rsquo;s Department of Developmental Services released this statement: &quot;The State of California deeply regrets the harm  caused to victims of involuntary sterilization that occurred through the first  half of the 1900s. This was a sad and painful period in California's history,  one that should never be repeated.&quot; </p>
        <p>This week, you will learn more of the eugenics movement in  America. </p>
<h3><strong>Eugenics in America</strong></h3>
        <p><img src="031912-2.jpg" alt="Eugenics supporters" width="204" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Cold Spring  Laboratory was the epicenter of the American eugenics movement. The movement  ended long ago; however, Cold Spring Laboratory still exists and remains active  in the fields of genetics and molecular biology research. It also hosts two  interactive websites that help us understand the eugenics movement and its  history in America. Begin by examining the <a href="http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/list2.pl">social origins</a> of the movement (the photo album) at the <a href="http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/"><em>Image Archive on  the American Eugenics Movement</em></a>.&nbsp; Consider: How was society changing? What  social problems did America face? How did eugenics address these issues? <br>
          <br>
To understand  what eugenics was, how it influenced American culture and politics, and how and  why it failed, travel to the sister-site, <a href="http://www.dnai.org/e/index.html"><em>Chronicle</em></a>. <a href="http://www.dnai.org/e/index.html"><em>Chronicle</em></a> features four modules: <em>Threat of the Unfit</em>, <em>Trial of Carrie Buck</em>, <em>In the Third Reich</em>, and <em>Living with Eugenics</em>. You will tour  three of these sections. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the early  twentieth century, genetics was a new science. Eugenists tried to apply  Mendel&rsquo;s experiments on peas, and new information about agricultural breeding  to humans. Their hope was to filter out the traits deemed &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; and solve  America&rsquo;s social problems. Learn more about the <em>Threat of the Unfit </em>with host and Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson.  As you explore, think about these questions: Who was &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; and why were they  a threat? Which traits did they hope to strengthen and which did they hope to eradicate?  How did environmental factors play into eugenics? How did eugenics affect  politics and social policy? What were the research flaws of eugenics? <img src="031912-3.jpg" alt="pamphlet" width="299" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
        <p>Be sure to  view <em>fit and unfit matings</em> in the <em>founders</em> chapter and all of the videos  in the remaining three chapters.</p>
        <h3><strong>Buck versus Bell</strong></h3>
        <p>Eugenists  hoped to end a range of social ills from pauperism to alcoholism, and &ldquo;unfit&rdquo;  behaviors such as promiscuity. They saw sterilization as the means to that end.  What was needed was a test case to determine the legal legitimacy of forced  sterilization. Carrie Buck, a seventeen-year-old, became that test case and the  face of American eugenics movement. </p>
        <p>Meet the  people involved in the court case in the <em>players</em> chapter. Be sure to watch all the videos available for Carrie, Emma, and Vivian  Buck, and to read about Irving Whitehead and Harry Laughlin. </p>
        <p><em><img src="031912-4.jpg" alt="Carrie Buck" width="123" height="297" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Buck versus Bell</em> moved through the Virginia court system to the U.S.  Supreme Court. The <em>trial</em> chapter will  familiarize you with the court case. Why did the prosecution claim Carrie  should be sterilized? What evidence was offered in support of sterilization and  what was the decision? Why were orphans, mental patients, and paupers easy  targets for the eugenics movement, and common victims of forced sterilization?</p>
        <p>The  consequences of the verdict reached far beyond one teenage girl. Learn more  about the <em>outcomes</em>. Be sure to watch  all of the videos in this chapter. What were the national consequences of <em>Buck versus Bell</em>?&nbsp; In addition to being a policy issue, the case  of <em>Buck versus Bell</em> was a tangible, personal  tragedy. Read the final chapter, <em>epilogue</em>,  to debunk the evidence against Carrie, and correct the record. Watch all the  video segments in this final chapter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Eugenics Today?</strong></p>
        <p>The goal of  the Human Genome Project was to identify and map the over 20,000 genes found in  the human genome. In 2003 a complete draft of the human genome became  available. This Project revolutionized scientists&rsquo; understanding of our genetic  makeup. One hope is that this information will allow scientists to identify  disease-causing genes and to develop effective cures or treatment options.  Watch an excerpt from NOVA about the <a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/asset/tdc02_vid_hgp/">Human Genome Project</a>. </p>
        <p>What will be  the consequences of this information? How will it affect public policy, health  insurance, human diversity, and personal choices? What would you do if you knew  your unborn child&rsquo;s DNA contained the gene for a chronic illness? Follow Kay  Redfield Jamison as she explains and examines manic depression in Chronicle&rsquo;s  final module, <a href="http://www.dnai.org/e/index.html"><em>Living  with Eugenics</em></a>.  What does she fear the impact will be of future genetic testing on chronic yet  treatable conditions, like manic depression? What do you imagine is the future  of genetic testing and genetic science? Which possibilities would you find  acceptable and unacceptable?</p>

		<h3>Newspaper Activities        </h3>
		<p>Read the news  in the <strong>[TargetNewspaper]</strong>. Consider the  news from a eugenist lens. Select several articles and highlight key phrases. Annotate  in the margins how a eugenics supporter would respond, including what actions  she would suggest. On the other margin, annotate how a eugenics detractor would  respond to her.</p></div>
