        <h1>Into  The Deep: James Cameron reaches Challenger Deep</h1>
					</center>
					
      <div align="left">
        <p><img src="040212-1.jpg" alt="James Cameron in submersible" width="224" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">For centuries, explorers have journeyed to the far reaches of the  human world. Centuries ago, explorers sailed upon the ocean and discovered  lands unknown to them. New generations of pioneers charted those lands,  travelling by foot, by horse, and by buggy. In the 1960s, scientists and  explorers turned their attention skyward. In 1969, Neil Armstrong became the  first person to walk on the moon. Eleven Americans followed in his footsteps.</p>
        <p>But what of Earth&rsquo;s oceans? The global ocean (divided into five  areas: Pacific, Atlantic, Southern, Indian, and Arctic) covers 71% of the  earth&rsquo;s surface. Yet, despite its expanse (or, perhaps because of it), 95% of  the ocean remains unexplored. The ocean presents a final realm for explorers to  dive into. </p>
        <p>The deepest part of the world&rsquo;s ocean is known as the Mariana  Trench. The Trench lies beneath the Pacific Ocean, off the eastern coast of to  the Mariana Islands. (Locate this region on a map.) The Trench is 1,580 miles  long and 43 miles wide. </p>
        <p>On Sunday, March 25, 2012, filmmaker and explorer James Cameron  made the journey to Challenger Deep. Found at the southern end of the Mariana  Trench, Challenger Deep is the deepest known point of the ocean; it lies seven  miles below the water&rsquo;s surface. There is much to explore here. Bathed in  darkness, brutally cold, and under extraordinary pressure, this is not a  welcoming environment. Challenger Deep has been visited by only two other men  in history. Jacque Piccard and Don Walsh traveled to the ocean depths in 1960. <img src="040212-2.jpg" alt="Map of Challenger Deep" width="149" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
        <p>This week, dive into an online exploration of Challenger Deep and  James Cameron&rsquo;s mission to the very bottom of earth&rsquo;s ocean.</p>
        <h3><strong>The Man in the Submersible</strong></h3>
        <p>Ask most people, &ldquo;Who is James Cameron?&rdquo; and the response will  likely include that he is a director. Indeed, Cameron directed Hollywood&rsquo;s  highest grossing films of all time: <em>Titanic</em>,  and <em>Avatar</em>. He is also responsible  for the <em>Terminator</em>, and the <em>Alien</em> series. This may not be who you  would expect to explore the depths of the ocean. James Cameron connects the  dots and explains how his childhood experiences, movies, and explorations intersect  in this <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/james_cameron_before_avatar_a_curious_boy.html">TED  Talk</a>. Here Cameron shares how he began a &ldquo;journey of discovery&rdquo; and how it  has come &ldquo;full circle.&rdquo; How did childhood experiences influence Cameron? What  did Cameron learn from space training and oceanography? Explain how his  experiences came &ldquo;full circle.&rdquo; What is the difference between failure and  fear? Do you agree with Cameron? What messages do you take from Cameron&rsquo;s talk?  What questions do you have for him?</p>
<h3><strong>DeepSea Challenge</strong></h3>
        <p><img src="040212-3.jpg" alt="Marianas Trench" width="248" height="235" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">National Geographic followed Cameron&rsquo;s expedition to Challenger  Deep. Visit their site, <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/"><em>DeepSea Challenge</em></a>, to do the same.  On the homepage, read the introduction. Scroll down to learn more about the  technology and the science behind the mission. </p>
        <p>In 2009, the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-science/marianas-trench-marine-national-monument/">Marianas  Trench Marine National Monument</a> was established by the United States Fish  and Wildlife Service. It extends 61 million acres, and is one of the world&rsquo;s  largest protected marine territories. Explore some features of the Trench.  Then, to appreciate the magnitude of this dive, investigate the size of the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/">Mariana  Trench</a>. What could be learned from a trip to Challenger Deep and why is  that information important? What about this expedition do you find most  interesting?</p>
        <p>Learn more about the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/deepsea-challenge-expedition-risks-dangers/">expedition</a>.  Watch the short video found in the right menu. (It is worth enlarging the  screen.) What are the objectives of the mission? What creatures do you expect  to find at the ocean&rsquo;s deepest point? What risks does Cameron mention? What  other risks do you predict? Read more about the expedition <img src="040212-4.jpg" alt="Earth&#8217;s oceans from space" width="164" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></p>
        <p>What are the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/deepsea-challenge-expedition-risks-dangers/">risks  and dangers</a> associated with this venture? Which danger would concern you  most? Read about the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/">1960 expedition</a>.  What dangers did they face? In what ways is this dive different than that  earlier one?</p>
        <p>James Cameron may be the face of this mission; however, alongside  him stands an international team of scientists. Who else is on this <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-team/">team</a>? What expertise do they  have? What roles do they play? </p>
        <p>The public part of this expedition was the trip down to  Challenger Deep. However, long before that could happen, a submersible had to  be designed, and tested. The <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-sub/">submersible</a>, <em>DeepSea Challenger</em>, was created just  for this expedition. It is the result of years of work. What makes this sub  unique? </p>
        <p>At its heart, DeepSea Challenge is a scientific expedition. See  photographs of deepsea creatures. Read about the unique <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-science/biology/">biology</a> of the  frigid, dark depths of the ocean. Read about the <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-science/geology/">geology</a> of the  Mariana Trench. What might scientists learn from expeditions to Challenger  Deep? Why might this information be helpful to biologists and geologists?</p>
        <p><img src="040212-5.jpg" alt="Angler fish" width="192" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Finally, read the National Geographic <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120326-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-lunar-sub-science/">article</a> about the completed mission. Watch the video; it includes images of Cameron as  he emerges from the submersible, and excerpts from the news conference that  followed the completion of the expedition. </p>
        <p>In addition to being the first solo trip to Challenger Deep, what  makes this expedition noteworthy? Examine a <a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/multimedia/ocean-exploration-timeline/?ar_a=1">timeline  of ocean exploration</a>. How does this timeline help to explain the significance  of this unique mission? What gaps exist in ocean exploration? Why do you think  Challenger Deep has been ignored by explorers for so long? What expeditions  would you recommend in the short-term and long-term?</p>

		<h3>Newspaper Activities        </h3>
						<p>In his talk at TED, Cameron drew connections between his  childhood experiences, his films, and explorations in space and oceans. As you  read the news in <strong>[TargetNewspaper]</strong>, look for  articles that spark connections to future scientific explorations, or  investigations. What are the connections between the article and science, or  between the article and unknown scientific possibilities? What questions do the  articles provoke? What do you imagine someday might be discovered? Why would  these new discoveries be significant?</p>
