        <h1>RMS Titanic: 100 Years Later</h1></center>
     <p><img src="040912-1.jpg" alt="News headline: &quot;Titanic sinks four hours after hitting iceberg; 866 rescued by Carpathia, probably 1250 perish; Ismay safe, Mrs. Astor maybe, noted names missing.&quot;" width="210" height="229" hspace="5" vspace="5"
align="left">For a hundred years, the story of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>&rsquo;s tragic collision with an iceberg has fascinated people on both sides of the Atlantic. The <em>Titanic </em>was built in Belfast, Ireland.&nbsp; In her maiden voyage, the ship left Southhampton, England for New York City on April 10, 1912. It made stops to pick up passengers in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown, Ireland.</p>
     <p>When she turned toward the open sea, 2,224 passengers and 900 crewmen were aboard. The crew included 325 engineers, firemen, and stokers, and 494 hospitality workers, such as bakers and cooks, stewards and dishwashers, gym instructors, musicians, and cleaners. More than 700 crewmen originated from the Southampton area; only 175 returned home.&nbsp;The crew was composed mostly of men,  most of whom were their family&rsquo;s primary bread-winner and this was, it seemed, a fortunate job.</p>
     <p>The maiden voyage of the <em>Titanic</em> was an historic and social event. The rich and famous of America and Europe purchased tickets for a chance to take this high-profile journey. Even so, the majority of the passengers, 709, were booked into third class, not first class. These were not wealthy people out for a leisure trip. Instead, these passengers were on  the voyage to immigrate to the United States. </p>
     <p>The largest ocean liner at the time, the <em>Titanic</em> was thought to be unsinkable. Captain Smith declared he could not &quot;imagine any condition that would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.&quot; And, yet, four days into the journey, six holes in her hull would fill with water within hours and push the renowned ocean liner to the ocean floor.  Suffering from hypothermia in the frigid North Atlantic water, 1,514 perished.</p>
     <p>This week, the <em>Titanic</em> will capture headlines and attention yet again. April 15, 2012 is the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em>. To commemorate this, the 3D version of <em>Titanic</em>, James Cameron&rsquo;s  historical fiction film was released worldwide on April 4, 2012. On April 11, Guernsey&rsquo;s auction house will announce the buyer of the largest single collection of <em>Titanic</em> artifacts. Meanwhile, you can spend your own time discovering what made the ship unique in its era. What was it like on board? Why was the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em> newsworthy? What is being auctioned and under what conditions?</p>
<h3><strong>Virtual Brochure</strong></h3>
      <p>Since <em>Titanic</em> was designed and built in Belfast, Ireland,  it is fitting that the National Museum of Northern Ireland features an extensive online exhibit dedicated to examining the <em>Titanic</em>&rsquo;s creation and collision, as well as memorializing the enormity of the tragedy and the uniqueness of the people who died. The online exhibit shares <a href="http://www.nmni.com/titanic/Home/Titanica/Exhibition/Porthole.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>16 artifacts</strong></a>, beginning with a porthole recovered from the ocean floor. Visit the <a href="http://www.nmni.com/titanic/Home/Photo-Galleries/Titanic.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>photo gallery</strong></a> and view photos of the <em>Titanic</em> leaving Southampton (photo 2), and just prior to her launch (photo 13).&nbsp; View photos of the first class accommodations (photo 14-19).

<p>News of the sunken liner shocked the world. Because the <em>Titanic</em> sank at 2:20 am on April 15, 1912, it was too late to headline the day&rsquo;s newspapers.

        <p>The RMS <em>Titanic</em> was at first a triumph, the largest passenger ship of its time, replete with innovations and lavish features. Many of Europe and the United States&rsquo; wealthiest people flocked to its inaugural voyage; it was the place to be seen. In its final hours, as over 1,500 people perished amid frigid temperatures and an astonishing lack of lifeboats, it became a tragedy of unimaginable scope. It stands as one of history&rsquo;s deadliest maritime disasters.</p>
