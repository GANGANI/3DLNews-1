      <h1 align="CENTER">Secretary of State Powell</h1>

      <p align="LEFT"> <img src="../images/2k1218_1.jpg" width="193" height="216" align="LEFT" alt="Powell and Bush" hspace="10">In 

        the days following the concession of Vice President Al Gore, President-elect 

        George W. Bush and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney got to work planning 

        their new administration. In the next few months, Bush must fill as many 

        as 6,000 jobs, including as many as 1,200 that require Senate confirmation.</p>

      <p align="LEFT">On Saturday, December 16, Bush announced the nomination 

        of retired General Colin Powell as Secretary of State. Powell joined Bush 

        and Cheney in the gymnasium of Crawford High School, a few miles from 

        Bushs remote ranch in central Texas, for the historic announcement. After 

        reciting Powells many military decorations and accomplishments, Bush 

        praised his designated secretary as a great American hero.</p>

      <p align="LEFT">Powell can hardly be called a new face in public service. 

        He served as the twelfth Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Department 

        of Defense, from October 1, 1989 to September 30, 1993, under both President 

        George Bush (the father of President-elect George W. Bush) and President 

        Bill Clinton. In this capacity, he served as the principal military adviser 

        to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security 

        Council. </p>

      <p align="LEFT">This week's online lesson is about the life and accomplishments 

        of Colin Powell, and the duties and responsibilities he will face as the 

        U.S. Secretary of State under the Bush administration.</p>

      <h3 align="LEFT"> Colin Powell Biography</h3>

      <p align="LEFT"><img src="../images/2k1218_2.jpg" width="180" height="207" alt="Powell" hspace="5" align="RIGHT">Start

        first Army commission? What has Powell done since his retirement in 1993?

        in handling the foreign affairs of the federal government. How does the 

        State Department help U.S. citizens and the national economy? What are

      <h3 align="LEFT">Newspaper Activities</h3>

      <p align="LEFT"> Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is often making the 

        news through her involvement in high-level negotiations and meetings with 

        foreign leaders. Browse a current issue of <a

        href="http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/" target="_blank"><b>the Rapid City Journal</b></a> 

        and look for stories involving the Secretary of State, or stories about 

        foreign affairs that the State Department might be involved with in some 

        way. How would you describe America's role in global politics? How might 

        the world be different if the U.S. took no active role in foreign affairs?</p>
