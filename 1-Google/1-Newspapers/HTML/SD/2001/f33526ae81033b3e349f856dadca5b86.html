      <p align=left><img src="../images/021901-0.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="10" width="182" height="148" alt="Presidents Bush and Vincente">On 
        Friday, February 16, 2001, President George W. Bush visited the neighboring 
        country of Mexico to meet with Mexican President Vincente Fox about current 
        and future relations with the U.S. Mexico's history with its northern 
        neighbor includes border disputes, immigration issues, and trade agreements. 
        Mexico has also become a popular vacation destination for American tourists. 
        But Mexico itself is a diverse and sometimes divided nation, which has 
        grown over many years and has seen the rise and fall of many powerful 
        cultures and conquerors. Meanwhile, the varied landscapes and religious 
        roots continue to influence people's way of life throughout the county.</p>
      <p align=left>In this week's lesson, you will travel to Mexico to learn 
        more about its history, culture and people.</p>

      <h3 align=left>The Struggle for Independence and Identity</h3>

        Mexico has developed over time to become a united and independent nation, 
        the people have experienced many struggles. After the arrival of Hernan 
        Cortes from Spain, who came to explore and conquer the area of Mexico, 
        the native people fought for their rights and for their land, not only 
        with Spain, but also with French invaders and the Americans who were working 
        hard to expand their frontiers from the northern Atlantic coast.</p>

      <h3 align=left>Newspaper Activities</h3>
      <p align=left>Even if you live in the most northern part of the U.S., chances 
        are there's some hint of Mexico in your local neighborhood. Browse a current 
        issue of <a 
      href="http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/" 
      target=_blank><b>the Rapid City Journal</b></a> and look for stories about any 
        Mexican-based festivals or cultural activities. You might also find news 
        about migrants from Mexico, such as those who travel to orchards and farms 
        to work during harvest season. Does your town have an identifiable Mexican-American 
        or other type of ethnic community? If so, do they celebrate some of their 
        homeland traditions? How has the flavor of Mexican music influence America's 
        popular music scene?</p>
