        <h1>Land of the Ainu</h1>
      </center>
					
      <div align="left"> 
        <p><img height="163" width="200" src="images/092903-1.jpg" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="Damage on Hokkaido following the earthquake's aftershocks" align="left">Strong 
          aftershocks shook Japan's northern island of Hokkaido early Saturday, 
          September 27, 2003.</p>
        <p>The 6-magnitude aftershock, followed Friday's magnitude-8 quake about 
          60 miles off the island's eastern shore. Japan is an earthquake-prone 
          country due to its geological location and the movements of tectonic 
          plates.</p>
        <p>The island of Hokkaido is not only a land of earthquakes and volcanoes, 
          however. It is also the homeland of an ancient people called the Ainu 
          (pronounced &quot;eye-nu&quot;).</p>
        <p>Although the Ainu have lived in this region for thousands of years, 
          they seem very little like their Asian neighbors in appearance, language, 
          and cultural traditions. In fact, their mix of European and Asian physical 
          traits contrast so sharply from other indigenous peoples of Asia that 
          no one is really sure of their origin.</p>
        <p>For this week's lesson, you'll meet the Ainu people and get a glimpse 
          into their unique culture that's evolved on Hokkaido over the centuries.</p>
        <h3>Spirit of a Northern People</h3>
        <p><img src="images/092903-2.jpg" alt="An Ainu woman during an important spiritual ceremony" width="187" height="279" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Your 
          virtual trip to Hokkaido begins at the Smithsonian's <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/arctic/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Arctic 
          Studies Center</strong></a>, specifically at the exhibit called, <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/arctic/features/ainu/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ainu: 
          Spirit of a Northern People</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>If you have a Flash player installed, then <strong>Enter</strong> the 
          exhibit. This will pop open an interactive window. If you also have 
          speakers hooked up, you'll be able to hear, as well as read, each room's 
          overview. Thumbnails highlighting a room's contents can be clicked on 
          to view text explaining each artifact. Video commentaries, noted with 
          a video icon, offer great explanations of both artifacts and traditions. 
          (If you don't have speakers, you can still read the video transcripts).</p>
        <p>If you don't have Flash installed, browse the exhibit through its <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/arctic/ainu/html/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>plain 
          text version</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>The exhibit provides seven thematic rooms to tour. After experiencing 
          or skipping the site's Introduction, the video overview of <strong>Room 
          1&#8212; Faces of Ainu</strong> will play. After hearing or reading 
          the overview, browse the room's collection.</p>
        <p>What does &quot;ainu&quot; mean? Who were the Jomon and how do they 
          relate to the Ainu? How do the commentators explain the Ainu's origins?</p>
        <p><img src="images/092903-3.jpg" alt="An Ainu man fishing using a traditional technique" width="210" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Move 
          on to the <strong>Next Room</strong>, <strong>A People's Past</strong>, 
          and browse this exhibit room as you did Room 1. </p>
        <p>In what ways did the Ainu influence trade in their region? How do the 
          artifacts, such as the sealskin boots and the twined basket, illustrate 
          their connections to other cultures in the North Pacific? </p>
        <p>What happened in the 18th and 19th centuries that significantly changed 
          how the Ainu lived and interacted with their neighbors? How did those 
          changes affect their cultural traditions?</p>
        <p>Room 3, <strong>A Life Guided by Kamuy</strong>, explains how the natural 
          world influences Ainu life. The overview, for example, says that everything 
          in the natural world represents what to the Ainu? How does this belief 
          shape their art, like the carvings on their knives, as well as the materials 
          they traditionally used for their tools and clothing?</p>
        <p>When you enter Room 4, <strong>Chise: the Ainu House</strong>, you 
          get a sense of how Ainu have traditionally lived. Why was the fireplace 
          an important aspect of the chise?</p>
        <p><strong><img src="images/092903-4.jpg" alt="Ainu performing the salmon ceremony" width="210" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></strong>In 
          the next room, you'll get <strong>A Vital Cultural Look </strong>at 
          the ceremonies of the Ainu. How has the bear ceremony changed in recent 
          years and why? What is the importance and function of prayer sticks?</p>
        <p>In the exhibit's last two rooms, <strong>Rising from Adversity</strong> 
          and <strong>Renewal</strong>, you'll see examples of how the Ainu culture 
          has evolved to interact with the contemporary world yet keep intact 
          their unique identity.</p>
        <p>How did tough economic times affect Ainu traditions? Why was this transition 
          difficult but necessary for their survival as a people?</p>
        <h3>The Animal Spirits</h3>
        <p><strong><img src="images/092903-5.jpg" alt="Japanese cranes on Hokkaido during mating season" width="210" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"></strong>As 
          you've seen, animals played important roles in Ainu life. So to top 
          off your exploration of Ainu culture, stop by NOVA's companion site 
          to the film, <strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/" target="_blank">Island 
          of the Spirits</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>Spend some time reading the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legends.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ainu 
          Legends</strong></a>. Read through all of them, if you have time, from 
          the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legwag.html" target="_blank"><strong>Water-wagtail</strong></a> 
          to the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legouz.html" target="_blank"><strong>Water-ouzel</strong></a>. 
          Or, using the thumbnail gallery, choose a few that you're most interested 
          in, like maybe the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legott.html" target="_blank"><strong>Otter</strong></a>, 
          <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legbea.html" target="_blank"> 
          <strong>Bear</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legowl.html" target="_blank"><strong>Little 
          Horned Owl</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legsal.html" target="_blank"><strong>Salmon</strong></a>, 
          or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/legcra.html" target="_blank"><strong>Crane</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>How does each animal's natural behavior relate to the Ainu's belief 
          or use of that animal? Why do you think such stories were created and 
          have been kept alive through the generations?</p>
        <p>Do you know of any other traditional cultures that believe animals 
          are spiritually important in similar ways? If so, do you think any of 
          those other cultures had contact with the Ainu before the 18th century 
          (which may have influenced the cultures of both peoples), or do you 
          think these cultures developed similar belief systems independently?</p>

        <h3>Newspaper Activities</h3>
        <p>In current issues of <a href="http://www.targetnewspaper.com/" target="_blank"><b>Targetnewspaper</b></a>, 
          look for stories about traditional cultures, whether based in Asia or 
          the Americas. How is that culture's art and apparent belief system different 
          from that of the Ainu? In what ways are the two cultures similar? How 
          do you think the culture highlighted in the news story was influenced 
          by their homeland's geography or ecology? How may it have been influenced 
          by other cultures, like through exploration and trade?</p>
