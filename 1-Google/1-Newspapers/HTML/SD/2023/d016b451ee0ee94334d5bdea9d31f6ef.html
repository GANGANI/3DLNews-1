<p>Established in 1991, ESAP celebrates
outstanding land stewards in the cattle industry. The regional winners will
compete for the national award, which will be presented during NCBA&#8217;s
Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., April 24-27, 2023. The 2022
Environmental Stewardship Award Program Regional Winners are:</p>



<p>Region I: Lamb Farms, Inc., Oakfield, New
York</p>



<p>Region II: Carter Cattle Company, LLC,
Pintlala, Alabama</p>



<p>Region III: Huth Polled Herefords and S&amp;H
Livestock Enterprises, LLC, Oakfield, Wisconsin</p>



<p>Region IV: Parks Ranch, Goliad County,
Texas</p>



<p>Region V: Mannix Brothers Ranch, Helmville,
Montana</p>



<p>Region VI: Fulstone Ranches, Smith, Nevada</p>



<p>Region VII: Jorgensen Land &amp; Cattle
Partnership, Ideal, South Dakota</p>



<p>&#8220;The Jorgensen family depicts all
aspects of the award ideals while working to improve their operation each year
since 1909,&#8221; said Cindy Zenk, coordinator of the South Dakota Soil Health
Coalition. &#8220;The love of cattle and the land, a passion that continues to
be handed down through generations is vividly evident with the fourth
generation now managing the operation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soil and animal health are the primary
drivers for practices implemented at Jorgensen Land &amp; Cattle. Grazing
rotations are developed based on the impacts to soil health, livestock feed
demands, and the wildlife benefit created from good cover and plant diversity.
Rotational grazing has increased grazing efficiency and improved the
productivity of the grassland. The ranch practices diverse crop rotations,
integrates livestock grazing on both grassland and cropland, and adds as few
external inputs to the cropping or pasture systems as possible. In addition to
the cattle operation, Jorgensen grows 12,000 non-irrigated acres of crops every
year using no-till, which has helped improve soil structure and nutrient
efficiency.</p>



<p>&#8220;We strive to learn from Mother Nature
by studying the native prairies,&#8221; said Cody Jorgensen, chief livestock
officer at Jorgensen Land &amp; Cattle. &#8220;Based on what we learn, we develop
cropping rotations that are intended to mimic the ecosystem we live in.&#8221;</p>



<p>ESAP is generously sponsored by companies
and federal agencies who share the cattle industry&#8217;s commitment to caring for
the environment and protecting natural resources. Sponsors including U.S.
Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Corteva
Agriscience, McDonald&#8217;s, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partner with NCBA

<p><strong>By
Dana Hess</strong></p>



<p><strong>For
the S.D. Newspaper Association</strong></p>



<p>PIERRE — Republican legislative leaders are
promising a conservative approach to the various tax cut bills that have been
submitted during this session of the Legislature. Democratic leaders, who for
years have backed a sales tax cut on food, aren’t entirely optimistic about the
fate of this year’s tax cut legislation.</p>



<p>Their comments were made on Thursday, Jan.
26, to a group of editors and publishers in Pierre for Newspaper Day at the
Legislature.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Currently in the Legislature there are four
bills with versions of sales tax cuts as well as a bill to cut property taxes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Most of us would love to do a tax cut,” said
Senate Majority Leader Casey Crabtree, R-Madison. “We’re going to be
conservative and prudent with our decision-making. We don’t want to make a
mistake now.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;House Majority Leader Will Mortenson,
R-Pierre, said Republican lawmakers are faced with a tough choice as they want
to cut taxes, but they also want to be fiscally conservative.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We
don’t make that decision hastily,” Mortenson said. “Fools rush in.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;A
cut of the sales tax on food was a cornerstone of Gov. Kristi Noem’s
re-election campaign. The Republican leaders said they would work with the
governor, but they needed to consider all the tax cut bills.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The
governor has the loudest microphone of everyone in the Capitol,” Mortenson
said.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The
governor may have the biggest microphone, but, according to Democrats, she’s
not putting in the work that’s needed to pass her bill to cut the sales tax on
food.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“She’s using this as a campaign stunt,” said
Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba, D-Sioux Falls, referring to Noem
announcing her support for the sales tax cut on food during her re-election
campaign. “My sense of the Senate is that she doesn’t have the votes.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;There’s a certain amount of education,
cajoling and arm twisting that goes into the passage of legislation. According
to Nesiba, Noem has been missing in action.</p>



<p>“She hasn’t been making the phone calls,
doing the work necessary,” Nesiba said. “She’s often out of state, traveling,
focusing on something else.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Rather than go without any cut in the sales
tax on food, Nesiba said Democrats have offered alternative bills that cut one
penny and two pennies off the tax.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Democrats are leading the way to a compromise
to get this done,” Nesiba said. “We’ll probably help the governor save face.”</p>

<p>Re-built motorcycle headed for elite
auction later this month</p>



<p>Students, faculty, staff and supporters of
Mitchell Technical</p>



<p>College gathered for the Power Sports
Technology students’ pit stop before with their custom-built motorcycle Friday
afternoon.</p>



<p>Since late September, the program’s six
second-year students, along with representatives of Helping with Horsepower, a
Mitchell-area nonprofit providing opportunities for purpose, wellbeing and
growth through projects such as bike rebuilds, worked tirelessly to tear down
and rebuild the 2018 Harley-Davidson Road Glide for the City of Sturgis, who
purchased the bike.</p>



<p>The finished bike is scheduled to go up for
bids on an elite Mecum Auction in Las Vegas, Nev., Jan. 24-28.</p>



<p>“We wanted to be 90 percent done when they
left (for Christmas break), so we were on a pretty tight deadline,” said Laura
Klock, President and Founder of Helping with Horsepower.</p>



<p>In just over three months, the students
“got to be involved all the way from tearing the bike</p>



<p>down, building some custom stuff and
putting it back together,” according to Power Sports Program Director Chris
Degen.</p>



<p>From the very beginning, it was a team
effort.</p>



<p>“Everyone kind of had their own … design
ideas,” Degen recalled. “We sat around and figured out color schemes and what
we wanted the bike to look like and what we were going for,” then transformed
the touring-style Road Glide into a “race-like bagger.”</p>



<p>The cosmetic transformation is apparent at
first glance and brought cheers from the approximately 100 people in attendance
last Friday.</p>



<p>Most obviously, the solid-colored pearl paint was replaced with a white base and racing strips of blue, bronze and black with barely-noticeable monochromatic Sturgis emblems. The solid black factory seat was replaced with a sporty black and white leather seat embroidered in a diamond pattern with the City of Sturgis emblem displayed prominently at the top. Just</p>



<p>below the gas cap, the official coin for
the 2023 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally was inset into the modified gas tank, and
students fabricated a custom shift linkage bearing the Sturgis logo. A majority
of the chrome was replaced with metallic bronze or high-gloss black-painted
pieces.</p>



<p>In homage to the students who invested
their class periods into the build, the motor mount dons a black Mitchell Tech
logo set on a bronze base.</p>



<p>“There are a lot of (subtle) custom parts
that the students got to” add to the bike to commemorate the 83rd Sturgis
Motorcycle Rally, and to honor the involvement of Mitchell</p>



<p>Tech, Helping with Horsepower and the project’s many corporate sponsors, Degen said, adding that the students were able to use some of the skills they’re learning in their welding class on the project.</p>



<p>And the mechanics were overhauled, too.
Degen said the engine horsepower and torque were increased by 50 percent.
Various standard parts were replaced with performance parts to make the bike
race-ready, but it is enough like the original to still be used as a road
rider.</p>



<p>Although the turnaround on the project was
quick for such an expansive project, Klock said the process was “beautiful.”</p>



<p>“These guys were so fast and so responsive. The motor mount – they talked about it, and then one of them was out the door, making it. (They) did a great job. (They) should all be very proud of (themselves),” she said. “They have such a great base from the school and Chris’s instruction. They understand how it all works. … This is the future of power sports standing here.”</p>



<p>The experience was unique for everyone
involved. For students, it was a first custom build.</p>



<p>And, for Degen and Klock, it was the first
project they’ve had that will be sold to a national audience.</p>



<p>“It was awesome to be able to add the
design and marketing concept to the students’ mechanical coursework that
they’re already learning,” she said.</p>



<p>The bike departed Mitchell last Monday
afternoon, with another unveiling pit stop scheduled for Sturgis on Tuesday at
4 p.m. From there, the bike will be Vegas-bound.</p>



<p>The final day of the bike’s time at auction
will be televised Sat., Jan. 28 at mecum.com/tvtimes. The winner of the auction
will purchase the custom motorcycle, an autographed</p>



<p>concept drawing from designer Tex McDorman
and a VIP package to the 83rd Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, to be held this August
in the Black Hills of South Dakota.</p>



<p>“We hope that whomever the purchaser is
really embraces the story” of the Rally and Helpingwith Horsepower.</p>



<p>Proceeds from the auction will benefit “the
Sturgis Rally Endowment Fund, a part of the Black Hills Community Foundation,
to ensure that the Rally tradition of charitable giving endures for the benefit
of future area residents,” according to Sturgis Mayor Mark Carstensen.</p>



<p>Some of the funds raised will be routed to
Helping with Horsepower, a Mitchell-area nonprofit providing opportunities for
purpose, well-being and growth for individuals born or diagnosed with
limitations. The organization’s Bike Rebuild Program is a therapeutic
opportunity for participants to rebuild a motorcycle as they acquire tools to
rebuild their lives.</p>



<p>“It’s a win-win-win,” according to Laura
Klock, creator of the Helping with Horsepower Biken Rebuild Program. “The
students got the project experience, which included extra training byn some of
the sponsors, … (while Helping with Horsepower and the Rally endowment) benefit</p>



<p>from the proceeds (allowing) HWH to
continue to provide opportunities and hands-on programs.”</p>

<p>He was
in private practice from 1975-2007 in Rapid City working corporate, mining and
environmental law.</p>



<p>Truhe
retired in 2008 and moved to Colorado with his wife, Nicki.</p>



<p>Truhe
says the book is a story of racial injustice and is a first person account of
Truhe’s experience as a US Navy JAG lawyer during the Vietnam War. </p>



<p>An
interracial confrontation occurred aboard the ship while it was conducting
bombing runs into north Vietnam. </p>



<p>Truhe
represented several of the 25 black sailors who were unjustly charged with
rioting and assaults. </p>



<p>The book
covers riots and the court martial trails that followed. </p>



<p>Truhe
said his goal in writing the book was to set the record straight because of all
the one sided and erroneous chronicles of the incident.</p>



<p>“I
wanted to write the complete story in a fair and balanced manner,” he said.</p>



<p>He started
writing the book after the special court martials were completed and while
Truhe was serving as a military judge.</p>



<p>He
collected thousands of pages of original source documents: Navy investigation
reports, hundreds of sworn statements and medical records, Congressional
subcommittee hearing testimony, his own case files and interviews with client
witnesses.</p>



<p>Truhe
retained these documents for 50 years (six banker boxes) and again took up
writing the book in January 2021. </p>



<p>In
January 2022 he presented his manuscript to the publisher for editing. Editing
was completed in July and the book came out in October. </p>



<p>Truhe
said his inspiration and goal in writing the book was to set the record
straight because of all the one-sided and erroneous chronicles of the incident.
</p>



<p>Among
the injustices he said were 25 black sailors were charged with rioting and
assaults against white sailors, but no white sailors were charged. </p>



<p>He said
this was a totally one sided investigation. Truhe added Navy officials&nbsp; withheld critical evidence from defense
lawyers. </p>



<p>Photos
and details are in the book’s website, marvtruhe.com</p>



<p>Truhe
was invited to give a book presentation at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md. </p>



<p>The
newspaper in San Diego, Calif., wrote a front page story on the book Nov. 20.</p>



<p>In the
newspaper story, Truhe said there was deep-seeded racism in Navy, an
institution he respected then and respects still. Questions about fairness in
the legal system, an arena where he would do his life’s work. Questions about
integrity and honesty.</p>



<p>That’s
why he kept those five boxes, to look for answers. It’s why he turned what was
inside into a book which offers the most complete picture yet of what happened
on board the aircraft carrier and in the trials that followed.</p>



<p>Writing
the book took Truhe 18 months of 12 hour days, time spent sifting through
documents, remembering details, reliving the story.</p>



<p>“I am
not usually an angry person but I was angry as all this unfolded 50 years ago,”
he said.</p>



<p>In end,
23 Black Kitty Hawk sailors faced court-martials in San Diego, most of them
accused of rioting and assault. Only one white sailor was charged with assault,
three months after the riot. He was acquitted. </p>



<p>Of the
black defendants, seven accepted plea deals admitting to one or more reduced
charges and received minimal sentences such as time-served or&nbsp; fine. Ten were convicted at a trial of one or
more offenses and also received minimal sentences. </p>



<p>Six
others were exonerated. Three had their charges dismissed before trial, two
were acquitted. </p>



<p>Worried
that the book might come across as a “one-sided rant by a disgruntled defense
attorney” Truhe said he took pains to be balanced in the depiction of events.
The 320 page book includes 1,100 footnotes.</p>



<p>The book
can be purchased through Amazon, Barnes&amp;Noble and other locations.</p>



<p>Truhe&nbsp; and his wife live in a retirement community
in Broomfield, Colo. His wife is from Colorado and they were married in 1970
just before he went on active duty. The couple have been married for 52 years.</p>



<p>They
have a son, Eric, his wife, Leigh, both attorneys, live nearby with two
children. </p>

<p> There is
a desperate need for more EMTs across South Dakota.</p>



<p>To help
fill this need an EMT class will be offered online.</p>



<p>Paul
Schueth of the Tripp County ambulance service, said he and others applied for and
received an &nbsp;EMS SAMHSA grant. </p>



<p>With the
help of the University of South Dakota Tripp County received a $200,000 grant.</p>



<p>The 2023
class will start in January and is free for qualified students.</p>



<p>Persons
will be able to take the class on line. The classes will be Tuesday and
Thursday evenings from 6-10 p.m. via interactive video conferencing. The
classes will be taught by USD.</p>



<p>Students
will be required to take skill sessions which will be held on certain Saturdays
in Winner. The weekend Saturday dates are Feb. 18, March 18, April 15 and May
13.</p>



<p>The cost
of registration $850. But the grant funds allow it to be free for students. All
books will also be free.</p>



<p>This
class is also open to high school students who are interested in becoming an
EMT. </p>



<p>“We are
trying to get more EMTs in the western part of the state,” said Schueth. “In
smaller towns it is hard getting people to volunteer,” he said.</p>



<p>Persons
who are interested are encouraged to sign up for this class.&nbsp; They can call Travis Spier at 605 328-6389 or
Paul Schueth in Winner to get more information.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>A flyer
where persons can scan a QR code to register is available from Schueth. </p>



<p>Completing
an EMT course will provide opportunities for individuals seeking to support
their community and assure rural communities have access to emergency services
and medical care when needed. </p>

<p>It was
the game of the year in Class 11B. Two undefeated teams going at it for
bragging rights as the state champion.</p>



<p>Winner
was going for its third consecutive state championship. Elk Point-Jefferson was
making its first appearance in the DakotaDome in a football championship.</p>



<p>Elk
Point-Jefferson spoiled Winner’s quest for a third consecutive title with a
21-14 victory. It also halted Winner’s 34 game win streak.</p>



<p>“We
couldn’t consistently run the ball,” said Winner coach Trent Olson. </p>



<p>The
coach said this is the best team Winner has seen in 11B play.</p>



<p>The
Friday afternoon game in the Dome lived up to all its pre-game hype. </p>



<p>The game
was scoreless in the first quarter.</p>



<p>In the
second quarter, Huskies running back Lucas Hueser broke free from a 48 yard
bust up the middle to put Elk Point-Jefferson deep in Warrior territory. Hueser
would get the ball again on a 4<sup>th</sup> and goal from the one and he
reached the ball over the line to put EPJ on the board first.</p>



<p>Winner
quickly answered as Riley Orel exploded for a 69 yard TD run. But the two point
conversion failed that kept EPJ in the lead 7-6 with 4:29 to play in the half.</p>



<p>Two
minutes later EPJ scored again and took a 14-6 halftime lead.</p>



<p>Karson
Keiser would miss a 27 yard field goal that came up short in the closing
seconds of the half.</p>



<p>Both
offenses started slow to begin the third quarter. Winner went three and out
while EPJ grabbed one first&nbsp; down but
then had to punt.</p>



<p>The
Warriors put together an efficient drive on their next possession, using the
clock and gaining yards into the Huskies side of the field.</p>



<p>On the
first play of the fourth quarter, Blake Volmer hit Ethan Bartels for a 35 yard
touchdown. The two point conversion was good and Winner had tied the game at
14-14.</p>



<p>The
Huskies retook the lead with just under eight minutes to play when Hueser broke
free up the middle for a 31 yards touchdown scamper. The score is now 21-14.</p>



<p>However,
Winner puts together an all or nothing drive that digs deep into Huskies
territory. With a critical fourth down, the Warriors go for it with a pass by
Volmer which is intercepted and seals the victory for EPJ.</p>



<p>Orel led
the Warriors with 111 yards. Aiden Barfuss added 62 yards. </p>



<p>In
passing, Volmer was 5-14 for 66 yards. </p>



<p>For the
nine seniors on the team they have played in four consecutive championship
games in a row and have a 45-2 record.</p>
