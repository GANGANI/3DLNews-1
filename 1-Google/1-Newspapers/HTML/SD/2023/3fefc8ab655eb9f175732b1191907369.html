<p>Marlo Bicek, 83, of
Winner, SD passed away peacefully with his family by his side on Thursday, May
25, 2023 at the Winner Regional Health Care Center in Winner, SD. </p>



<p>Funeral services were
held on Tuesday, May 30, 2023 at 10 a.m. at the First Baptist Church in Winner,
SD. Burial&nbsp; followed in the Winner City
Cemetery. </p>



<p>Marlo was born on
March 3, 1940 to Raymond and Dorothy (Keogh) Bicek where his parents lived
south of Colome.&nbsp; Marlo has always called
himself a simple man which started early on in his life; being raised with no
electricity using kerosene lamps for any lighting needs and a wood stove to
heat the house. He attended the Kansas Flats country school and developed many
lifelong friends during his attendance there. </p>



<p>Marlo made the
decision to serve his country by enlisting in the National Guard. He was a
member of the 730th medical company, based in Winner. Shortly after enlisting
he met the love of his life, Linda Lee Sweetland, at the Little Diner located
on Main Street Winner.&nbsp; After much
persuasion he finally convinced her to go on a date with him.&nbsp; On their third date as they were dancing,
Marlo told Linda that he could dance with her forever and the decision was
made; they were engaged. </p>



<p>A wedding was soon
planned for December of 1961 but plans soon were changed when Marlo was called
up for active duty to Fort Riley, Kan. Marlo and Linda were then married on
Sept. 3, 1961 creating a union, which Marlo had always said was meant to be.
Through this union, four children were born:&nbsp;
Kay Evans (Daniel) of Storm Lake, Iowa, Amy Engel (DeWayne) of Winner,
SD, Todd Bicek (Angie) of Winner, SD and Carol Peterson (Justin) of Winner SD. </p>



<p>Early on in Marlo and
Linda’s marriage, Marlo discovered the second love of his life; being a truck
driver. Lil Smokey (dad’s CB handle) and a lifelong career of logging over 3
million miles began. During his trucking career, Marlo developed the reputation
of being a man who never met anyone who was a stranger. His children and wife
would tell you that they spent many, many long-suffering hours in the back of
the family’s station wagon waiting for their dad/ husband as he visited with
his newfound friends at gas stations and truck stops. </p>



<p>Dad lived a simple
life. He modeled generosity and paying it forward before it was even popular.
Always seeing needs of others and helping in any way that he could, even if he
was struggling to financially meets the needs of his family. He gave of his
resources, money and time whenever he could. </p>



<p>Even though dad worked
countless hours, he always found the time to get into a little bit of mischief,
tell jokes and share many stories that entertained others. He also found
partners to participate in his crazy antics; teaching his grandkids that having
fun was an essential to living a happy life. </p>



<p>Since the passing of
his Dolly (Dad’s name for his beloved Linda), he did his very best to help fill
the void of our missing mom and grandma. Grateful and blessed for the time that
we got to share with him are his children, Kay, Amy, Todd and Carol. Grandchildren
Samantha Bausch (Eric), Kelly Evans (Joni), Ethan Engel, Jesse Engel, Emilee
Engel (Reese), Brandon Bicek (Emily), Austin Bicek, Hannah Peterson (Ian), and
Elijah Peterson (Kayleona). Great grandchildren Hastings and Elodie Bausch,
Jade Evans, Oaklyn Bicek, and Gavin Fury. Sisters Rhea Nye, Donna Daley
(Vinnie), and Doreen Kaiser (Kevin). Preceded in death by his wife Linda,
parents Raymond and Dorothy, siblings Thomas and Lynette and brother-in-law,
LaVerne Nye. </p>

<p>On the
girls side, Keelie Kuil set a new Winner school record in the 200. Her winning

<p>The
Winner girls placed third. </p>



<p>“The
boys had a really good day and it was good to finally have everyone back
running,” said coach Larry Aaker. </p>



<p>“We had
some kids step up and even though we went&nbsp;
for quality races our depth on the boys side definitely helped us.”</p>



<p>Aaker
added: “The girls did well. We went for quality races for them rather than
quantity and so they weren’t set up to win regions. We did have some kids who
were not able to compete in some races because of the smoke in the air that
caused poor air quality. This was unfortunate but at the end of the day their
health was our number one priority,” explained the coach. Smoke from wildfires
in Canada engulfed most of the state on Thursday with very hazy air quality. </p>

<p>Gerald “Red” Hartford,
96, of Winner, SD passed away on Wednesday, May 17, 2023 at Monument Health
Rapid City Hospital in Rapid City, SD.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Funeral service were
held on Tuesday, May 23, 2023 at 11 a.m. at the Winner United Methodist Church
in Winner, SD.&nbsp; Burial followed in the
Rosebud Cemetery in Bonesteel, SD.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Gerald D. (“Red”)
Hartford, loving and caring husband, dedicated father, entrepreneur, builder,
businessman, Marine, and racer ascended to heaven May 17, 2023 at the age of
96.&nbsp; His was a life lived full pursuing
his various interests and realizing his vision through hard work and
perseverance. </p>



<p>&nbsp;He was born April 6, 1927 into a humble
depression-era environment in Ewing, NE to Otto and Addie (Wilson) Hartford,
the third of three children, his older brother Floyd and sister Norma, both
deceased.&nbsp; The family moved to a site
near Bonesteel, SD during his early high school years where he would board in
town during the week.&nbsp; This meant, of
course, that he had access to an automobile at a time when most students did
not.&nbsp; Although thin as a rail, he
excelled at running track while at Bonesteel HS. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Although they knew of each other, he didn’t
get close to the love of his life, Alice Ruth Jons until she had graduated high
school a year before he did.&nbsp; Alice was
attending the State Normal School in Springfield, SD pursuing her teaching
degree, and they met through mutual friends. </p>



<p>Their romance was put on hold for thirteen months while Gerald fulfilled his voluntary enlistment in the Marine Corps at the end of WWII.  Once honorably discharged at age 19, they continued their courtship to the eventual decision to get married.  However, he had promised his mother that he would not marry as a teenager.  Thus, they were wed the day after he turned twenty years old April 6, 1947 at Alice’s parent’s farmhouse (Emil and Lydia Jons) south of Bonesteel. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Gerald was a gifted mechanical wizard, and his
first steady job was with Rozum Ford in Mitchell, SD where they set up
residence.&nbsp; He did side auto/mechanical
work for a number of people from around the Mitchell area, plus built a number
of items for his own enjoyment, one being a V8 powered hydroplane racing
boat.&nbsp; This exposure led to his becoming
involved in the local auto racing scene, first as a co-promoter of the Mitchell
Speedway, then a race car/engine builder, and then a driver.&nbsp; Although there were a couple short periods
where he didn’t race during the summers, his very successful race career in
eastern SD and western MN spanned from the mid-1950’s through 1972, earning
several track championships along the way.&nbsp;
He is also a member of the Huset’s Speedway Hall Of Fame, in Brandon,
SD.</p>



<p>&nbsp;A move in 1966 brought the family to Winner,
SD where he worked as sales manager for Miller Bros. Chevrolet/Oldsmobile for
the next 18 years.&nbsp; In 1976, he and Alice
purchased the rough lumber yard (Hiway Lumber) and set out building it up to a
full-service lumber/hardware/appliance business.&nbsp; He was elected President of the SD
Lumberman’s Association.&nbsp; Also during
this time, he built/started Hiway Hardware in Hill City, SD along with a mini-strip
mall on the same lot.&nbsp; He then built the
building that currently houses Krull’s grocery. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Throughout this period, he built over 30 homes
in the Winner area and served as a city commissioner. </p>



<p>&nbsp;These businesses and buildings were sold over
time, and at age 65 he and Alice started their last enterprise, Hartford
Cabinet Shop, which manufactured commercial and residential cabinets until he
turned 85, when he finally “retired”.&nbsp;
But he kept both a small wood shop and metal shop to keep him busy. </p>



<p>Gerald is survived by his wife of 76 years, Alice, as well as his children Barbara Tracy (Rapid City, SD), Jerry and wife Leslie (San Diego, CA), Lynn Jacobs and husband Pete (Rochester, MN), and Rick and wife Twila (Hickory, NC).  Also, six grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren.</p>



<p>We’ll dearly miss this man of many talents, but just as much, we’ll miss his witty sense of humor, his understated but always present caring, and his strength of character.  There were still many projects he would have liked to initiate and complete.  He just ran out of time.</p>

<p>Agnes Volmer, 98, of
Winner, SD passed away on Sunday, May 14, 2023, at the Winner Regional
Healthcare Facility in Winner, SD.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Mass of Christian
Burial will be held on Thursday, May 25, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. at the St. Isidore
Catholic Church in Colome, SD.&nbsp; Burial
will follow in the Colome City Cemetery.&nbsp;
A rosary will be held one hour prior to the funeral service.</p>



<p>Agnes Julia Volmer was
born on June 27, 1924, at the family farm north of Norden, Neb..&nbsp; She was the youngest of five children born to
John and Catherine (Simons) Keogh.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
attended country school, then continued her education at St. Martins, in
Sturgis SD, and graduated from St. Johns Catholic High School in Omaha, Neb.
When World War II started in 1939, Agnes returned to the family farm to help
her ailing father with the farm because her brothers were drafted into the
army. </p>



<p>On Oct. 30, 1946, she
married Henry F. Volmer to this union one daughter was born.&nbsp; They lived on the Volmer ranch northwest of
Keya Paha and were members of the St. Ann’s Catholic Church.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agnes was a member of the Altar Society, the
local extension club, and the VFW Auxiliary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She always had a big garden, was a fantastic seamstress, crocheted and
knitted.&nbsp; In the early 1970s, she worked
at the Outlaw Trading Post.&nbsp; Then in 1977
they sold the ranch and headed west to Rapid City. She did various jobs and
then took a position at the Rapid City Medical Center as a transcriptionist and
receptionist working there until she retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not long after she retired, Henry was diagnosed with cancer and passed
away in 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of sitting at
home, Agnes began volunteering her time at Rapid City Regional Hospital.&nbsp; Taking care of her house, mowing the yard,
and tending to her flowers and garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 2014, she moved back to Winner to be closer to her family.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Agnes was always very
independent, insisting on doing her own housekeeping, cooking meals, and baking
cookies.&nbsp; She loved to share her food
with others; if you stopped, she would have a cookie for you, and she loved to
take her neighbors’ food.&nbsp; When a new
tenant moved into the building she would welcome them, and make sure if they
needed anything to knock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was also
an avid reader, reading everything from history to cooking and non-fiction
books.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had read so many books that
her daughter had trouble finding books that she had not read.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One of Agnes’ greatest
joys was her grandchildren. When they would come to visit her eyes would
twinkle and her contagious smile would appear, and you just knew something
mischievous was about to happen.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Survived by her
daughter Rosemary King, of Winner SD, 2 granddaughters Phyllis (Tim) Meiners,
of Winner, and Susan (CJ) Munkvold, of Irene SD.&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as five great-grandchildren, Ashley
Meiners, Sioux Falls, Alex Meiners and Aryn Meiners of Winner, James Munkvold
and Jayden Munkvold of Irene, along with numerous nieces and nephews.&nbsp; </p>



<p>She was preceded in
death by her husband Henry, parents John and Catherine Keogh, brothers John and
Robert Keogh, sisters Mary Hughes and Sister Margaret Mary Keogh, sister-in-law
Mary Keogh, Dorothy Keogh, Margaret Williams, brother-in-law Charles Williams
and Joseph Volmer. Nephews Joseph Keogh, Larry Keogh, Ronald Keogh, and Raymond
Keogh</p>

<p>Funeral services for
Irma Jean Smith, 97, were held May 20 at Clausen Funeral Home,Burke with pastor
Gary Jacobsen officiating. </p>



<p>Burial was in
Hillsview Cemetery, Dallas. </p>



<p>Irma Jean Edwards
Smith died on May 15. She was born near Dallas on June 21, 1925, the seventh of
James and Martha (Emme) Edwards’s 11 children.</p>



<p>Irma Jean grew up
during the hard times of the Dirty Thirties. She and her sister Verna Mae lived
in the dormitory while they attended Dallas High School and were the first in
the family to graduate. During WW II, after only a six-week summer training
course, she taught a rural school for two years. </p>



<p>Irma Jean married her
high school sweetheart, Orrin William Smith, on Nov. 5, 1947. Their first home
was a tiny trailer in northwestern South Dakota where Orrin worked for a
construction company and Irma Jean had ample space as she learned to drive.
Their second home was a slightly less tiny trailer house on Orrin’s family farm
north of Dallas, where they welcomed their first two daughters, Karel and Kathleen.
In 1955 they moved to a farm near Dixon, where their third daughter, Laurel,
joined the family. </p>



<p>In 1957, Irma Jean&#8217;s
father died, and the family moved to the Edwards farm north of Dallas. A fourth
daughter, Nancy, completed their family. Irma Jean and Orrin farmed and raised
cattle until they retired in the late 1990’s. In 2007 they moved to Herrick.
Their marriage lasted 69 years, until Orrin’s death in 2016.</p>



<p>Whether in a cramped
trailer or the old family farmhouse, Irma Jean created comfortable, welcoming
homes. She was an artist with fabric, sewing beautifully tailored clothes for
herself and her daughters and creating many lovely quilts. She and Orrin shared
a love of dancing, hunting, and fishing; she was confident and competent on the
dance floor, in the kitchen, at the sewing machine, or behind the wheel of a
grain truck. She compiled several books of family genealogy and history. Irma
Jean was a fierce competitor at Scrabble and kept her sharp wit and sense of
humor until the end of her life.</p>



<p>Irma Jean was preceded
in death by her parents; her siblings and in-laws, Arthur Edwards (in
childhood), Marie and John Stuckers, Howard and Shirley Edwards, Ernest
Edwards, Mabel and Ron MacKenzie, Edna Ernsdorff, Allen Edwards, Carma Edwards,
and Frank Putz; and sons-in-law Wayne Christopherson and Alvis Lisenbee. </p>



<p>She is survived by her
daughters Karel (Robert) Birnie of Salix, IA, Kathleen Christopherson of Rapid
City, SD, Laurel (Ken) Shaffer of Lennox, SD, and Nancy (Jim) Krier of Herrick,
SD; her sisters Verna Mae Buhr of Viroqua, WI, and Verdene (Ralph) Parker of
Gering, NE, brother Alvin Edwards of Kearney, NE; sister-in-law Geneva Putz of
Park Rapids, MN; nine grandchildren: Valerie (Mike) Birnie DeBates, Sara
(Chris) Birnie Allen, Jacqueline (Joe) Birnie Bates, Orrin (Alicia) Johnson,
Ingrid (Jason) Johnson Reuter, Alissa (Jeremy) Shaffer Luden, Amy (Ryan)
Shaffer Penning, Natalie (Fidel) Krier Arreola, and Samuel Krier; eighteen
great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>Staff writer </p>



<p>The summer lunch program in Winner will start on June 5 and run through July 14. No lunches will be served during the 4th and 5th of July. </p>



<p>The lunches are free
to all kids 18 and under in the Winner School District. You do not need to fill
out any paperwork to partake in the lunches and there will be no questions
asked. </p>



<p>Lunches are served in
the Armory Monday-Thursday from noon to&nbsp;
1 p.m. </p>



<p>The program will run
congruent with Summer Rec. This allows for the kids to grab lunch right after
Summer Rec or right before the pool opens. </p>



<p>A few changes to the
program include all lunches having to be eaten inside the armory and no
delivery of lunches. </p>



<p>For more information
on the program contact Laura Root at 605-842-8101 or Melanie Bachmann at
605-842-8106</p>
