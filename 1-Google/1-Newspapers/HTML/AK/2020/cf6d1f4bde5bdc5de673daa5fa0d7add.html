Potts was in town on business and had skipped her evening run to attend this hastily arranged meeting with the governor of Alaska, Bill Walker, and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">As a former village public safety officer sergeant and an <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2017/10/19/afn-notebook-native-vpso-sergeant-talks-of-life-and-values-zinke-promises-trump-will-work-with-alaska-native-tribes/" target=_blank>outspoken voice for justice</a> in Alaska villages, Potts said she knew they might want her help with the election, which was weeks away. She’d had a hard year, <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2018/07/26/vpso-supervisor-charged-with-damaging-parked-car-that-blocked-her-pickup/" target=_blank>charged</a> by troopers with damaging a vehicle in a case that was <a href="http://www.newsminer.com/news/local_news/charges-dismissed-against-vpso-coordinator-over-vehicle-crash/article_8b4305fe-461f-11e9-9fdf-a308fcb43ffc.html">later dismissed</a> but that had placed her law enforcement career in jeopardy. Maybe, she thought, the governor and lieutenant governor planned to offer her a job within state government.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The polished brass doors of the elevator opened and Potts, 41 at the time, stepped onto the seventh floor of the Hotel Captain Cook. She knocked on the door to Room 704.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott answered, alone in the room. He asked her to take a seat and began to talk.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Looking her up and down, Mallott told her about the powerful attraction he had for her and hoped she felt the same. When she rose to leave, he reminded her of the effort he’d put into advocating for her over the years. Potts rejected the advances and left.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The story of what happened in the hotel room has never been publicly told. But within 48 hours, Mallott had resigned as lieutenant governor, and within a week, Walker dropped his campaign for reelection.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott died of a heart attack <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/05/08/former-alaska-lt-gov-byron-mallott-dies-at-age-77/" target=_blank>this May</a>, but variations of the misconduct that ended his career continue to plague state government. Since 2017, five Alaska officials have resigned or abandoned their reelection campaigns after harassment or sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">On Aug. 25, the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica reported that Alaska Attorney General Kevin Clarkson had <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/08/25/alaskas-attorney-general-on-unpaid-leave-after-sending-hundreds-of-uncomfortable-texts-to-a-young-female-colleague/" target=_blank>sent hundreds of text messages</a> including kiss emoji, dinner invitations and other overtures to a younger state employee. Gov. Mike Dunleavy <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2020/08/25/attorney-general-resigns-after-disclosure-of-text-messages/" target=_blank>announced Clarkson’s resignation</a> less than two hours later.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">It was the Clarkson resignation that indirectly led Potts and her family to come forward publicly. Potts said that when she reported Mallott’s misconduct to Alaska Native leaders within minutes of it happening, she sought to remain anonymous. She nearly went public when blog posts stated, incorrectly she said, that Mallott’s victim was not Potts but her then-16-year-old daughter.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I asked to remain anonymous to protect my family, and it ended up that my family got attacked,” Potts said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph"><i>[</i><a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/2020/09/10/why-were-telling-the-story-behind-byron-mallotts-resignation-now/" target=_blank><i>From the editor: Why we’re telling this story now</i></a><i>]</i></p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">She later signed a nondisclosure agreement, as part of a 2019 civil settlement, at the request of Mallott. (Mallott’s family says he respected Potts and voluntarily resigned but disputes that he lured her to the meeting under a false pretense.)</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts said she is coming forward today anyway out of concern for her daughter, who she says has been harassed by people who mistakenly think the daughter was propositioned by Mallott. Potts is sharing her firsthand account in an episode that underscores the intense pressure on victims of sexual harassment to stay silent and the high price of reporting the bad behavior of a powerful man.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Walker and other former officials agreed to be interviewed for this story, describing what they knew and when, and why the public has known so little until now. All expressed sympathy for Mallott’s family, given his recent death, and acknowledged that he can no longer tell his side of the story.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Here is what happened according to Potts, as well as interviews with her daughter and father, Walker, chiefs of staff for both Walker and Mallott, Mallott’s son Anthony and others who watched the resignation unfold.</p><h3 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-1wg79zk-0 hBFuvr"><b>An invitation</b></h3><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Each October, thousands gather for a conference and related events to discuss the most pressing matters facing Alaska Native villages, corporations, nonprofit service providers and 229 federally recognized tribes.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd_sz7iBO2c" target=_blank>a familiar face</a> at the Alaska Federation of Natives convention. A Han Gwich’in dog musher and triathlete who grew up in the village of Eagle, she’d taken the stage at the group’s 2017 convention as a keynote speaker describing personal loss and historical trauma. Potts said she was disliked by some at the state Department of Public Safety for saying Alaska <a href="http://www.newsminer.com/news/afn/safety-officer-discusses-crime-rates-in-rural-alaska/article_2b18824e-982f-11e6-a11f-679c8b0d5933.html" target=_blank>wasn’t doing enough</a> to protect villagers.</p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 block-margin-bottom"><div><div><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sd_sz7iBO2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In 2018, the conference had returned to Anchorage — it sometimes alternates between there and Fairbanks — and Potts was in town early as a member of the governor’s advisory council on tribal relations.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts ran the law enforcement program for the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a Fairbanks-based tribal nonprofit. Her boss at TCC, Victor Joseph, also attended the council meeting on Oct. 14 at the Atwood Building downtown, as did Walker and Mallott.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In a phone interview, Walker said he made an appearance at the beginning of the meeting, sitting next to Potts for about half an hour. Potts, who had been training for an Ironman triathlon, remembers keeping track of the time on her heart monitor watch.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">During a break, Potts stepped out of the conference room. “As I was walking out of the restroom, there was Byron in this narrow hallway,” she said, referring to Mallott, whom she had met years earlier at a Minto village <a href="http://www.newsminer.com/potlatch-celebrations-differ-in-each-region-of-alaska/article_69705e2e-ea7e-11e3-be92-001a4bcf6878.html" target=_blank>potlatch</a> while working as a village public safety officer.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">What was she doing after the meeting, Mallott asked. “He said, ‘The governor and I would like to meet with you.’”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">When the committee adjourned at 3:30 p.m., Potts said she approached Mallott.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I said, ‘I’m available now if you both are,’” she said. “He said yes.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">She had assumed the talk would take place at the Atwood Building, where the tribal advisory group had just met and the governor and lieutenant governor have state offices. Instead, Mallott suggested they go to the Hotel Captain Cook, six blocks away.</p><figure class="article-body-image-container emphasized"><picture class="Image__StyledPicture-sc-8yioqf-0 iKCNis"><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/-N5q3w3xa_AQ9sLQd7owL6_jvD8=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/ZBE5OWK5FZFJLPTCSK5JLN3R2Y.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/MuUcRM-PdC8stlxoSc8MBhz-D_A=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/ZBE5OWK5FZFJLPTCSK5JLN3R2Y.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/DP3uek4OdM7mnxlNMMkYnxlCVLc=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/ZBE5OWK5FZFJLPTCSK5JLN3R2Y.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"/><img src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/-N5q3w3xa_AQ9sLQd7owL6_jvD8=/1440x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/ZBE5OWK5FZFJLPTCSK5JLN3R2Y.jpg" width="1440" height="0" loading="lazy"/></picture><figcaption><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 WzIXV image-metadata"><span>Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott in 2017.  (Bill Roth / ADN) </span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott, then 75, cut a towering figure in Alaska politics. Over a decades-long career, he’d been the mayor of the capital city of Juneau, chief executive for the Sealaska Corp., executive director for the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. and president of the Alaska Federation of Natives. He had been the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014 before <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/article/walker-mallott-join-forces-governors-race/2014/09/02/">joining with Walker</a>, an independent, to defeat Republican incumbent Sean Parnell.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">As lieutenant governor, Mallott still lived in Juneau and had long used the luxury hotel for extended stays and as a second office while in Anchorage, friends said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It did not even occur to me that this was unusual because I knew politicians sometimes have staff rooms at hotels and I trusted him as Lt. Governor and as an elder,” Potts wrote in a statement describing the encounter that was recently provided to the Daily News and ProPublica.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In a phone interview, Walker said he was not invited to the meeting by Mallott and had no idea it was happening.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts said she’d learned to tolerate and ignore sexual harassment, as most of her co-workers were men. Normally, if a man invited her to a hotel, as some have tried over the years, she would say no.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott had never previously attempted to cross any boundaries with her, she said. “No advances before that. Never had any romantic or private moments with Byron. (It) never even crossed my mind.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">There was no indication this was anything other than an audience with Alaska’s top elected officials. Walker, battered by the unpopular decision to reduce Alaskans' annual dividend checks in order to pay for state government, was fighting for reelection against Republican former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy and former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In the three-person race, pollsters assumed Walker and Begich would split votes, leaving Dunleavy as the clear favorite. Begich had <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2018/09/04/under-pressure-to-withdraw-begich-reaffirms-plan-to-stay-in-alaska-governors-race/" target=_blank>resisted calls</a> from some Democrats to drop out of the contest, but with the general election three weeks away, Walker’s team was hopeful Begich might fold and present a united front against Dunleavy.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts didn’t know it, but Mallott was among those in the administration who’d discussed trying to find a place for her in state government, according to Walker. Maybe a job with the Department of Public Safety.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“There was some discussion,” Walker said. “I could see … he was mulling around what can be done or something we could do within the state government that would be helpful to her.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Before heading to the hotel, Potts gathered her meeting notes and talked with Walker’s deputy chief of staff, Grace Jang. Potts mentioned the upcoming meeting with the governor and lieutenant governor.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In a phone interview, Jang remembered being surprised by the remark. She gave a puzzled look, Potts recalled.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">There was no such meeting on the official calendars.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Then before leaving the Atwood Building, Potts caught up with her boss in the lobby of the Atwood. She told him, “Hey Victor, the governor and the lieutenant governor invited me to a meeting right now. I’m headed over there now.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“What’s it about?”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I have no idea.”</p><h3 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-1wg79zk-0 hBFuvr"><b>What happened in the room</b></h3><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">As she walked across the tile floors of the Hotel Captain Cook, her phone pinged with two texts from Mallott.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“Tower 1.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“704.”</p><figure class="article-body-image-container article-body-image-container--mobile-left-float justified"><picture class="Image__StyledPicture-sc-8yioqf-0 iKCNis"><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/x764I_lqcueNblS8ylgQm5JE3Z0=/768x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I5GOLQIMX5GHNJKJVEQXLREJRM.png" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/0c8bnnlDJ_S4gTsQF6kyUOnNyM8=/400x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I5GOLQIMX5GHNJKJVEQXLREJRM.png" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/0c8bnnlDJ_S4gTsQF6kyUOnNyM8=/400x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I5GOLQIMX5GHNJKJVEQXLREJRM.png" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"/><img src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/x764I_lqcueNblS8ylgQm5JE3Z0=/768x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I5GOLQIMX5GHNJKJVEQXLREJRM.png" width="768" height="0" loading="lazy"/></picture><figcaption><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 WzIXV image-metadata"><span>A screenshot of Mallott’s and Potts’ text exchange.

Wally Hickel in 1965, the hotel is one of the few high-rise fence posts of the Anchorage skyline. A statue of its namesake explorer stands in the lobby, near a chart of Cook’s voyages.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts stepped into the wood-and-brass elevator. A bell chimed as it climbed each of the seven floors. At about 3:50 p.m., Potts knocked on the narrow black door of Room 704.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott greeted her alone in the suite, Potts said. A wall separated the office space from his bed around the corner. The vertical windows framed downtown Anchorage; the rippling Alaska state flag and the entryway of a state courthouse were visible on the street below.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts said, “I immediately thought that the governor was running late, but before I even was able to inquire where the governor was, (Mallott) immediately told me to sit down.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">She sat on a chair facing the window; Mallott sat on a small couch.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“Ever since I met you,” Mallott began, according to Potts, “I’ve been physically attracted to you, and I hope that’s reciprocated.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“You don’t have to answer now,” he added.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The blood seemed to leave Potts' legs. She said she felt sick, her heart pounding. She was used to controlling a room as a public safety officer, stopping fights and confronting abusers. She wasn’t used to feeling powerless.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">For a few moments no one spoke.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“In my mind I wanted to cuss him out and tell him that I’m absolutely not interested and remind him that he was an old man,” she said. “But because of his power, I also realized I couldn’t offend or alarm him for fear of repercussions to my career.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">She parried. “I am focused on my work and advocacy,” she said. She made small talk, buying time. She searched for a solution. How to let him down easy. How to exit the room as fast as possible.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I was thinking how to get out of the room without offending or alarming him. I told him that I appreciated what their administration has done and accomplished,” Potts said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Another silence.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“About your comment,” she said. “I’m shocked and I don’t really have anything to say about that.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott responded by talking about how he’d always supported her career, she said. “He talked about how he’s advocated for me and my reputation so that I could continue to have a voice and continue to work,” she noted in a description she wrote soon after the encounter and recently provided to the Daily News and ProPublica.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“As he was telling me everything he had done for me, I definitely felt he was trying to make me feel like I owed him something,” Potts wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“He was looking me up and down,” she wrote. Her legs shook and she sat on her hands to try to steady herself.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The Garmin running watch she wore to monitor her heart while exercising recorded every pounding beat. When Potts later looked at the app, she found her heart rate had spiked around 4 p.m., the time of the encounter.</p><figure class="article-body-image-container article-body-image-container--mobile-left-float justified"><picture class="Image__StyledPicture-sc-8yioqf-0 iKCNis"><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/CBdL_U9yjnvNPvPJRLrfM7y8-Ek=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I6OC4XHT4JEKNOZVDGRMRIWZGE.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/RePl6ChG5uGhbdG9Bn37U2_BZ5U=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I6OC4XHT4JEKNOZVDGRMRIWZGE.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/RePl6ChG5uGhbdG9Bn37U2_BZ5U=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I6OC4XHT4JEKNOZVDGRMRIWZGE.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"/><img src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/CBdL_U9yjnvNPvPJRLrfM7y8-Ek=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/I6OC4XHT4JEKNOZVDGRMRIWZGE.JPG" width="768" height="0" loading="lazy"/></picture><figcaption><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 WzIXV image-metadata"><span>Potts' heart rate monitor spiked at 4 p.m., when she met Mallott in his hotel room.

He continued: ‘About my comment earlier. I’ve been so physically attracted to you but what sane man wouldn’t be? It’s not all just your beauty, it’s your power and strength and your voice. You are a fighter. I like that you’re a fighter. I’m a good man.’ ”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts said he seemed to be making the case for himself. He’d been sober for 25 years, he said, and faithful to his wife.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“But I had to tell you about my feelings for you and how special you are to me,” he said, Potts recalled.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Standing up, she said she really had to leave. Mallott gave her an awkward hug and she walked out the door.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Later, she wrote: “The power dynamic in this situation with the Lt. Governor actually scared me. The amount of power this man held, the deception to get me to his room, the comments he was making, the insinuation that I should submit to him sexually, his effort to manipulate me, his ability to destroy me, all made me feel powerless and fear for my career and livelihood.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Claire Richardson, Mallott’s chief of staff at the time, said that when Mallott later described the encounter to her, he acknowledged telling Potts that he found her powerfully attractive. But he seemed to think it had ended “benignly.”</p><div id="fusion-static-enter:article-html-block-ODESS4C6KNGVROUYGG5TYHTMZU" style="display:none" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-ODESS4C6KNGVROUYGG5TYHTMZU"></div><div class="html__StyledDiv-sc-169xx7v-0 himmas block-margin-bottom"><div class="empty" style="padding: 10px;color:white;text-align:center;font-size:2em;">

I agreed bc I thought it was about work.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">One of the women, Enei Peter, replied: “What the hell happened???!!! Should we conference call??”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts wrote, “Well, after the meeting I told him I was available. He invited me to his room 704, which he’s the LT Gov so I thought it was ok and people would be there. Nope.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“Oh no,” Peter wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts, Peter and another friend, who asked not to be named, spoke with one another in a conference call and Potts described the encounter. Peter said she felt nauseated hearing Potts, known for her strength, in tears.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“This is not OK,” Peter remembers saying to Potts at the time. The friends encouraged her to tell someone.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts said she spoke to Joseph, her boss at Tanana Chiefs Conference. (He did not respond to interview requests for this story.) She told him what Mallott had said and that she never wanted to be around him again.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Joseph suggested that he tell the governor what happened. Potts agreed but said she did not want to come forward publicly.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I wanted to remain anonymous because I feared that I would experience what other women who report often go through, especially in the public eye when confronting a powerful person,” Potts wrote in her original description of what occurred. She also feared Mallott would deny what happened.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Just before 8 p.m. she flew home to her children, including her then-16-year-old daughter, Quannah Chasing Horse Potts, who had remained in Fairbanks.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Her heart kept pounding. A worried friend drove her to the emergency room to get checked out for a rapid heartbeat.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“The doctors gave me medication and monitored me until I was stable and released me after 1 a.m. on (Oct. 15.),” Potts wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">By then it was Monday, the first day of the Elders and Youth Conference, a three-day meeting that precedes the Alaska Federation of Natives convention. Mallott was to be a featured speaker at both events.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">His chief of staff, Richardson, was working at her office on the 17th floor of the Atwood Building, where she briefly saw Mallott that morning. He said nothing of the encounter with Potts.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In her account of what happened, which she shared in response to questions from the Daily News and ProPublica, Richardson wrote she handed him his schedule and the lieutenant governor and governor walked together to the nearby Denaʼina Civic and Convention Center.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph"><a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/187087/events/8393488/videos/181861589" target=_blank>Mallott took the stage</a>, talking about his youth in Southeast Alaska and the importance of elders and youths working together to improve safety, security and respect. Behind the scenes, people were talking about Potts' trip to the hospital.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It was just after 3 pm when the Governor’s Director of Tribal Relations Barbara Blake came into my office, closed the door, sat down across from me with eyes as wide as saucers that word on the floor of the convention was that ‘something’ had happened the night before between the Lt. Governor and the victim,” Richardson wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“We both sat there, stunned and speechless in that surreal moment,” Richardson said. (Blake, who is on the <a href="https://www.sealaska.com/about/" target=_blank>board of directors</a> for Sealaska Corp., the Alaska Native corporation headed by Mallott’s son, declined to comment out of respect for Mallott and his family following his death.)</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Richardson texted Mallott and asked him to come back to his office to meet. Richardson and Blake were sitting, waiting for him when he arrived. Mallott seemed to know why they wanted to talk.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“Where were we with the situation?” he asked, according to Richardson.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I suggested we start by him telling us what had happened,” she said.</p><h3 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-1wg79zk-0 hBFuvr"><b>“My jaw hit the floor”</b></h3><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The version of the story that Mallott told friends and colleagues differs slightly from Potts' account. He told them that he intended to meet with her at a coffee shop at the hotel, but that the shop was closed. He denied deceiving her by claiming the governor would be at the meeting too.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">To Richardson and Blake, he said he had invited Potts to talk with him because, as he described it to his chief of staff, Potts was “having some personal and professional difficulties.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Richardson said she asked why he didn’t meet with Potts in one of the public venues at the hotel. She said he didn’t answer.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“This was the year of #MeToo,” Richardson said. U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, had testified <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?451895-1/professor-blasey-ford-testifies-sexual-assault-allegations-part-1&event=451895&playEvent" target=_blank>weeks earlier</a>. Harvey Weinstein was fighting criminal charges for a pattern of behavior that included hotel room assaults. In Alaska, women were <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2018/10/04/a-second-woman-comes-forward-to-say-she-was-raped-in-nome-without-consequence/" target=_blank>coming forward</a> to say that the Nome Police Department had failed to investigate their reports of rape.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In the previous year, three state lawmakers, all Democrats and all men, had resigned or dropped their reelection bids when it was revealed that women had accused them of harassment, assault or misconduct.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In December 2017, Rep. Dean Westlake, D-Kiana, resigned after <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2017/12/08/seven-aides-at-alaska-capitol-say-legislator-made-unwanted-advances-and-comments/" target=_blank>seven women accused</a> him of unwanted advances and <a href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/content/news/Facing-sexual-harassment-accusations-Alaska-Rep-Dean-Westlake-resigns-from-office-464460853.html" target=_blank>an investigation</a> revealed he fathered a child with a teenage girl. Two months after that, Bethel Democratic Rep.

Also in February 2018, a woman filed a <a href="https://www.juneauempire.com/news/rep-parish-faced-sexual-harassment-complaint/" target=_blank>sexual harassment complaint</a> against Rep. Justin Parish, D-Juneau, who dropped his bid for reelection two months later.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph"><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2018/01/16/legislative-report-validates-harassment-complaints-against-former-alaska-rep-westlake/" target=_blank>Westlake has disputed</a> the conclusions and details of a legislative report that corroborated three women’s complaints that he made unwanted sexual advances. Fansler, through an attorney, denied the allegations against him but later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Parish declined to comment when contacted recently by a reporter but House Speaker Bryce Edgmon <a href="http://akhouse.org/2018/04/25/speaker-edgmon-addresses-media-reports-about-rep-parish/" target=_blank>has said</a> an investigation was closed without a finding of harassment.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">It was in this environment that Mallott, running for reelection, invited Potts to his hotel room.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“When he told us that when she came into the suite and he said, ‘I find you powerfully attractive,’ I think my jaw hit the floor,” Richardson wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott gave his staff few other details. But he acknowledged making Potts uncomfortable.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“He said in hindsight he should have terminated the meeting. Instead, he said he offered her a glass of water,” Richardson wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">With Mallott’s staff now aware, news of the misconduct climbed the chain of command within the governor’s office.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Walker’s chief of staff, Scott Kendall, said he also learned of the meeting that afternoon, Oct. 15, 2018. Two prominent Alaska Native leaders called him.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">One of the callers was Victor Joseph. Kendall declined to name the other.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">But they both told the same story.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“At some point in the discussion, and again it wasn’t relayed to me verbatim, but it clearly crossed the line from a professional meeting to some sort of overture,” Kendall said. “And she very quickly, after it made that turn, she decided to leave.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Particularly distressing, Kendall said, was the detail that Potts started having “heart palpitations” soon after.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Kendall left work early. On the drive home he pulled over and called his wife.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">What do you think needs to happen, she asked, according to Kendall. “I said: ‘Me personally, I don’t make the decision. But he’s got to go.’”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Kendall phoned Walker, who said he was on his way back to Anchorage from the Matanuska Valley and headed straight to a campaign debate at the University of Alaska Anchorage.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Walker said he recalls the brief conversation.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“(Kendall) said: ‘We have a situation. And, you know, Byron met with somebody and it’s uncomfortable,’” Walker said. They agreed to talk after <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/335871530305294/" target=_blank>the debate</a>.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Walker said last week that Mallott told him little about what happened in the hotel room, and he made no attempt to learn the details.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It was described that things were said that made Jody uncomfortable,” Walker said.</p><h3 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-1wg79zk-0 hBFuvr"><b>The resignation</b></h3><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Richardson said she stayed late at work at the Atwood Building and drafted a resignation letter for Mallott, unsure if he wanted to use it. But when he arrived at the office the next morning at about 7, he made a few edits and handed it to Walker.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Anthony Mallott said that no one asked his father to resign, and that he did so voluntarily. Walker agreed.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Asked if he would have asked Mallott to resign if the lieutenant governor had not volunteered to do so, Walker said he doesn’t know.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I’m not sure I would have that right to ask somebody who was elected to office to resign,” he said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Richardson handed the draft resignation letter to one of the governor’s secretaries to put on official state letterhead. “She began to read the letter and burst into tears,” Richardson wrote.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">At 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2018, the governor’s office sent Alaska reporters a news release announcing Mallott had resigned as lieutenant governor “effective immediately.” The commissioner for the state health department, Valerie Davidson, had been sworn in to replace him, becoming the first Alaska Native woman to serve as lieutenant governor.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Mallott’s resignation letter gave no details about his actions.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It is a resignation compelled by inappropriate comments I made that placed a person whom I respect and revere in a position of vulnerability,” it said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Walker and Davidson offered a similarly brief description in a joint statement, saying only that Mallott made “inappropriate comments that do not reflect the sterling level of behavior required in his role as Lieutenant Governor.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“Respect for women and respect for all Alaskans is all of our responsibility,” Davidson said in a news conference that lasted less than two minutes and ended without the officials taking any questions.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Later that night outside an Anchorage event, Walker described Mallott’s actions as “inappropriate overtures.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">No one had publicly said the name of the woman, the nature of the overtures or where the encounter took place.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Jang, Walker’s deputy chief of staff, said she knew the public and the media wanted more information about the resignation. Each question answered would have eroded the anonymity the victim had asked for, she said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It’s the victim’s story to tell,” Jang said. “And she wasn’t ready.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">In this vacuum of information, a false narrative took root, according to Potts.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The day after Mallott’s resignation, a former speechwriter for the Republican governor, Parnell, who lost re-election to Walker, posted a story on her political blog.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Subtitled “A woman’s revenge,” it said that “even an ill-advised remark to a 16-year-old doesn’t normally get a statewide elected official pressured out of office two days later.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">The story, unsourced and with no comment from Potts or Mallott, continued to describe a “lovers quarrel” involving Mallott.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“The young girl’s mother evidently had a close relationship with Mallott, who is 75. Must Read Alaska has learned that Mallott said something to the daughter — and the mother went ballistic,” wrote the blogger, Suzanne Downing. Downing gave no evidence to substantiate the claim.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Downing, reached by phone on Wednesday, said she stood by her reporting. She declined to identify the source of her assertion that Mallott had propositioned a teenager. “I wasn’t in the room,” she said. She would not say whether she spoke to Potts or her daughter to verify the claim.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Quannah Chasing Horse Potts said Mallott never propositioned her and that neither she nor her mother spoke to Downing.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Two days after that, another blogger repeated the unsourced story. That article described the woman involved in the encounter with Mallott with sufficient detail to identify her as Jody Potts.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">That week, the Alaska Federation of Natives convention began in Anchorage. The calendar called for Potts <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/ae5180eeb8bd15ef35cebf021/files/2e1869ba-6747-4d6d-8f52-2c9af4b72a0f/100918_2_AFNConvention_Agenda_JS.pdf" target=_blank>to appear</a> on stage in the morning as the sergeant at arms for the conference.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">She considered skipping the event until her father, Mike Potts, texted his encouragement. Go to AFN, he wrote, you did the right thing and have nothing to be ashamed of.</p><figure class="article-body-image-container article-body-image-container--mobile-left-float justified"><picture class="Image__StyledPicture-sc-8yioqf-0 iKCNis"><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/agHbAMkqHM3Evb1DKAbTui9UO_g=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/CEF4GZ3XXJHAJI35OGHILAH2XI.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 992px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/0MXxdvLIagvdVWMXUhBFGFi1GUM=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/CEF4GZ3XXJHAJI35OGHILAH2XI.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"/><source srcSet="https://www.adn.com/resizer/0MXxdvLIagvdVWMXUhBFGFi1GUM=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/CEF4GZ3XXJHAJI35OGHILAH2XI.JPG" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"/><img src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/agHbAMkqHM3Evb1DKAbTui9UO_g=/768x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/CEF4GZ3XXJHAJI35OGHILAH2XI.JPG" width="768" height="0" loading="lazy"/></picture><figcaption><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 WzIXV image-metadata"><span>Caption: Mike Potts encourages Jody to go to the Alaska Federation of Natives convention.

Fewer than three weeks later, on Nov. 6, Alaska voters elected Dunleavy over Begich.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Jody Potts says that Walker’s staff called her about the rumors at one point before he left office and asked her how she’d like to proceed.

The letter informing her of her July 2019 decertification said she had been dishonest about the incident involving the vehicle, she said. She disputes that finding.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts had discussed telling her story publicly with a Daily News reporter in late 2018 and again in the fall of 2019, but in each case the story stalled when she declined an on-the-record interview.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts and Anthony Mallott, Byron’s son, have since acknowledged the existence of a nondisclosure agreement signed in September 2019 or later but declined to provide a copy.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Anthony Mallott said the agreement had not yet been signed when rumors were first published suggesting that Potts' daughter was the true victim.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“I know that there was nothing to keep anybody from talking for the, for the bulk of the time period.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">He described the nondisclosure agreement and settlement in broad terms.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">“It was not your usual NDA, for any reason, as opposed to it was an agreement not to get into a ‘he said, she said,’” Anthony Mallott said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-yj8q2y-0 bVdumb body-paragraph">Potts at some point provided the Mallott family with her written account of what happened in the room.
