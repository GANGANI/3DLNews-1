        SitNews - Underground bunkers. Food stockpiles. Suicide pacts.</P>
      <p>All of these are coming into play as people interpret the infamous &quot;Mayan calendar&quot; to mean that the world will end on December 21. According to a Reuters survey of 16,000 people in 21 countries, at least 10 percent of the population is genuinely concerned that we'll all be annihilated on that date.</p>
      <p>Yes, one in 10 people are really agitated by all the books, documentaries and bumper stickers (&quot;How's my driving &mdash; as I dodge lava, meteors and stampeding wildlife?&quot;)</p>

        (Let's not forget the Incas and Aztecs who are agitated about missed opportunities &mdash; slapping their foreheads and declaring, &quot;Calendars! And we wasted our promotional money on stupid ink pens!&quot;)</p>
      <p>The diehard true believers, who've immersed themselves in occult tomes and survivalist manuals, inspire me to paraphrase my favorite line from &quot;Monty Python's Life of Brian&quot;: &quot;I know an end-of-the-world scenario when I see one. And I should know &mdash; I've been through a few.&quot;</p>
      <p>Then there are the anxiety-plagued individuals who have overheard and retained just enough to be dangerous. (&quot;Yeah, I remember this guy on this show said something or another about the end of the world and stuff. Something to do with trans fats &mdash; or was it adjustable rate mortgages...?&quot;)</p>
      <p>Thank goodness there are still a few individuals who have remained mercifully oblivious to the whole business. (&quot;2012? Man, I thought it was 1954. No wonder I've been waiting so long for my pipe and slippers.&quot;)</p>
      <p>(Granted, some people are actually EMBRACING the apocalypse. Some of my co-workers are planning to take tequila shots every time someone screams, &quot;Help! That indestructible building is collapsing on me! Aieeeeeee!&quot;)</p>

        It doesn't help when quasi-governmental agencies buy into the hysteria. The United States Postal Service recently petitioned Congress for the authority to raise the price of first-class postage to &quot;a 5-gallon jug of water and a zombie-killing kit.&quot;</p>
      <p>Archaeologists, astrophysicists and other mainstream types have made little headway in dispelling the panic. Perhaps they'll benefit from a recent proclamation from the Vatican: &quot;If a calendar doesn't have puppies, daffodils, classic cars or Norman Rockwell, it's not worth diddly.&quot;</p>
      <p>Some scholars admit that there's a grain of truth behind the far-fetched predictions but say that the &quot;end of the world&quot; is much more narrowly focused than the universal cataclysm usually pictured. Says one expert on the classical Mayan period: &quot;The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar actually says that on December 21 Jeremy Higgenbottom must take an afterschool job and start paying for his own &amp;%$# first car.&quot; (&quot;Nooooooooooo!&quot;)</p>
      <p>Of course not everyone who gives credence to the &quot;2012 phenomenon&quot; interprets the calendar as indicating doomsday. Various New Age types view December 21 as the beginning of a touchy-feely &quot;dawning of the age of Aquarius&quot; sort of transformative spiritual event. Ere long, mankind will join hand in hand to declare something like &quot;Please be kind...remember to rewind.&quot; (Hey, YOU have trouble remembering anniversaries. Cut the Mayas a little slack if a 5125-year calendar cycle is a few decades late.)</p>
      <p>Maybe we should all just ignore the hype, focus on cherishing our loved ones on Christmas, change our fire alarm batteries on New Year's Eve and make sincere resolutions for a bright 2013.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be the end of the world.</p>
