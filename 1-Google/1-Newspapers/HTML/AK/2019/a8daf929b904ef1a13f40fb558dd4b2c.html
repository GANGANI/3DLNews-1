        (SitNews) - From the fish camps of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, to the gillnets of Bristol Bay, to the bear and angler-packed banks of Juneau&rsquo;s Sweetheart Creek, salmon connect people to the land, the water, the seasons, and each other. Those connections create a culture that inspired author Amy Gulick&rsquo;s most recent book, &ldquo;The Salmon Way: An Alaska State of Mind,&rdquo; released on May 1. </P>

              <p>The Salmon Way: An Alaska State of Mind by Amy Gulick explores and celebrates the relationships among people and salmon in Alaska.<br>

      <P>&ldquo;Salmon create a generosity of spirit, and generosity creates relationships,&rdquo; Gulick said. &ldquo;Relationships create community. When you step back you think &lsquo;Wow, how can a mere fish do that?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the gift of salmon &mdash;&nbsp;not just to people, but to the land, the plants, the fish, the trees. They&rsquo;re the gift that keeps on giving.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Salmon Way&rdquo; chronicles Alaskans&rsquo; relationship with salmon through six main sections, each one delving into a different theme: salmon as a gift, salmon as seen through the lens of commercial, sport or subsistence fishing, salmon in Bristol Bay, and the future of salmon. It weaves in profiles of salmon people, Gulick&rsquo;s evolution as a salmon lover and stories of her journeys to fish camps, fishing boats, setnets, smokehouses and salmon-loving homes around Alaska.</P>

      <P>Gulick&rsquo;s first book, &ldquo;Salmon in the Trees: Life in Alaska&rsquo;s Tongass Rain Forest,&rdquo; published in 2010, delved into the relationship between salmon and the Tongass&rsquo; trees. </P>
      <P>For &ldquo;The Salmon Way,&rdquo; she asked almost everyone she spoke with the same question: What do salmon mean to you?</P>
      <P>One woman told her salmon are &ldquo;like breathing,&rdquo; Gulick said. People to whom salmon provide different things &mdash; subsistence, sport, a paycheck &mdash; still answered similarly and in ways that went deep.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If you blindfolded yourself and you listened to everybody&rsquo;s answer, you would have no idea who those people were. You couldn&rsquo;t label any of them. You couldn&rsquo;t put them into a faction,&rdquo; Gulick said. </P>
      <P>That led to one of Gulick&rsquo;s goals with the book: to help Alaskans see that when it comes to salmon, we have more similarities than differences. </P>
      <P>&ldquo;If we want a salmon-filled future,&rdquo; Gulick said, &ldquo;we need to be fighting for the fish and not over the fish.&rdquo; </P>

      <P>Every day in her home state of Washington, Gulick said, she&rsquo;s confronted with what Alaska&rsquo;s future could be. The state has spent and budgeted billions of dollars to restore its once-legendary salmon runs, depleted to less than 10 percent of their historical abundance due to what scientist David Montgomery, author of &ldquo;King of Fish: The Thousand Year Run of Salmon,&rdquo; identifies as the &ldquo;Five H&rsquo;s:&rdquo; loss of habitat, overharvest, hydropower and dams, hatcheries, and people not learning from history. </P>
      <P>Each time she traveled north to Alaska, Gulick said, the plane felt like a time machine. </P>

      <P>&ldquo;When I was flying north, I was hurled back in time to what my home was 200 years ago. And I&rsquo;d just be so grateful,&rdquo; she said. Going south, &ldquo;&hellip; in a way I felt like I was being hurled into the future of what (Alaska) could be if we weren&rsquo;t careful&hellip;. I always say the way that we lose salmon is gradual. We lose it stream by stream, river by river. It&rsquo;s not overnight. It&rsquo;s not apocalyptic. It&rsquo;s a slow process, but in a few generations, they&rsquo;re gone. And then enough time goes by, and we don&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo; </P>

      <P>Soon after a conversation with the late and reknowned Tlingit Ravenstail weaver Teri Rofkar of Sitka, who tells her &ldquo;relationships&rdquo; is a better word to use for mountain goats and the Tongass&rsquo;s trees than &ldquo;resources,&rdquo; Gulick writes, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that salmon are valuable to Alaska, but when viewed in monetary terms, fish become commodities. So what are salmon worth to Alaskans? Throughout my travels I asked everyone I met how he or she values salmon. Not a single person responded with financial figures. Instead, all of the answers spoke to the relationship instead of the resource. The most frequent responses included family, community, culture, well-being, and way of life &mdash;&nbsp;values too precious to reduce to dollars and cents, and senseless to try. The truth worth of salmon to Alaskans? Priceless.&rdquo; </P>
