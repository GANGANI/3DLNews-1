        <p>Cook wrote, &quot; Our prayers for comfort, healing, and support, go out to everyone involved.</p>
        <p>&quot;I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation, on behalf of Metlakatla and all our community, to those who responded to the Taquan Air accident on Monday, May 20. We particularly thank the Metlakatla Volunteer Fire Department, the Metlakatla Police Department, and the many local residents who went out in their boats to assist the rescue and recovery efforts,&quot; wrote Mayor Cook.</p>
        <p>&quot;We are also grateful for the support of the US Coast Guard, who sent a crew from Sitka, and the Guardian Flight crew who came to offer assistance in case a medevac was needed,&quot; wrote Mayor Cook. &quot;We appreciate the providers and staff of Annette Island Service Unit, who did all that was possible to resuscitate the victims of this terrible accident.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Metlakatla Police Chief Bruce R. Janes also released a public statement Tuesday, May 21st saying the Metlakatla Police Department was advised of a possible downed floatplane in the area of Port Chester near Metlakatla.</p>
        <p>In the statement, Police Chief Janes identified fatalities as the  pilot Ron Rash age 51 of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and the single passenger as Sarah Luna age 31 of Anchorage, Alaska. The families were notified prior to the release of the names.</p>
        <p>According to Chief Janes, Metlakatla Police arrived on scene and immediately dispatched the Metlakatla Volunteer Fire Department Search and Rescue team, Emergency Medial Service crew and the Metlakatla Fish &amp; Wildlife vessel to the scene. Officers reported there were good Samaritan on-scene and the plane was upside down in the water with an unknown number of occupants onboard.</p>
        <p>MVFD Medivac Response vessel &quot;Triton&quot; arrived on scene at 4:05 PM. F?V Lady Live, a 58 foot commercial seiner, had secured the plane along side and four good Samaritans were in the water trying to free the occupants. The Triton dropped off 6 MVFD volunteers to assist and later learned there were two individuals inside the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad and the United States Coast Guard assets were dispatched immediately to assist.</p>
        <p>According to Chief Janes, at approximately 4:15 PM responders freed the first passenger and EMS transferred the unresponsive patient to Annette Island Service Unit.</p>
        <p>During that time the larger response vessel manage to manipulate the plane into position to free the pilot. EMS then transferred the unresponsive individual to Annette Island Service Unit.</p>
        <p>The plane was then towed into shallow waters near Village Point where many community members assisted in securing the plane and made it available to investigators.</p>
        <p>The investigation  by the National Transportation Safety Board is ongoing.</p>
