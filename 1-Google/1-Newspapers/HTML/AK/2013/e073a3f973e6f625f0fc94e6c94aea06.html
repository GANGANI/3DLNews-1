      Tuesday AM</P>
      <P><BR>
Ketchikan, Alaska - Much of the significant news in 2012 revolved around Alaska Ship and Drydock, one of the community&#8217;s largest employers.</P>
      <P>Early in the year, ASD announced that it had received a large contract from the Alaska Longline Company to build an 136-foot longliner to be delivered in 2013. The news was hailed as an example of ASD&#8217;s future as a major player in the private sector shipbuilding that is expected to boom as development expands in the Arctic.</P>
      <P>Then the State of Alaska, long ASD&#8217;s biggest patron, announced that it was negotiating with the shipyard to the finish the design on the much anticipated first Alaska Class Ferry, a 350-foot, $120 million replacement for the aging ferry system mainliners. This was good news because a role in the final design meant that ASD would have a leg up in the competition to build at least three of the Alaska Class ferries over the next decade meaning the potential of hundreds of millions of dollars being pumped into the local economy.</P>
      <P align="center"><br>

      <P><br>
        In 2012, ASD also completed a $31 million ship assembly hall which is now the tallest building in Ketchikan at just under 110 feet.</P>
      <P>Then there was a real shocker, when ASD announced it was being sold to Vigor Industrial, the largest shipyard company in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor, which had earlier absorbed industry leader Todd Shipyards, met several times with community leaders and the state officials to discuss the sale. </P>
      <P>Company officials assured all concerned that it would build the Alaska Class ferries in Ketchikan if awarded the final contract by the state. The deal was completed and Vigor became the owner of ASD. Vigor employee Adam Beck, a former employee of ASD, was brought in as President of ASD, while former ASD owner Randy Johnson stayed on as vice president.</P>
      <P>But that was just a prelude to the final surprise involving the shipyard in 2012.</P>
      <P>In December, with no advance warning, Governor Sean Parnell announced he was &#8220;downsizing&#8221; the Alaska Class Ferry project because of cost concerns. Parnell told Ketchikan officials that he had determined that the cost of the first ship was going be at least $30 million above the budgeted $120 million cost and that the state needed to refocus its efforts to a way to get more bang for the state&#8217;s buck.</P>
      <P>Parnell announced that he had instructed the state Department of Transportation to scrap the past four years of design work on the Alaska Class ferry and come up with a new design for smaller vessels that would allow the state to build two ferries for the $120 million already approved by the state Legislature.</P>
      <P>Parnell said that he hoped the new design would be finished within one calendar year and that he continued to support the idea of building the new ferries in Alaska.</P>
      <P>Response to the new direction of the Alaska Class project was muted in some Southeast communities such as Ketchikan and Wrangell and openly angry in others, such as Haines and Petersburg. Meetings were scheduled for January, 2013 to discuss the changes.</P>
      <P>Other local news in 2012 was a bit more predictable.</P>
      <P>Ketchikan&#8217;s first newborn of 2012, Kyle Izaac Walker Jasinski ,was born at 3:13 p.m. Jan. 1 at Ketchikan Medical Center, weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces.</P>

      <P>The future scope of Ketchikan&#8217;s legislative district seesawed back and forth in May. First, the state Redistricting Board announced that Ketchikan, Wrangell and North Prince of Wales Island would be in the same State House district. Then the State Supreme Court ordered the board to redraw the SE districts. The Board then created a district that included Ketchikan, Metlakatla and most of the &nbsp;Prince of Wales Island.</P>
      <P>Then the Supreme Court changed its mind and ordered the Board to leave the District constituting Ketchikan, Wrangell and northern POW, at least until 2014.
