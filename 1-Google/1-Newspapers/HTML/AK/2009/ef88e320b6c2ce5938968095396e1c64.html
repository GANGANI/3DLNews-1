      Anchorage, Alaska - A specially painted Alaska Airlines jet adorned
      with a Sitka high school student's winning design touched down
      in Sitka, Alaska, Thursday morning, to celebrate 50 years of
      Alaska statehood. The unique livery on a Boeing 737-400 aircraft
      dubbed the &quot;Spirit of Alaska Statehood&quot; was created
      by 16-year-old Hannah Hamberg. It features a musher and sled
      dog, state ferry, Native Alaskan canoe, bear and whale, along
      with the statement, &quot;We're all pulling together.&quot; </FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hamberg's design was selected
      from among thousands of submissions by students across Alaska
      in a statewide &quot;Paint the Plane&quot; contest. Judged by
      a panel of Alaskan artists and other dignitaries, the design
      will fly throughout Alaska Airlines' network of 59 cities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;This was an amazing opportunity
      to share Alaska's unique heritage with people throughout the
      state and across the country,&quot; said Hamberg. &quot;Growing
      up in a small town in Alaska, I've seen how Alaskans work together
      and help each other. This artwork is a tribute to our ancestors
      who helped shape Alaska over the past 50 years.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Flying from Seattle in the
      special aircraft were Hamberg and her parents, Barth and Mary
      Alice Hamberg of Sitka, Alaska State Representative Peggy Wilson
      and Alaska Airlines representatives. The plane and honored guests
      were welcomed to Hamberg's hometown by Sitka High School students
      and community members.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;What better way to celebrate
      the first 50 years of statehood than to commemorate with a flying
      mural inspired by our state's future - our children,&quot; Governor
      Sarah Palin said. &quot;Hannah's artwork summarizes the values
      and qualities that are uniquely Alaskan and will be cherished
      for generations to come.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Following the welcoming ceremony
      in Sitka, the aircraft will depart for Anchorage and other Alaska
      cities. The plane will be routed throughout Alaska and the West
      Coast to celebrate the unique role air travel plays in the everyday
      lives of Alaskans.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The 'Spirit of Alaska
      Statehood' aircraft symbolizes 50 years of independence and fortitude,&quot;
      said Bill MacKay, Alaska Airlines' senior vice president for
      the state of Alaska. &quot;This unique plane will showcase our
      state's proud heritage everywhere it flies and have a very special
      place in our hearts for years to come.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The aircraft received its new
      livery at Aviation Technical Services of Everett, Wash., where
      48 Associated Painters spent 14 days completing the complicated
      painting process requiring 21 colors and about 160 gallons of
      paint.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hamberg and 12 other finalists
      received a trip to Disneyland Resort for their submissions. In
      all, 13 trips for four to Disneyland Resort were awarded, which
      included round-trip airfare, hotel accommodations and park tickets.</FONT></P>
