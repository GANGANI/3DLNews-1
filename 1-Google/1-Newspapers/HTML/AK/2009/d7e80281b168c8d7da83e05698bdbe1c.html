      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Un-American, disruptive, distorters of truth, manufactured outrage,
      Astroturf, hired guns, and Nazis are all terms used by President
      Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their liberal allies to disparage those
      who are speaking out at healthcare town hall meetings.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Rather than address the legitimate
      questions being raised about Obamacare, the power elite have
      chosen to attack with personal insults. This is a failed strategy
      and it runs the risk of creating serious, long-term alienation
      in the aggrieved victims.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">What a difference six months
      can make. In February, according to the Rasmussen Reports daily
      Presidential Tracking Poll, Obama enjoyed the approval of 65
      percent of Americans. Now after his bruising attacks on these
      activists, his approval rating has slumped to below 50 percent.
      Alienation is a two-way street. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Obama has not been helped by
      his allies. The speaker of the House actually wrote an op-ed
      in USA Today attacking people who voice their displeasure with
      Obama's healthcare reform bill. &quot;These disruptions are occurring
      because opponents are afraid not just of differing views -- but
      of the facts themselves. Drowning out opposing views is simply
      un-American.&quot; What Pelosi fails to realize is that her side
      is the power elite in control of the process and she is the one
      &quot;drowning out opposing views.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Democrats are rushing Obamacare
      through without taking time to listen. Americans expect elected
      officials at every level to give them a voice in the process.
      When those in power force their agenda down the throats of the
      people, resistance is natural. Listen to these town-hall speakers;
      they are frustrated by the arrogance.</FONT></P>

      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No person or organization could
      pay to create an outpouring like America has experienced. Average
      American citizens are standing against this healthcare bill.
      These protests, as the tea party protests before them, are organically
      organized and coordinated by individuals who want their voices
      to be heard, community by community.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">America is proud of patriots
      like Mike Sola, the man who wheeled his son with cerebral palsy
      up to challenge Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. America is proud of
      the man who got roughed up by thugs from the Pipefitters Union
      at the town hall of Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla. We are proud of
      Kenneth Gladney, the black man beaten up by SEIU members in Missouri;
      and Dr. Brian Hill, the urologist from Georgia who would not
      be silenced. The examples are too numerous of Americans doing
      their patriotic duty and participating in the democratic process.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They remind us of other dissenters
      throughout history -- Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, Harriet Tubman,
      William Lloyd Garrison, Carrie Nation, Susan B. Anthony, Rosa
      Parks, and Martin Luther King, Jr. To say protests are un-American
      is to demonstrate limited knowledge of America's grand history
      of protest. </FONT></P>

      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The most desperate attempt
      by those in power is charging that these protestors are an out-of-control
      mob. Watch the video; grandma and grandpa may be agitated, but
      they don't constitute a mob.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The irony in this discussion
      of grassroots activism and Astroturf is that when the liberals
      toss this charge around it is the pot calling the kettle black.
      A simple search of online help-wanted Web sites shows hundreds
      of jobs available as community organizers or Obamacare campaign
      activists. These left-wing activist organizations have received
      billions of dollars from George Soros alone. In stark contrast,
      the opponents of Obamacare are primarily organic and powered
      by volunteers who actually have real jobs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">America is indeed a nation
      of laws, but we as Americans have a moral obligation to speak
      out when our leaders are pushing costly and unconstitutional
      legislation. Obama and his allies are setting themselves up for
      future failure if they ignore the voices of their constituents
      and the will of the American people.</FONT></P>
