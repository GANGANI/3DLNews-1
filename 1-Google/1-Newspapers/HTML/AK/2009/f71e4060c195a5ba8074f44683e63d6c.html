      As the nation seems to be marching inexorably toward universal
      health care, did you ever wonder why medical costs have grown
      beyond all other goods and services? Why is it that this nation
      ranks only 20th in the quality of its care despite those 12 percent
      annual increases that have been routine since the advent of Medicare?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Obviously, there are no simple
      answers. Some experts blame the high cost of new technology,
      others charge the insurance companies and still more blame the
      doctors and more specifically the hospitals and the pharmaceutical
      manufacturers and the consumers themselves. The government (namely
      Congress) has played a major role. Actually, all must share the
      responsibility for a system that seems utterly immune to meaningful
      cost control let alone reduction. It is an enormously complex
      problem. </FONT></P>

      But Barack Obama has a plan to make things better. He wants to
      budget $632 billion to making sure all Americans have the best
      medicine in the world at a reasonable price, including those
      without insurance who currently must use the country's expensive
      emergency rooms as their only physician. He has enlisted all
      the often-warring segments of the industry to help in an effort
      that realistically could cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Whatever the solution, one
      need only experience the bureaucratic horror of a medical emergency
      to understand at least a small part of the reason for the runaway
      growth of expenses. In this case a persistent splitting headache
      resulted in 14 hours of needless redundancy with a price tag
      attached to every one. Hospitals have turned the old Army &quot;hurry
      up and wait&quot; culture into an art form which some cost accountant
      with a green eyeshade breaks down and allocates to a fare-thee-well,
      ready to pass on the resulting costs to an insurance company.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The nightmare began at 2 p.m.
      when a CT scan revealed a growth in the skull that was causing
      a fluid build-up. The symptom was a debilitating headache, dizziness
      and nausea. About 18 hours later the patient finally was admitted
      to a permanent room to await further tests and a biopsy. Throughout
      much of the time, the pain was so excruciating that even a powerful
      narcotic could alleviate it only partially. </FONT></P>

      In between the tentative diagnosis of her problem and her admission
      to the hospital after two ER visits, she was seen by a dozen
      men and women with stethoscopes who asked essentially the same
      questions and ran her through the same manual tests. After each
      one, &quot;I'll be right back,&quot; became the only distraction
      from her fear as her husband began taking bets on the interval.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When the summoned neurosurgeon
      finally made it three hours after treating an emergency elsewhere,
      he apologized for his delay and promised to get her settled and
      some relief quickly. Because of the location of the hospital,
      he decided to send her to another that was closer to her house
      and those of her support group -- parents, etc. He promised to
      clear the way but when she arrived at the second hospital, rather
      than a &quot;direct admit,&quot; she was told she would have
      to go through that facility's ER and be re-evaluated. That, of
      course, meant more of the same questions and manual tests.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally a strongly worded telephone
      call at 3 a. m. to her primary physician resulted in a speeding
      up of the process. In the meantime she waited first in a chair,
      then on a gurney in the hallway and then in another room in the
      ER for more than an hour. By 4 a. m., three quarters of day after
      her agony began she was in a permanent room.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The cost of this hasn't been
      determined. But there is certain to be a charge for each step.
      The needless repetition and bureaucratic bumbling, despite triage
      designed to get quick help for the most urgent cases, is not
      only expensive it is probably endemic to any system, especially
      one run by the notoriously inefficient government. Check out
      Canada if you question that.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Meanwhile, all one can really
      say is good luck, Obama, in finding an antidote no one else has
      discovered.</FONT></P>
