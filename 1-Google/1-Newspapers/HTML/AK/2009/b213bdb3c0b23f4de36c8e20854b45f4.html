      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">August 13, 2009<BR>
      Thursday</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      WASHINGTON - Americans at county fairs are friendly and nice.
      Americans at family reunions are fabulous. Americans at town-hall
      meetings? Not so great.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">August being the month for
      all three, we are seeing a particularly dark side of ourselves
      this month.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Many Americans are in a rage
      over the possibility of changing the health-care-insurance system,
      although our current system has left 47 million Americans out
      of the picture and has denied coverage to millions of others
      even if they have insurance.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Americans are flocking to town-hall
      meetings, screaming and shouting down nonplussed legislators,
      brandishing guns and throwing around false rumors as if they
      were hand grenades. </FONT></P>

      What's up, people? Do we really like the fact that the insurance
      companies are controlling lives, health and destinies because
      these companies have been left on their own to devise complicated,
      costly policies and practices?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Do we not want to make the
      best of this brief window of opportunity to make changes aimed
      at benefiting millions, bringing down costs and helping small
      businesses?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Are we going to get distracted
      by going off on ridiculous tangents, such as believing (falsely)
      that Congress would have the government create &quot;death panels&quot;
      to do in Granny?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Are we going to stand for death
      threats against lawmakers who for a change are trying to work
      together?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Apparently, the answers are
      yes, no, yes and yes. Because of the concerted efforts of some
      radio-talk-show hosts who need to gin up their ratings and some
      Republicans who need an issue for fall elections, we may be on
      the verge of giving insurance companies new government subsidies,
      failing to help Americans who can't afford health care or are
      going bankrupt because of medical bills, believing poppycock
      and not even getting upset at threats of violence against innocent
      people. </FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Death Panels<BR>
      By John Darkow, Columbia Daily Tribune, Missouri<BR>
      Distributed to subscribers for publication by Cagle Cartoons,
      Inc.<BR>
      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is becoming likely that
      nothing will change or that if a bill does emerge from Congress
      it won't be a bipartisan approach. It will be signed, sealed
      and delivered by Democrats. It will be wildly unpopular. And
      it probably will fail to cut costs, insure more people and help
      stabilize our economy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Instead of having a serious,
      reasoned, bipartisan discussion about how to solve the health-care-insurance
      mess, we are acting like lynching mobs, willingly led by red-faced,
      know-nothing bloviators with microphones.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One reason for mad August is
      that we are scared. Old values are disappearing. The jobs our
      parents had are gone or no longer pay a living wage. Politicians
      have abused our trust, getting us into wars we can't win, spending
      our tax dollars foolishly and leaving us with huge debt. The
      house we sank our life savings into is worth half of what we
      paid. And if we get sick or injured, we're in serious financial
      trouble. So-called experts say that if we aren't saving impossible,
      gargantuan sums, retirement will be a nightmare.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another reason for crazy August
      is that getting outraged is a kind of catharsis. It gets the
      juices flowing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One good development is that
      Consumer Reports magazine -- published by a nonprofit research
      group that evaluates products and services without taking advertising
      money -- has begun evaluating ads for and against health-insurance
      reform. It offers reasoned, unemotional evaluations at <A HREF="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/health">http://blogs.consumerreports.org/health</A>.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The current blog features the
      vapid, uninformative new ad featuring Harry and Louise, who,
      15 years later, are now for reform. &quot;A little more cooperation,
      a little less politics, and we can get the job done this time,&quot;
      says Louise. The blog says the best thing about it is that Harry
      and Louise look fit, possibly because of good health insurance.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We have to hope that September
      brings a little more reason, a little less emotion. We need to
      take a deep breath, actually listen to what is being proposed
      and work for improvement. We also need to remember that it is
      against the law to threaten the life of a member of Congress,
      even in the heat of August at a rancorous town-hall meeting.</FONT></P>
