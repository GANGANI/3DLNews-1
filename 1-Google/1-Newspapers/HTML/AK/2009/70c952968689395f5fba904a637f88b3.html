      Bob McNabb, 23, is just beginning what may be a long career studying
      glaciers. No matter how many seasons he spends on ice, he will
      probably never have a field experience like his first.<BR>
       <BR>
      In May 2009, McNabb shot and killed a polar bear that was charging
      him outside a research station in Svalbard. The doctoral student
      observing an extremely far-north glacier in the Norwegian territory
      spoke about his experience when he returned to Fairbanks, where
      he studies at the Geophysical Institute at the University of
      Alaska Fairbanks. </FONT></P>

      This spring, McNabb traveled to the island of Nordaustlandet
      in Svalbard. The Connecticut-size island is just 10 degrees latitude
      shy of the North Pole. An ice cap covers 80 percent of its land
      area. The few mammals on the island include walrus, arctic foxes,
      and polar bears. No people live there.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;It's one of the most remote places on Earth,&quot; said
      Regine Hock, McNabb's advisor and a scientist at the Geophysical
      Institute.<BR>
       <BR>
      A research station built by Swedish, Finnish, and Swiss researchers
      for the 1957-1958 International Polar Year still stands on the
      island. It's called Kinnvika. The station, consisting of a main
      building, several others, and an outhouse, is right on the coast,
      where polar bears sometimes wander the beach. McNabb encountered
      the polar bear outside of one of the snow-drifted frame buildings.<BR>
       <BR>
      McNabb woke in the chilly research station on the afternoon of
      May 10 after a long night in which he worked on nearby Franklinbreen
      Glacier. His coworkers, from universities in Sweden and Finland,
      were still sleeping when McNabb thought of heating water for
      coffee. </FONT><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0"

       <BR>
      &quot;I was getting wood together for the stove when I heard
      glass breaking in the hallway,&quot; McNabb said.<BR>
       <BR>
      He heard more smashing, coming from the room where his shotgun
      leaned against a wall. He yelled out &quot;Hello,&quot; and got
      no reply. Then, above the drifted snow on a window right next
      to him, he saw the polar bear's paws pressing against the glass.
      They were the size of dinner plates.<BR>
       <BR>
      He slipped into the next room, the one with the broken windows
      and the shotgun, and picked up the gun. His mind raced at what
      to do next.<BR>
       <BR>
      He remembered that one of his colleagues had shooed away a bear
      a few days earlier by starting a snowmachine and revving the
      engine. McNabb decided to cautiously step outside and start a
      machine. He thought the noise would also alert others to the
      bear's presence, and going outside seemed more logical than staying
      in the station.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;(The bear) seemed determined to get inside,&quot; McNabb
      said. &quot;I did not want to be in the house with the bear,
      and I didn't want somebody else to come out of the sleeping hut
      (a nearby building) and walk right into it.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      Slowly turning the door latch and pushing it open to the cold,
      McNabb didn't see the bear at first. Looking out, he noticed
      the closest snowmachine had a pull-rope start, rather than an
      electric start. He didn't want to risk taking the extra time
      to start the first machine, so he walked a few steps farther,
      toward the machine with a push-button starter.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;While I was going for the next one, the bear came around
      the corner,&quot; McNabb said.<BR>
       <BR>
      The bear looked at McNabb from about 90 feet away. McNabb raised
      his shotgun and fired a warning shot into the air.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;It sniffed the air, looked at me, and then charged,&quot;
      McNabb said.<BR>
       <BR>
      He raised the shotgun to his shoulder, firing four times at the
      white bear. The bear stopped its advance, growled, and shook
      its head. It turned away, ran about 120 feet, rolled over on
      the ground, and stopped moving.<BR>
       <BR>
      McNabb ran back inside the building and reloaded his shotgun.
      He then went and told two Swedish logistic officers stationed
      there what had happened. Those men went out and confirmed the
      bear was dead. They then called the governor of Svalbard, who
      advised them to remove the bear's stomach before foxes began
      feeding on the carcass.<BR>
       <BR>
      Preservation of the stomach was essential for determining the
      animal's condition for an investigation by government officials
      of Svalbard, where polar bears are protected.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;(Killing a polar bear) is assumed to be a crime until proven
      otherwise,&quot; said Hock, who taught in Svalbard earlier this
      year. &quot;There's always a legal investigation.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      A Svalbard police unit flew up to the Kinnvika station where
      McNabb shot the bear. They measured tracks as they recreated
      the incident, finding that the bear was about 60 feet distant
      when McNabb began shooting, and the bear turned away when it
      was 25 feet from McNabb's boots. Though the government officials
      have not yet ruled whether McNabb would be fined for shooting
      the bear, both McNabb and Hock said they believe the evidence
      for self-defense was obvious.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;They found it was a male with nothing in its stomach,&quot;
      McNabb said. &quot;Before it tried to break into the building,
      it tried to eat two seats on the snowmachines. It was starving,
      I would guess, at that point.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      McNabb, a native of Kalamazoo, Michigan, had recently taken the
      university's shotgun training course taught by Fairbanks resident
      Joe Nava; he had also practiced shooting both at the Svalbard
      city of Longyearbyen and at the Kinnvika station.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;It was a good thing I had both the shotgun class and the
      other shooting experiences,&quot; he said. &quot;The class was
      the first time I'd picked up a gun in 13 years.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      A few weeks after the experience, McNabb said, &quot;the movie
      of it has stopped playing in my mind.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;After the bear fell down, I was still rushing on adrenaline,
      hoping the bear wasn't going to get back up,&quot; McNabb said.
      &quot;Once I realized it was dead, I felt pretty sad about it.&quot;<BR>
