      Tuesday</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      &quot;It wasn't my fault. I glanced at my text message for only
      a second when the car in front of me hit me.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;How could the car in
      front of you hit you?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The idiot stopped to
      let a dog cross the street -- and dented my front bumper with
      his rear bumper. Yet the cops wrote me up for texting while driving!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You speak of a spate
      of new distracted-driver laws that are emerging across America.
      The problem has become so pervasive, the federal government conducted
      a National Distracted Drivers Summit a few weeks ago.&quot; </FONT></P>

      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;A summit for distracted
      driving?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Yes, and with good reason.
      Last year, some 6,000 people were killed -- and 515,000 injured
      -- because of accidents caused by distracted drivers.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Really?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The fact is people are
      not good at multitasking while driving. Carnegie Mellon University
      found that talking on a cell phone reduces activity in the brain's
      parietal lobe by 37 percent -- which means you're less able to
      focus on driving.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You want to reduce activity
      in the parietal lobe, try driving while the wife keeps telling
      you which way to turn.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;According to The New
      York Times, a Michigan professor found that when someone tries
      to multitask, important neural regions in the brain must switch
      back and forth. This opens up opportunities for serious mistakes
      behind the wheel.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Look, I'm in sales and
      on the road a lot. I've gotten pretty good at talking, eating,
      texting and driving. It wasn't my fault some idiot front-ended
      me.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You'd think it would
      be simple common sense -- that people would know better than
      to try to text and drive or take cell phone calls while they're
      roaring down a highway at a high rate of speed -- but that isn't
      the case.&quot;</FONT></P>

      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;But it's not my fault
      the wife wants immediate answers when she texts me -- as if the
      world is going to end if I don't text her right away that I didn't
      forget the milk (even though I always forget it).&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You'd think there would
      be no need for laws and penalties to prevent distracted driving,
      but, unfortunately, there is.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;How so?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Look, our roadways have
      changed significantly over the years. For starters, many of our
      cars are so comfortable and quiet, people forget they're operating
      a two-ton hunk of steel. They're able to zone out to music or
      yap on the phone, oblivious to the millions of things that could
      go wrong.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;But I invested a lot
      of dough in my sound system. It would be a waste not to blast
      the speakers!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;To make matters more
      challenging, there are lots more cars on the road. Americans
      own 2.3 cars per household. Thirty-five percent of American households
      own three or more cars.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;So we're a rich country.
      What's wrong with that?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It only means that there
      are lots more drivers on the road -- drivers of every age and
      experience level. We know, for instance, that teen drivers are
      distracted more easily than older drivers -- especially when
      their peers are in the car with them.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The wife and I solved
      that problem. We got our daughter a '76 Pacer. She never leaves
      the house.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The point is, the more
      distracted drivers there are on the road, the greater the opportunity
      for accidents. And add to that challenge a mix of new technologies
      -- cell phones, iPods, laptops, GPS devices -- and you have a
      recipe for disaster.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      &quot;If you say so.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Look, many people are
      wary of the government intervening in our lives, but there is
      wide agreement that this is one area where the government needs
      to intervene. Many states have implemented distracted driving
      laws and with good reason.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I don't think such laws
      should pertain to me. As I said, I'm very good at multitasking
      behind the wheel. Sure, I cut off other drivers now and then
      but even they praise me for my skills.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;They do?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Why else would they give
      me the 'You're No. 1' sign?&quot;</FONT></P>
