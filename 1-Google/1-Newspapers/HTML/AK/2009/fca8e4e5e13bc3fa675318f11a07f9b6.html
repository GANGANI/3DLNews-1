      </FONT></I></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Three years ago
      the World Health Organization issued a global alert about a dangerous
      strain of <A HREF="http://www.sitnews.us/MacDougall/011706_macdougall.html">bird
      flu</A> that was migrating from China.  Now they're warning us
      about a highly contagious Mexican strain of <A HREF="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html">swine
      flu </A>- or, as vegetarians might prefer to call it, the <I>other</I>
      white meat influenza.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The WHO recently raised their
      pandemic alert to the fifth of 6 phases leading up to a global
      pandemic, the last of which ran its course from 1968 to 1969
      and was estimated to have killed a million people - the majority
      in Hong Kong.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Flu vaccination has become
      much more widely available since then, and public health systems
      have many more containment tools at their disposal - such as
      infrared cameras to measure the body temperatures of passengers
      disembarking from a plane.  And for those that do get sick, there
      is the balm of Gilead Sciences - the California pharmaceutical
      company that developed the antiviral drug marketed as Tamiflu
      by Hoffmann-LaRoche. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But forewarned is forearmed,
      and with the ubiquity of cell phones and the Internet, I would
      think that people all around the world have their chemical defense
      systems, such as soap, Clorox, and <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir">Oseltamivir</A>
      at the ready, even if their biological immune systems are unprepared.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Amazingly, the legions of people
      who read Nicholas Kristof's columns in the New York Times, myself
      included, were eerily on alert for a swine-related epidemic one
      week before this one started.  On March 11, Kristof reported
      on widespread cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      - better known as MRSA, or just &quot;superbug&quot; - in the
      small town of Camden, Indiana, which has several industrial-sized
      pig farms nearby.  One week later, health officials in Mexico
      reported the first surge in illnesses that we now know were swine
      flu.  The outbreak has been traced to the small town of La Gloria,
      in the Mexican state of Veracruz.  Like Camden, La Gloria is
      near an industrial-sized pig farm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While I suspect that these
      two towns smell the same, the epidemics that they are suffering
      from are quite different.  The MRSA infections are bacterial,
      and the swine flu infections are viral.  And if you think chemistry
      class was complicated, the biochemistry of pathogen attack and
      immune responses is like chemistry on steroids.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For instance, you might have
      heard that the bird flu was a H5N1 influenza A virus, while the
      swine flu is H1N1.  And back in 1968, the culprit was H3N2. 
      The H's and the N's do not refer to atoms of hydrogen and nitrogen
      like they do in N2H4, the chemical formula of hydrazine - or
      &quot;rocket fuel&quot; - which has two atoms of nitrogen and
      four of hydrogen in each peppy molecule.  Viruses are much smaller
      than bacteria, but they are still complex assemblies of numerous
      and various molecules, many of which are large and complex themselves.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All influenza viruses contain
      RNA molecules that encode their identity the way that our DNA
      identifies us.  Just like some of our genes encode for the chemical
      composition of the protein molecules that determine hair color,
      certain influenza genes encode for recognizable chemical features
      on the external surface of a virus.  Two of these types of large
      molecules are <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin_(influenza)">hemagglutinin</A>
      (a protein/carbohydrate blend) and neuraminidase (a bond-cleaving
      protein enzyme), and these are what the H's and the N's of the
      flu type refer to.  And just as there are different hair colors
      and eye colors, mutations of the virus lead to variations in
      the chemical compositions of these surface molecules.  The numbers
      refer to common mutations of each molecule.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are many other types
      of molecules on the surface of a virus, just as people have many
      external features in addition to hair color.  But H and N are
      the targets of our immune system and antiviral drugs such as
      Tamiflu, respectively, so they are commonly used to classify
      strains of the influenza virus.  The variation in the strains
      is much more complicated than suggested by H5N1 vs. H1N1, but
      I would have to mutate into a virology professor to adequately
      explain it to you.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lastly, some of the swine flu
      reporting has been a bit sloppy, and suggested that the new virus
      has genetic make-up that &quot;is a mixture of human, bird and
      pig&quot;.  What this refers to is the combination of RNA components
      from human, avian and swine strains of the flu virus.<BR>
