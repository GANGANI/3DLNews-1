      Thursday</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Swine flu could soon be slaying scads of us, some think, and
      the Indiana health commissioner says don't shake hands with anyone.
      Vice president Joe Biden says try to avoid subways or planes.
      European governments say don't travel to the United States. And
      people are buying up protective facemasks left and right.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Maybe a deadly pandemic is
      in fact on its way - some reputable experts think as much. But
      maybe the much-cited example of the millions-killing Spanish
      flu of 1918 is less a guide to our immediate health future than
      the swine flu scare of 1976.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Gerald Ford was president that
      year. He got caught up in the panic, spent $135 million on productions
      of a vaccine, urged people to get shots and, according to one
      account I ran across, even appeared on TV getting a shot himself.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That was a brave thing to do,
      as it turned out. While the flu didn't kill anyone in the United
      States, the shots did kill and caused neurological disorders
      in yet more, leaving people paralyzed as a consequence of nothing
      but unwarranted dread.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's reported that this current
      flu is dissimilar in a variety of ways, and it's said, too, that
      the slight signals of the moment could portend something large
      and awful, especially since this flu is easily spread by human
      contact.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The last time I looked, Mexico
      was reporting more than 2,000 cases and 170 deaths (although
      the World Health Organization said confirmed fatalities were
      in single digits). There had been one death in the United States
      -- a Mexican child -- but nowhere else. New cases were cropping
      up in various spots around the world, though not in large numbers.
      The reported concern was that even if the flu is not yet fiercely
      virulent -- it so far seems mild -- it could mutate into something
      worse.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A voice of wisdom on such issues
      is Michael Fumento, a science writer. When some scientists were
      worrying about millions dying almost immediately from bird flu
      several years back, he calmly looked at the facts and said it
      just didn't seem likely. He was right. Concerning the 1918 flu
      that did result in millions of deaths, he points out that most
      died from secondary infections that today could be treated by
      antibiotics and other medicines that did not then exist.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fumento gives us some context,
      too. Seasonal flu hits millions of Americans every year, leaving
      an estimated 36,000 dead. Those who die from flu are usually
      the least healthy among us, which is why flu fatalities are far
      more likely in undeveloped than in developed countries.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">President Obama is seeking
      $1.5 billion to develop a vaccine for the new flu, demonstrating,
      among other things, how much prices have gone up since Ford's
      time. This move on his part may be wise. It could take several
      months to find something effective, and you don't want to postpone
      the effort until you know for sure that this flu's dangers merit
      the investment. Actually administering the vaccine still might
      not be advisable after you got it, though.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This much seems sure -- such
      decisions should not be driven by speculative fear, possibly
      giving us a cure worse than the disease. The overly prompt warnings
      about not coming to the United States are themselves worrisome.
      If governments go so far as to disrupt trade out of flu concerns,
      they could make the recession worse and deprive nations of necessary
      products, one Internet piece warns.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While I pretend to no insight
      into the flu other than what I read, I do know that news outlets
      exaggerate. I know that politicians overstate things. And I know
      that unintended consequences time and again wreck the best-laid
      plans of mice and men.</FONT></P>
