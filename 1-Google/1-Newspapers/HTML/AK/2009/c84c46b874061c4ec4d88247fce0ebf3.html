      Here's a hint, David Letterman: An apology starts with you admitting
      you were totally wrong... no equivocation... no explanation...
      no rationalization; it ends with you expressing your sorrow,
      giving a promise that it won't happen again and offering an act
      of contrition (such as your resignation or self-imposed suspension)...
      no smirking... no laughing... period.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Your &quot;apology&quot; to
      Sarah Palin and her daughter is totally insufficient. She should
      have never accepted it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For anyone who missed the brouhaha,
      you missed Letterman joking about the rape of Palin's 14-year-old
      at the hands of a professional baseball player. And you missed
      him calling Palin &quot;slutty.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Letterman's attacks on Palin are just the latest example of media
      bias out of control. Even the late-night comics can't keep out
      of the bash-Palin game. The election is over, but they still
      can't resist the cheap shots.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The facts don't lie; almost
      all programming conceived and controlled by the elites of network
      programming contains a blatant liberal and pro-big-government
      bias.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But the attacks on Palin go
      beyond bias and are a clear attempt to destroy her because as
      a beautiful, well-spoken, conservative female, she is threatening
      to the liberal machine that runs America.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As John Ziegler in his excellent
      documentary &quot;Media Malpractice&quot; has demonstrated, during
      the 2008 election the press moved from liberal bias to advocacy.
      In the movie, Ziegler demolishes Letterman's employer, CBS, for
      their earlier mistreatment of Palin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But CBS is not alone in the
      2008 distortion game. While The New York Times published a highly
      critical report alleging that John McCain had an affair with
      a lobbyist and questioned whether he was eligible to be president
      because he was born on a military base, they ignored questions
      about Obama's eligibility and his extreme inexperience.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Rather than talk about the
      issues, the media were busy ogling a shirtless Obama and elevating
      him as the world's newest celebrity. Chris Matthews even reported
      that Obama gave him a tingly feeling in his leg, and he stated
      it was his job to make the Obama presidency a success.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The media have only gotten
      worse since the election. In recent weeks, Obama made the claim
      that his stimulus bill has &quot;created or saved&quot; over
      150,000 jobs and will do the same for roughly 600,000 jobs this
      summer. This claim is completely fabricated; even the director
      of the Bureau of Labor Statistics admitted they could not prove
      how many jobs they have created and saved. Would President Bush
      have been allowed to con these same journalists by fabricating
      a story to back up his economic proposals?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The news media have ceased
      reporting the news; instead they focus on celebrity worship of
      Obama. On a recent hour-long special with Obama, host Brian Williams
      asked him no substantial questions, but he got Obama to plug
      the new &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host, Conan O'Brien. Then Williams
      bowed down to Obama as they parted ways. If we hadn't seen it
      ourselves, we wouldn't have believed an anchor of a major news
      broadcast would bow to any president.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      But it gets worse, on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews,&quot;
      the editor of Newsweek, Evan Thomas, while calling Reagan &quot;parochial,
      chauvinistic and provincial,&quot; stated that &quot;Obama is
      standing above the nation, above the world he is sort of god.&quot;
      This is the same Evan Thomas who in 2007 stated, &quot;Our job
      is to bash the president, that's what we do.&quot; Evidently
      the media only bashes the president if he is a Republican.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The media adulation is getting
      ridiculous. Reese Schonfeld, the former president of CNN, in
      an article on Huffington Post argued that crazy Obama-haters
      were driving up Fox's ratings. These liberal media elites simply
      don't get it. The American people want to watch the news, not
      uncritical praise of Obama's every move. Last Monday, Katie Couric
      drew the smallest audience for &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; since
      1991; you would think these folks would get the message. Stop
      treating Obama like the messiah, or viewers will tune in elsewhere
      to get their news. Right now people are flooding away from the
      mainstream media and watching Fox News or tuning into websites
      such as WorldNetDaily.com. People want objective and factual
      reporting, not propaganda.</FONT></P>
