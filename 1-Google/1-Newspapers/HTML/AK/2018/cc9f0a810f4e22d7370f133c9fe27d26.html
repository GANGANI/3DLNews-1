          Tuesday PM</p></CENTER><P><br>
        (SitNews) - I&rsquo;m trembling&hellip;.<br>
        I&rsquo;m shaking&hellip;.<br>
        I&rsquo;m convulsing&hellip;.</P>
        <p>Due to my White &ldquo;Cis&rdquo; Patriarchal Privilege I was blind-sided (no offense to blind people) recently with a term I have never heard before, &ldquo;She-Sheds.&rdquo; For years I gloated to my wife over my regal, rules-free &ldquo;man-cave,&rdquo; free from her feminine OCD. In one such recent argument about me not putting my shoes &ldquo;away&rdquo; and my complaining about how strict her rules are.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I indignantly argued, &ldquo;Yes, you own and run the entire house, BUT my dearest&hellip;&rdquo; I exclaimed in between puffs on my Peterson Amber briar pipe, &ldquo;I OWN the Man Cave and no rules of yours apply there! In fact, after I make an addition to the back room, I&rsquo;m going to put a patio in the backyard with a BBQ pit and I&rsquo;ll put my shoes where ever I want there!&rdquo; I put my pipe-down on the cedar table and picked up my martini (stirred not shaken, dirty and with two olives) savoring a taste with a smug grin spreading on my handsome rugged face.&nbsp;</p>
          <table width="500" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center"><p><img src="http://www.sitnews.us/ArthurMartin/101618_she-shed.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="303"/></p></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>&ldquo;Not so fast&hellip;&rdquo; she answered back in a dangerously silky tone and approached me.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I already told you last month, I&rsquo;m building a she-shed in the back yard.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>My smile slowly disappeared and changed to indignation and then confusion, &ldquo;You said no such thing!&rdquo; I exclaimed puffing out my chest and slamming the martini glass on the table watching drops from the drink spill onto my pipe and then on the glossy tabletop. &ldquo;And what the hell is a She-Shed?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a typical male millennial!&rdquo; she scoffed, putting her hands on her hips glaring up at me.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;A she-shed is a small&nbsp;bungalow, my own private retreat, that will help me &lsquo;shed&rsquo; all the stress of living with you Arthur,&rdquo; I noticed that she let out a loving sigh after she said my name. &ldquo;Good&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;she still respects and adores me.&rdquo; Picking up my pipe again I sized her up, &ldquo;Ok&hellip;.&rdquo; I began, &ldquo; but what the hell is a bungalow?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo; She exclaimed, snatched the pipe out of my hand and stormed off.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; I replied, confusion fully replacing my demeanor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So here I am, dear reader, sitting in my man cave over looking the backyard, which will no longer have the 3-Piece BBQ Island with the 32 inch BBQ Grill I envisioned.</p>
          <p>The imagined patio will continue to be imagined and instead, replaced by another female dominated &ldquo;safe space&rdquo; for my wife. I feel crowded and suffocated. My patriarchal privilege should have guaranteed me easy victory over my wife&hellip;after all she is just an oppressed woman and I am the Kingly and Demure Despot.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the outcome of our debate, in my infinite humbleness I searched within my self for some uplifting news&hellip;some jewel of positivity that I could take out of the argument and then it finally hit me,&nbsp;THERE ARE NO TRANS-SHEDS. NO NON-BINARY BUNGALOWS. ZERO GENDER-FLUID FLOPHOUSES!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Imagine the horror dear reader!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Here we are in the current year of 2018 and while selfishly men and women are egotistically arguing over man-caves and she-sheds (and BBQ&rsquo;s) a much worse atrocity is happening! LGBTQQIP2SAA have NO place to escape to in their home to &quot;shed&quot; the oppression of 21st Century Air-Conditioned Modern Living!&nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <p>How we haven&rsquo;t addressed this insult to our mis-gendered minorities is&hellip;I hate to say it&hellip;.a blight on American Civilization and Culture.</p>
          <p>Sure, America iconized the 1st Amendment&nbsp;<br>
            Sure, America donates billions of dollars to 3rd world countries<br>
            Sure, America desegregated the military, schools and everything else<br>
            Sure, America (due to the Wagner Act) allowed workers to organize into Unions creating the biggest Middle Class after WW2</p>
          <p>All those thing are&hellip;well they are OK&hellip;the &ldquo;last frontier&rdquo; in America is not Alaska (heh), the last frontier is finally stepping up to create architecture for the sexually un-labeled.</p>
          <p>Which is why I am taking a stand. Creating a petition. Mailing my representatives and DEMANDING a formal marketing campaign that is fully gender-inclusive!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>So to all my vis, xyrs, hirs, zers and Zhems out there,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I know that I was born a Cis-White Male&hellip;a gender that I did not chose&hellip;I was born into it. A Patriarch from birth I became and a Patriarch till death I shall be, however, that will not stop me from supporting anyone who should want to build a trans-tower, a lesbian-love-shack, a binary basilica or a Queer-Gurdwara. I am with you in unity, in spirit and in resolve to cast off the sexist oppression of man-caves and she-sheds and unite by building sexless-shacks. It&rsquo;s the least I can do as retribution for having my BBQ patio replaced with a She-Shed.</p>
