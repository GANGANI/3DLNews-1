      <h2>COVID cancels entire cruise ship season; International pandemic affects all residents, even those that remained healthy</h2>
By DAVE KIFFER 
        <p align="left" class="style8">January 02, 2021<BR>
         Tuesday AM</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8"><br>
          (SitNews) Ketchikan, Alaska - Like the rest of the world, the biggest news story in Ketchikan was the quarantine caused by the Corona Virus or COVID 19.  Most of Ketchikan was shut down from mid-March through the end of April harkening back to the month- long closure of the Ketchikan economy and social world for a month during the Great Flu Pandemic of 1918.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">By the end of the year, the COVID 19 virus had infected more than 250 residents and local visitors. One Saxman resident, Julie Wasulli, 56, was medivaced to Bellingham in November and died on December 11.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The economic effects were extremely serious as the 2020 Cruise Ship season was cancelled and the community had to hunker down to survive the loss of more than 1.2 million visitors and more than $150 million in economic activity in 2020.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Local school children also experienced a major disruption when in-person classes and activities were canceled and students were sent home in March to finish their school year on computers. The high school spring sport seasons were cancelled and summer sports like soccer and Little League had shortened seasons. Fall sports like cross country, swimming and volleyball also had shortened seasons or were limited to home meets instead of traveling in the region.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Numerous other activities were affected as many local restaurants and entertainment facilities faced closures or were limited to being half full because of state COVID restrictions.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Many traditional local events like the salmon derby, the Blueberry Festival, the Clarke Cochrane Basketball Tournament and the Winter Arts Faire were also cancelled.  Other events were held over the internet and many local residents became familiar with zoom meetings replacing in-person meetings for local government and other functions. A significant portion of the community workers also spent time &ldquo;telecommuting&rdquo; to work when offices were closed.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Federal and state relief money arrived in the community and more than $20 million had been doled out by the end of the year, providing rent, utility and business assistance.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8"><strong>JANUARY</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Ketchikan&rsquo;s first significant snowfall of the past three years arrived shortly after New Year&rsquo;s when more than a foot of snow descended on much of the community. A spate of cold weather and some additional snowfall, kept the snow around until the last week of January</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Longtime Ketchikan city councilman and Mayor Lew Williams III died on Jan. 4 after a three-year battle with cancer. Williams, who served for more than 30 years, was also the co-publisher of the Ketchikan Daily News.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The first Ketchikan baby of the new year was&hellip;from Wrangell. Braven Hunter Gillen, the son of Michaela Larsen and Tyver Gillen of Wrangell was born on Jan. 7.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style8">The US Army Corps of Engineers approved a permit for the Ward Cove Dock group to build a cruise ship terminal in Ward Cove to handle two 1300-foot cruise ships. Construction started almost immediately. In the meantime, because of previous delays, Norwegian Cruise Lines &ndash; which will have preferential berthing at Ward Cove &ndash; announced it would likely continue to berth ships in downtown Ketchikan after the original July 1 switchover date. Those plans became moot when the season was cancelled several months later.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Paul Robbins was appointed to a seat on Ketchikan School Board, replacing Matt Eisenhower who resigned in December.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Randy Williams, Judy Leask Guthrie and Lloyd Ruaro won seats on the Ketchikan Indian Community Tribal Council. Kevin Johnson and Dawna Hull were elected to the KIC Health Board</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Emily Chapel was appointed to a seat on the Ketchikan City Council, replacing Lew Williams III who resigned in December.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Several Ketchikan residents returned from a nearly year-long deployment to Kuwait. Sgt. Patrick Brown, Sgt. Charles Cessnun, Spc. Tiara Manalo, Spc. Kodie Moss and Staff Sgt. Keefe Blankenship are part of the Alaska Army National Guard&rsquo;s 297th Military Police Company.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce celebrated its community members and businesses of the year. The late Lew Williams III was named the Citizen of the Year. Theresa Hamilton received the outstanding community service award, Brittany Pope received the emerging leader award. Island Pharmacy was the business of the year and the Alaska Crepe Company was the entrepreneur of the year.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Tessa Axelson was named the new executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, replacing Owen Graham who had held the post since 2001.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The Ketchikan City Council&rsquo;s long process to determine how to manage the local ports took a big step when three companies offered proposals for future port management. All three companies, Global Ports Holding, SSA Marine/Royal Caribbean and Survey Point Holdings proposed getting management concessions from the city rather than seeking preferential berthing opportunies.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The state ferry Matanuska &ndash; which just returned from a lengthy overall &ndash; suffered a broken reduction gear and was taken out of service, leaving the AMHS with a single operating state ferry, the Lituya, making runs between Ketchikan and Metlakatla. After several weeks, the ferry system &ndash; plagued by budget cuts and ferries needing maintenance &ndash; got the Tazlina on the Lynn Canal route and serving some smaller SE communities. Governor Dunleavy appointed a commission to determine the future of the system.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8"><strong>FEBRUARY</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Lifelong residents Jim and Juanita Diamond celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Tom Heutte was appointed to a seat on the school board that was vacated by Rachel Breithaupt in January.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The project to eliminate a rock pinnacle off the shore from Berth 2 turned up a historical oddity. An old &ldquo;admiralty&rdquo; anchor was uncovered. The nine-foot, 1,000-pound anchor was the type used on ships between the Civil War and the mid-20th Century. It will be displayed on the docks near Berth 1.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Houghtaling Elementary School Fourth Grader Thierry Oyedeji won the school district spelling bee. The winning word was b-e-a-t-b-o-x-i-n-g.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style8">A landslide seriously damaged Tatsuda&rsquo;s IGA causing the closure of the store and the adjacent Alaska Liquor Store. Eventually the stores were torn down and &ndash; at year&rsquo;s end &ndash; there was no announced plan to replace them. Tatsuda&rsquo;s has operated in Ketchikan since 1916 and went through a major remodel to celebrate that anniversary four years ago.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8"><strong>MARCH</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The city began negotiations with the state and the federal government over ways to mitigate the need for a $70 million drinking water filtration plant. Part of the reason for the filtration need was blamed on increased turbity in the Ketchikan Lake water supply because of recent heavy rainfall. Federal officials also pointed to increased fecal coliforms in the water that had been traced to a growing mountain goat herd in the area.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style8">Kayhi senior Chris Lee was named to the basketball all-state first team.  Elijah Casperson, Colton Hayward and Alexis Russell, all of Metlakatla, were also named to state 2A honor teams. Russell was named the girl&rsquo;s player of the year for Division 2A.

        <p align="left" class="style8">The Corona virus arrived in Ketchikan March 13 when a local resident who returned from the Lower 48 tested positive. By mid-month, there were five other positive tests and &ndash; like much of the rest of Alaska &ndash; Ketchikan was under a &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; recommendation that closed most businesses and offices. By the end of the month, there were 14 cases in the community, but none reported in any other SE communities other than Juneau. A Petersburg resident getting medical treatment in Seattle died of COVID. Residents were told to not gather in groups of 10 or more. Schools were closed until May 1 and all spring sports were canceled. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Students at UAS-Ketchikan began taking classes on-line. Residents who returned to the community from travel elsewhere were required to self-quarantine for two weeks and Gov, Dunleavey banned any non-essential travel within the state. Canada announced it was closing its cruise ship ports until July 1 meaning that few cruise ships would visit Ketchikan prior to that time. The port of Seattle also closed its ports until July 1.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">By the end of March, the community was on an unofficial lock down and transportation in and out was limited to one flight in and one flight out. The Marine Highway System &ndash; which had been expected to resume service by early April - was also on hiatus through May. The IFA also cut back on its trips to Prince of Wales Island.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The City Council stepped into some controversy when it briefly considered allowing idled cruise ships to dock at the port, but then said no when public opposition was vociferously opposed. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Initially public parks and beaches were kept open, but by the end of the month they had been closed because people were not practicing social distancing.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Amidst the corona virus outbreak, another tragedy struck Ketchikan when five-year-old Jaxson Brown died in the woods near the Lunch Creek Trail. Brown and his mother were hiking and became lost. When the mother decided to go for help, she was severely injured and both spent the night out in freezing temperatures. The mother was rescued but it was two more days before searchers found Jaxson&rsquo;s body.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The local lockdown would last from March 17 to April 26, with businesses such as bars and restaurants, as well as churches, remaining closed until mid-May.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style8">Further chaos hit the local ferry system as the IFA&rsquo;s Prince of Wales suffered a massive engine failure and went off-line leaving POW without service until the AMHS Lituya altered its schedule.

        <p align="left" class="style8"><strong>WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The snowy and icy weather that began the first week of January lasted into February, causing a run on ice melt and rock salt, snarling traffic and causing numerous &ldquo;closures.&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">A two-day hurricane blew into the region in mid-January with 80 mph winds recorded in Ketchikan and 109 mph winds recorded at the airport. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Ketchikan enjoyed several weeks of sunny, albeit chilly. weather from mid-March through April.  The nice weather allowed many socially isolated residents to take long walks during the COVID 18 outbreak. Everyone was walking six feet apart, of course.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">In late April, a windstorm with gusts up to 80 briefly shook things up.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">A pre-season heat wave hit the First City on May 8-9-10th with temps of 70, 78, and 73 at Ketchikan International Airport. The 78 was an all time high for the date. NOAA also reported that a recording station at Mile 13 North Tongass had a temperature of 80 on May 9, the first 80-degree temperature in Southeast in 2020.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">In celebration of upcoming summer solstice the skies opened on June 18 and more than 3.5 inches of rain, setting an all-time record for that date.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">July 10 was also an unusually wet day with more than 2.76 inches of rain falling, it wasn&rsquo;t quite a record. Both June and July had rainfall amounts that were significantly above normal. But not records.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">There was a brief respite to the rain the last week in July when temperatures reached into the upper 70s and even 80 on July 30. Then came August which was the wettest on record with more than 24 inches.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">So, the summer of 2020 was wet. Very wet. How wet? The wettest in his recorded history with 47.99 inches of precipitation being recorded in June, July and August, exactly an inch more than the previous record in 2017. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">Naturally, Ketchikan followed up a wet summer with a much drier than normal Fall, right up until Halloween weekend. On Halloween itself, Ketchikan got nearly 4 inches of rain, but then the deluge really arrived on the first of November. More than 6 inches of rain was recorded, breaking all the all-time Nov. 1 record of 3.94 inches. It could have been worse, a rain gauge at Silvis Lakes in the mountains behind Beaver Falls recorded more than 10 inches!</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The rain continued through November with the month ending up north of 30 inches or twice normal. Ward Lake rose enough to flood the main shelters and almost completely submerge the ones at Grassy Point. The last week of the month, three different days recorded more than 4 inches of rain. The heavy rainfall in late November and early December raised local lakes to their spill level and there was concern about flooding along Ketchikan Creek but that didn&rsquo;t happen. From the last couple of days of November through the end of the first week of December, Ketchikan recorded more than 22 inches of rain in one eight-day period, the most in such a period since 1920.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">For the record, Ketchikan ended up with just about 176 inches of rain in 2020. Much more than normal, but nowhere near the two highest years of 202 inches in 1949 and 196 inches in 2005.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style8">The high temperature for the year was 80 degrees and the low was 2 degrees. There were 280 days with measurable precipitation in 2020.        </p>
