      I've only been driving about 45 years, so I don't consider myself
      an expert; experienced, yes, but an expert, no.  I've driven
      the Los Angeles freeways at rush hour, Highway One in the fog,
      the Mohave Desert in the heat, and the West Virginia turnpike
      when it was only a three-lane road.  I've passed snowplows in
      winter storms, done Three-Sixties on ice-covered two-lane roads
      in Pennsylvania, dealt with black ice in the high desert of Idaho,
      and dodged oak trees driving under the influence on the back
      roads of coastal South Carolina.  But I've never driven &quot;from
      Tucson to Tucumcari, or Tehachapi to Tonopah.&quot;  So I'm not
      an expert.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I've been driving in Atlanta
      for about 11 years.  I go to work at 6 a.m. because nobody schedules
      meetings at 6 a.m.  You get no points for coming in early, only
      for leaving late.  The reason people leave late is because they
      spend all day in meetings and can't get any work done.  I go
      in at 6, finish most of my must-do work by 8, and have the rest
      of the day to attend meetings, where nothing is accomplished.
       I know you're wondering how I can get my work done in two hours.
       Well, how long should it take to answer, forward, or delete
      email messages?  What's difficult about listening to voicemail
      messages?  The bulk of my work is done out in the field at the
      power plants where the real work is going on. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Driving to work at 6 a.m. means I'm in the dark most of the time,
      both figuratively and literally.  So my other drivers are dehumanized
      into oncoming headlights and receding taillights - or sometimes
      rapidly approaching taillights if I'm not paying attention. 
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Once in awhile, someone may
      even use a turn signal, usually after they have cut in front
      of me.  People fly around me all the time.  They want to be ahead
      of me at the next light.  I don't know why.  They can't go any
      faster than the guy in front of me is going.  In general though,
      people in Atlanta do not use their turn signals the way they
      were meant to be used.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We have turn signals on our
      cars to tell other drivers what we are about to do, not what
      we did.  Cutting someone off and then turning on your turn signal
      is a victory sign, not a warning.  It's a way of saying, &quot;Screw
      you,&quot; courteously, I guess.  But the worst things people
      do with their turn signals is leave them on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most of our major intersections
      in Atlanta have left turn lanes and lights that provide a green
      arrow so lefties can make their turns safe from oncoming traffic.
       It is a simple concept; they paint big white arrows on the pavement
      to show it is a turn lane; and they put signs overhead saying
      &quot;Left Turn Only.&quot;  So it's obvious that if your car
      is in the lanes painted with big white left arrows, under signs
      saying &quot;Left Turn Only,&quot; in front of traffic lights
      with green arrows pointing left, you are probably going to make
      a left turn when the light changes.  Then why would you want
      to keep your left turn signal flashing the whole time you are
      sitting there waiting for the light to change?  What could you
      possibly communicate to the driver behind you that he or she
      hasn't already figured out?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Maybe they've changed the driver
      education courses since I learned to drive.  I asked my son if
      they taught him he had to have his turn signal on in order to
      turn at an intersection. Was there some kind of interlock between
      the steering wheel and the turn signal stalk that prevented turning
      the wheel unless the turn signal was on?  He said, no.  Good,
      because if there was, it didn't work on any of my cars.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I've developed a bad habit
      since I began driving in Atlanta.  I don't use my turn signals
      much.  Oh, I did when I first started driving here, but quickly
      learned that if you signal you're going to make a right turn,
      drivers making left turns will cut you off.  It's safer to pretend
      you are going to go straight and then turn at the last minute.
       The driver behind you might get upset, but that's what brake
      lights are for.  He was probably following too closely anyway.
       Now, if the fellow in the oncoming lane decides to turn in front
      of you, you have a problem.  And that's why God gave man the
      ability to invent collapsing steering wheels, airbags and seatbelts.
       Even if you never take a risk, the probability of death is still
      100 percent.<BR>
