      Ketchikan, Alaska - Since my family is apparently the only one
      in North America to not go &quot;cellular&quot; that puts us
      in a unique position to observe the ways that other folks use
      their cell phones &quot;conveniently&quot; intrude upon our lives.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">First off, there are good reasons
      to have cell phones in Ketchikan. If you are hiking - for example
      - and you get in trouble, a cell phone can be a life saver. Same
      thing if you are boating and something goes wrong. Being able
      to communicate could be the difference between life or death.</FONT></P>

      Heck, I even accept the use of cell phones in the grocery store
      because it could be a matter of life and death if you bring home
      the wrong thing. A short telephonic consult in the vegetable
      aisle could - at the very least - save a marriage.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Unfortunately, having those
      CCD's (Convenient Communication Devices) on hand at all times
      can also be life-threatening. A couple of weeks ago, I had two
      close encounters while driving.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Heading up Bawden Street, I
      had to swerve suddenly when a car backed out of one of the parking
      spaces. That's a hard place to back out because all the big trucks
      (another column!) block your view up and down the street. But
      in this case, the young woman wasn't even looking because she
      was - drum roll please - talking on her cell phone. I very nearly
      hit the side walk trying to avoid the rear end of her car.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I continued farther up the
      street - grumbling to myself of course - when I noticed a car
      turning really widely off of Pine onto Bawden Street. Once again,
      I swerved and this time hit the curve trying to get out the way
      of the other car. Why was the other car in my lane? Because the
      young woman driver was trying to hold her cell phone to her ear
      with one hand while turning the steering wheel with her other.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps, most disturbing about
      both close encounters was that both drivers were so distracted
      that neither even noticed that they had nearly hit my car. They
      just burbled on down the road as if they and their conversation
      were the only thing happening in the world.</FONT></P>

      I guess it wouldn't bother me so much if I thought that the young
      women were having important conversations . But somehow I doubt
      it. Here is a verbatim transcript of what I heard (you can hear
      at least half of every cell phone conversation these days) waiting
      for a light to change on a street corner downtown a few days
      ago.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Well, Like that's what
      I said. Really.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Yeah, like that's what
      I said I said.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I said that too. Really.
      I said that too.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;No, really. I said that's
      what I said.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Clearly an exchange of information
      critical to preserving life as we know it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's probably just sour grapes
      on my part because I'm not important enough to be on the phone
      24/7. After all, a cell phone ringing the &quot;Hall of the Mountain
      King&quot; establishes once and for all that the holder of said
      item is a serious queso grande (big cheese). Like in the old
      days when a doctor's beeper would go off and he or she would
      nod as if to say &quot;Oops, gotta go, gotta save someone's life.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, as often as not, it's
      someone calling for a grocery aisle consult, but I digress.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's not even a shock anymore
      when something important is interrupted by a ringing cell phone.
      Plays, sermons, bathroom breaks. It's all fair game when have
      that&nbsp;star trek communicator in your pocket or purse. Frankly,
      there's no one that I need to contact so badly that I can't wait
      until they&nbsp; - or I&nbsp; - flush.</FONT></P>

      Sometimes the interruption is someone calling out. I was at the
      movie theatre a couple of months ago and a young girl - about
      eight - was loudly whispering the plot of the movie into her
      cell phone to someone who obviously couldn't be there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Last year, I was initially
      amused to her a woman calling someone from a local bookstore
      to consult on a book choice. But it became less amusing as it
      went on for more than 15 minutes with the woman going down every
      aisle.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;What about 'blah, blah?'
      Okay, well then what about 'blah,' Okay. Well, how about 'blah,
      blah, blah' that sounds good. Okay, how about?&quot; Etc etc
      etc. I began praying for an earthquake to strike, knock over
      a shelf of books and smite her.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It didn't happen, but I was
      so mad, I wished I had a cell-phone so I could have thrown it
      at her. Like calling for help in the wilderness, that would have
      been an acceptable use of the convenient communication device.</FONT></P>
