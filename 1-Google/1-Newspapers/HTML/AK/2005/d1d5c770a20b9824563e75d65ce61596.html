      Ketchikan, Alaska - There was an old magazine advertisement for
      sale on EBAY this week (told you they sold just about anything!).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The 1969 magazine ad was for
      Xerox and was what we used to call in the publishing biz a &quot;two
      page spread.&quot; One page was the copy &quot;We service downtown
      locations: Downtown Thief River Falls, Downtown Spearfish, Downtown
      Kodiak.&quot; The ad went on to trumpet the fact that Xerox (The
      Copier People!) were just about everywhere that you needed them
      to be. No matter how &quot;out of the way&quot; the location.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fine. Good job. Way to make
      your point and sell your product. </FONT></P>

      But it was the second page caught my attention. It was a line
      drawing of someone wearing a parka and snow shoes and carrying
      a briefcase marked &quot;Xerox.&quot; The tagline under the picture
      read &quot;Our Man in Ketchikan.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, isn't that special? Sure,
      I know you're thinking that it's not fair to make fun of old
      advertisements (anyone remember the old Marlboro ads for clove
      scented cigarettes that were reputed to &quot;help&quot; asthma
      sufferers?). But the Eskimo-clothed copier repairman is just
      too hard to pass up.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This - of course - falls into
      the &quot;geographically challenged&quot; category that I wrote
      about in a column here just about a year ago. That column focused
      on the lack of individual awareness of the reality of Alaska.
      Since corporations are made up of individuals, it's inevitable
      that they would suffer from acquired intelligence deficiency
      syndrome - a group is no smarter than its stupidest member.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That's what leads a big company
      like Xerox (or at least it was a big company in 1969) to assume
      that Ketchikan is like the rest of Alaska - all snow, ice and
      dog sleds.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I remember the big &quot;hoo-haw&quot;
      that occurred in the early 1970s, when the giant corporation
      AT&amp;T ran a national ad campaign that featured an ad reading
      &quot;If you are billed for a call to Ketchikan, Alaska and you
      don't even know where Ketchikan is.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The idea was that it was easier
      to clear up billing mistakes with the company's new high powered
      computer and improved customer service system.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, naturally, Ma Bell was
      a little unclear about where Ketchikan was. The ad showed a picture
      of a telephone pole standing in a barren, frozen, clearly high
      arctic wasteland. In response, I remember the Ketchikan Chamber
      of Commerce taking out an ad in several national magazines proclaiming
      &quot;We know where Ketchikan is, but where's Ma Bell?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Interestingly enough, Ma Bell
      had used Ketchikan in a national ad campaign 15 years previously
      (to tout new undersea telephone cables to Alaska) and had shown
      the Welcome Arch and the St. Francis Hotel so at one point it
      once knew where Ketchikan was, but apparently had misplaced it
      by 1970 or so.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Television ads are also occasionally
      less than accurate about our fair Salmon City.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I remember watching an ad for
      Holland America cruise line on Boston television in the mid 1980s
      that talked about the culture of Alaska. While the narrator droned
      on about the splendors of Ketchikan, the picture on the screen
      was of an Eskimo blanket toss in Barrow. Close, but no sigarliarlak!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Even closer to home were recent
      television ads for Best Western Hotels in which they talked about
      their Alaska locations and then showed something related to each
      location (Fairbanks - Mt. McKinley, Homer - the Spit, Valdez
      - the pipeline etc etc).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For Ketchikan, they showed
      the Alaska Railroad. Obviously, I missed the construction of
      that little trunk line.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Some of this is just being
      sloppy. As a longtime journalist, I understand and embrace the
      concept of &quot;quick and dirty&quot; sloppiness. Frankly, I
      wallow in it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For example, I really wallowed
      in it several years ago when the statewide tourism promotion
      group bought a series of ads in national newspapers across the
      country extolling the virtues of Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One was a big beautiful four
      color ad that showed the colors of Creek Street on a lovely summer
      day. The ad was produced entirely by the tourism group and was
      &quot;camera ready&quot; something that publishers like because
      they just slap in the magazine or newspaper without any changes.
      And they did.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After all, they couldn't be
      expected to realize that the Alaska group had spelled the name
      of &quot;Alaska's First City&quot; as &quot;Ketchican.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was up to our own brethren
      in Anchorage to be so &quot;challenged.&quot;</FONT></P>
