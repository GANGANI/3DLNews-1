      Ketchikan, Alaska - My four year old asked me an unanswerable
      question last week.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It had nothing to do with where
      babies come from or what happens after a person dies.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Daddy,&quot; he said,
      as we drove through the soggy streets of Our Fair Salmon City.
      &quot;Why do we live where it always rains?&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He has been thinking about
      rain here since we got back from a visit to his grandfather in
      New Mexico a few weeks ago. Granted, he thought it was pretty
      darn hot in the Southwest and complained about that just a wee
      bit. But it was clear he had had his eyes opened to a life in
      which you didn't always grab your gore-tex sun bonnet every time
      you stepped out the door and was very intrigued by it. </FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Does it always rain here?&quot;
      he asked after a few seconds of silence.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was tempted to say &quot;No,
      it will probably stop raining sometime before you turn 10&quot;
      but he's not really good with irony yet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally I answered.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Do you remember going
      to the beach this summer?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He nodded.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Was it raining then?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He shook his head, but not
      with a lot of certainty. I decided to deflect his concerns.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It will stop raining
      after two sleeps,&quot; I said. He smiled.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And it did. We got up two mornings
      later&nbsp;and there was a couple of inches of wet slushy snow
      on the deck. We went outside and had our first official snowball
      fight of the season.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For the record, I have lived
      elsewhere. I have lived places where it didn't rain all the time.
      I have lived places where it hardly rained at all. Once I lived
      in a place (Southern California) where they got 12 inches of
      rain one January and the newspapers started repeating Noah's
      Ark jokes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I have lived places where the
      snow was light and fluffy like down stuffing. In fact, I have
      lived in a place where it was so dry (Wyoming) that it was hard
      to get the snow to even pack together into a decent snowball.
      One early October snowfall led to a snowball fight in our work
      parking lot that was somewhat akin to tossing handfuls of flour
      at each other. It was most unsatisfying.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was not unsatisfying to
      toss a wet, slushy snowball toward my son last week and have
      it land with a loud, resounding &quot;splat&quot; on the deck
      railing. After we got tired of lobbing slush balls at each other,
      we started tossing them off the deck onto Pine Street far below.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Splat. Splat. Splat.
      Splat&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was a quiet morning (snow
      tends to dampen everything here) and the &quot;Splats&quot; echoed
      almost like gunfire. A neighbor opened her door and looked out
      suspiciously. She saw us launching our slush bombs onto the roadway,
      waved, and ducked back into her house.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;What is snow, Daddy?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I tried to explain that it
      was more or less frozen rain, but then he asked how come it wasn't
      like ice. I couldn't think of a non-meteorological answer. Then
      he asked about hail and I didn't do a very good job of answering.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Daddy,&quot; he said
      finally, clearly peeved at my lack of clarity. &quot;I want to
      go to Grandpa's house again. I want to go after sleeps.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I explained that it would be
      many, many sleeps before we would go to grandpa's house. He asked
      it if every snowed at Grandpa's house and I said that it did
      sometimes. He asked if it ever rained there and I said hardly
      ever.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He pondered this information
      as he continued to form slush balls and lob them off the deck.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I want to go where there
      is snow and no rain.&quot; he said after a while.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;How about Antarctica,&quot;
      I offered without thinking.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Where is Ankarktika,&quot;
      he said, drawing the syllables out as if he wasn't sure he had
      heard right.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;South of here,&quot;
      I answered.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Down south by Grandpa's?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Sure.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I want to go there,&quot;
      he said with great enthusiasm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I changed the subject to the
      little birds that were chasing the seeds we had left on the other
      side of the deck. Luckily, I had escaped having to answer an
      unanswerable question: Why we lived in such a dreary, wet, decidedly
      un young child friendly place.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After a few minutes, my son's
      mittens were soaked through and we went back inside. I had to
      spend a few minutes rubbing his hands to warm them up.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Daddy,&quot; he said.
      &quot;Why do we live somewhere that it is soooo cooooolllllld?&quot;</FONT></P>
