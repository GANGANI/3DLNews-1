      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I used to live in Los Alamos,
      New Mexico, which is almost half a mile higher than Denver, the
      mile-high city.  So I know very well how majestic the Sangre
      de Christo Mountains are, and that one need not take in anything
      other than the scenery to feel a &quot;Rocky Mountain High.&quot;
       But this isn't what I am referring to either.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I refer to the natural high
      that we feel when the brain is briefly flooded with endorphins,
      molecules which have a physiological effect similar to morphine.
       (I'll have to trust the literature on that one.)  These molecules
      are &quot;homemade brain food&quot; in the sense that the chemical
      plants in the head office of our own bodies, our brain cells,
      synthesize them out of smaller feedstock molecules on a regular
      basis.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Biochemists are still trying
      to sort out why morphine simulates a strong endorphin response.
       This puzzle is complicated by the fact that there is not <I>one</I>
      endorphin molecule involved, but a family of them.  Our brains
      use these molecules to regulate feelings related to pain, hunger
      and sex, so there is naturally lots of interest in them, both
      medically and commercially.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most endorphins are constructed
      out of a small number of amino acids, from two to a few dozen.
       But since there are twenty amino acids used to construct proteins
      in our bodies, this creates a very large number of possibilities.
       Many endorphin molecules have been isolated from the pituitary
      gland, where they are particularly concentrated, but there are
      certainly many more waiting to be discovered.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The molecular structure of
      morphine has some similarities to simple endorphins, but to a
      chemist the resemblance is not striking.  What <I>is</I> unmistakable
      though, is the feeling of euphoria that accompanies the release
      of endorphins in the brain.  I am told that runners experience
      this approximately midway through a marathon race.  The furthest
      I have run in a race is 10K, which might explain why I don't
      particularly enjoy running.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I doubt that the Greek warrior
      who ran from Marathon to Athens, in 490 B.C., volunteered for
      the task.  After all, legend has it that he collapsed and died
      when he delivered his message of victory.  Yet my good friend
      David Jones is an <I>ultra</I>-marathon enthusiast, racing 100
      miles, often uphill or in the desert. From my perspective, that
      anyone would volunteer to do this, for fun, is tantamount to
      proof that &quot;runner's high&quot; must be a real phenomenon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To athletes, the &quot;agony
      of defeat&quot; may be the flip-side of the &quot;thrill of victory,&quot;
      but for ABC's Wide World of Sports they are both money in the
      bank.  Likewise, as far as brain chemistry is concerned, they
      are both consequences of the same molecular chain reaction.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On rare occasions, the same
      athlete will go from agony to victory, with help from endorphins
      along the way no doubt.  The most obvious example is Lance Armstrong,
      the cyclist from the plains of Texas who survived brain surgery
      and intense chemotherapy after he was diagnosed with testicular
      cancer that had metastasized and spread to his lungs and brain.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While his cancer was in remission,
      he resumed his training, and eventually won the Tour de France
      an amazing six consecutive times.  A feat unmatched in the near
      century of this mountainous bicycle race, but one that he might
      surpass himself in 2005. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My daughter, who was also born
      in Texas, is among the millions of people, young and old, who
      sport yellow LiveStrong wristbands.  For uplifting personal stories
      of courageous battles with cancer, or to contribute to research
      that aims to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors,
      go to www.livestrong.org.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Inspiring? Yes.  Pinnacle of
      athletic achievement?  Perhaps.  Most heroic athletic performance
      by a person living with cancer?   Surprisingly not.  At least
      not for someone living in Canada during the 80's, such as myself.
       Let me tell you about Terry Fox.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Terry Fox was born in the Canadian
      prairies, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  So his geographical origins
      are similar to Lance Armstrong's.  He also had a youth that was
      endorphin enhanced by virtue of his love of sport and athletic
      training.  Unfortunately, he too was diagnosed with cancer at
      a young age.  (Terry was 18 in 1977 when his doctors amputated
      his right leg six inches above the knee in an attempt to stop
      the spread of his bone cancer.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Terry and Lance must have been
      similarly impacted by the courage that they witnessed in the
      cancer wards of their respective hospitals.  While Terry's cancer
      was in remission, he decided to raise money for cancer research,
      and began his own regimen of training for what he would call
      his Marathon of Hope.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Do you have some tissues handy?
       Terry Fox dipped the shoe at the end of a pole-like prosthetic
      serving as his right leg, in the Atlantic Ocean on April 12,
      1980.   He then proceeded to run, with what soon became an endearing
      skip-like gait, across Canada.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He ran a marathon, every day,
      for 143 consecutive days, in rain or shine, or whatever else
      the Canadian weather dished out.  He had covered two-thirds of
      Canada's wide expanse, totaling 5,373 kilometers, when he was
      forced to halt his run near Thunder Bay, Ontario.  His cancer
      had returned, and all the endorphins that his brain cells could
      produce were no match for the pain.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He died within a year, but
      still holding onto the dream of sending his cancer back into
      remission and completing his cross-country race.  He didn't accomplish
      his athletic goal, but his ultimate goal of raising $1 for every
      Canadian was reached while he was alive.  Please visit <A HREF="http://www.terryfoxrun.org/">www.terryfoxrun.org</A>
