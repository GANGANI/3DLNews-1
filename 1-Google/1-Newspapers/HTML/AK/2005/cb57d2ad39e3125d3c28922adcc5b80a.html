      As a political cartoonist I sit around all day watching cable
      news pundits argue with each other. That's what all of the political
      cartoonists do. Our cartoons are nothing more than more screaming
      voices on the editorial page and our cartoons typically amplify
      the standard opinions we hear on TV, where pundits offer ready-made
      opinions on every issue. All I have to do is pick from the tasty
      opinion smorgasbord that is served up to me, 24 hours a day.
      The problem is that lately, I'm feeling a bit overstuffed, and
      the opinions I'm being served aren't tasting very good. </FONT></P>

      By Daryl Cagle, MSNBC.com</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The ready-made opinions on Iraq come in three flavors:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">1. Stay the course and fight
      the good fight for democracy and freedom (this is what the President
      and the far-right pundits tell me).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">2. Iraq is a big mess, but
      it would be worse if we left because there would be civil war
      (this is what most of the pundits tell me).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">3. We should get out now (this
      is what Cindy Sheehan and the far-left pundits tell me).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All of these choices leave
      a bad taste in my mouth. As a cartoonist, I want a bad guy to
      bash. The only good cartoons are the ones that bash a bad guy.
      Most of the cartoonists have chosen to bash President Bush as
      the bad guy for getting us into Iraq and keeping us there. In
      my own cartoons I've chosen to bash the insurgents in Iraq; they
      seem like the obvious bad guys to me. The Sunnis hate America.
      The Sunni insurgents don't have much success blowing up American
      soldiers, so they spend most of their time blowing up Shiites;
      they oppress women, they boycott the elections, they refuse to
      negotiate on a new constitution. They seem like good, all around,
      bad guys.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Shiites are bad guys too.
      They also hate America, they want an oppressive religious theocracy
      to rule Iraq, they oppress women, they are aligned with Axis
      of Evil member, Iran; but at least they negotiate, they vote,
      they don't blow things up as much as the Sunnis, and they are
      the majority in Iraq. I'll call them: &quot;less-bad guys.&quot;
      (We like the Kurds, so we'll ignore them.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The TV pundits tell me that
      we must stay in Iraq because if we leave there will be a terrible
      civil war. All of the options seem dark and gloomy. I wonder
      why none of the pundits ever discuss the bright side of civil
      war. I see four arguments for civil war in Iraq:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">1. There are a lot more Shiites
      than Sunnis, so the &quot;less-bad guys&quot; would win.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">2. With the Shiites fighting
      the Sunnis, we (and the Kurds) can sit back and watch until it's
      over</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">3. We've learned that the American
      army is the world's best at destroying things, but we do a lousy
      job of building things and keeping peace. We should quit trying
      to do the things we do poorly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">4. There will be a lot of death,
      destruction and suffering in a civil war, but many pundits argue
      that our initial war was so clean and efficient in targeting
      only the military and sparing the civilian population in Iraq,
      that the Iraqi people never suffered enough to be willing to
      make the compromises necessary for peace and democracy. Until
      they suffer enough to cry, &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; there is no
      reason to expect the Sunnis to be civil; they lost their man
      Saddam and lost their control over Iraq. Of course they would
      be in a surly mood.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Iraq seems to be having a civil
      war now anyway, but we're keeping the heat down by constantly
      stirring the Iraqi pot. It is a natural American tendency to
      think that if we stir the pot, the stew will be better; but we
      could turn up the heat, sit back and let the stew simmer until
      done. That seems to me to be a recipe that would taste as good
      as any of the others that are being offered to me, and I'd like
      to have it served up along with the other dishes on my TV pundit
      smorgasbord.<BR>
