      Monday</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      There was a light dusting of snow on downtown Juneau as John
      Fraser &quot;Jack&quot; Pugh waited at the steamship wharf for
      the arrival of the Canadian Pacific steamship Princess Sophia
      shortly after dark of Oct. 22, 1918.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This was a welcome relief for
      residents of the Capital City as the late summer and fall of
      1918 had been one of the wettest periods on record, according
      to the Alaska Daily Empire. Just a few days before, a large hillside
      above South Franklin Street had collapsed sending tons of debris
      onto several businesses and homes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The rain no doubt reminded
      Pugh - the head of the US Customs Service in Alaska - of his
      previous posting, more than a decade before, in Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pugh and his wife and young
      daughter (both named Venetia) had spent three years in Ketchikan
      and the former St. John's Episcopal Church Vestry member and
      co-founder of the Ketchikan Masonic Lodge remained popular there,
      as he was in his other previous postings in Sulzer and Skagway.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Pugh also still owned property in Ketchikan, according to the
      Daily Empire, and had expressed interest in returning to the
      First City as his nearly two-decade career with the Customs Service
      was winding down.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But Pugh would never get the
      chance to come back to Ketchikan . The Princess Sophia ran aground
      on Vanderbilt Reef on the return trip from Skagway. Pugh had
      survived several previous steamship groundings in his time in
      Alaska, but this time none of the 350 passengers and crew survived
      when the Princess Sophia went down on Oct. 25, 1918. It remains
      the worst marine disaster in the history of the Inside Passage.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of medium height and handsome,
      Pugh - who was born in Western Washington in 1877 and came to
      Alaska in 1900, was well-known throughout the state for his cheerfulness,
      can-do attitude and natty attire. While other customs officials
      frequently wore the rather bland looking uniforms of the service,
      Pugh preferred high collars, three piece suits and his golden
      pocket watch chain. The Daily Empire reported that Pugh believed
      it was easier to resolve customs disputes if he did not dress
      like a law enforcement officer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pugh had been the head of the
      customs service since 1913. On Oct 22, he was boarding the Princess
      Sophia to go to Skagway on a trouble-shooting mission, according
      to Ken Coates' 1990 book &quot;The Sinking of the Princess Sophia.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;He was preparing to assist
      officials at that northern port and to prevent potential problems
      among the hundreds of people increasingly anxious to secure transportation
      southward,&quot; Coates wrote. C. D. Garfield, the deputy collector
      of customs had been on the Princess Sophia on its northward journey.
      &quot;As he passed Garfield on the dock, Pugh told him that his
      trip to Skagway would likely be a short one, as the imminent
      arrival of the Princess Sophia promised to ease the congestion.
      He would travel back to Juneau with the ship.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Skagway was indeed clogged
      with people on the way &quot;Outside&quot; in October of 1918.
      It was the end of the mining season in the Klondike and even
      though the gold rush was long over, there were still several
      hundred people who spent the summers in the Klondike and the
      winters outside. The October 24th sailing of the Princess Sophia
      from Skagway was one of the last scheduled trips before the winter
      storms would make travel from the Klondike difficult if not impossible.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As a result, there were more
      than 400 people either in Skagway or on their way to Skagway,
      to catch a steamship south, either the Sophia or its sister ship,
      the Princess Alice, which was also heading up the Inside Passage
      three days behind the Sophia.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In order to hold more passengers,
      company officials in Vancouver had outfitted the Sophia to carry
      350 passengers on its voyage, 100 more than normal, by adding
      more &quot;buoyancy tanks&quot; and converting unused space on
      ship to berths. Since the sinking of the Titanic six years earlier,
      ocean-going ships had been required to provide ample lifeboats
      and other devices. The buoyancy tanks were designed to remain
      floating and had ropes in order for the passengers to hang on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Princess Sophia had joined
      the Canadian Pacific Inside Passage run in 1912, the year before
      Pugh was named head of the entire Alaska customs operation. She
      was a functional if not a particularly pretty ship.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;She was not a beautiful
      princess but a sturdy, somewhat chunky down to earth lady of
      the seas,&quot; wrote Betty O'Keefe in her 1998 book &quot;The
      Final Voyage of the Princess Sophia.&quot; &quot;She was practical,
      comfortable and soon became popular with those who traveled the
      West Coast to AlaskaHer cabins provided an uncommon comfort compared
      to the primitive housing and rigors of isolated living to which
      they were accustomed.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">O'Keefe wrote that the ship
      was referred to by some as the line's &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;
      and was slower that the competing ships - the Prince George and
      the Prince Rupert - of the Grand Trunk Pacific, the forerunner
      of the Canadian National marine service. While most of the other
      ships that plied the Inside Passage were low, sleek vessels with
      only a couple of decks, the Princess Sophia was one of a new
      breed of passenger ships that had four and five decks and also
      served as freight haulers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Scottish built Princess
      Sophia was 245 feet long, had a beam of 44 feet and 2,320 gross
      tons. Her high superstructure made her seem a little &quot;chubby&quot;
      O'Keefe wrote. She had a cruising speed of 14 knots.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Like most of the Inside Passage
      steamships, the Princess Sophia had more than a few accidents.
      By 1918, she had run aground on three separate occasions, most
      notably in 1913 on Sentinel Island - just four miles from Vanderbilt
      Reef - on the run south from Skagway. In 1918, she was under
      the command of Captain Leonard Locke, who had been helming ships
      on the northern run for more than 16 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After the Pugh boarded the
      Princess Sophia, it pulled away from the Juneau dock. It arrived
      in Skagway at 1 pm on Oct. 23. The original plan was for the
      ship to load and head south at 7 pm but the Whitehorse to Skagway
      train was late the ship was held back as Pugh and the other customs
      workers strove to &quot;clear&quot; all the passengers and deal
      with the chaos at the dock.. The Princess Sophia headed south
      into Lynn Canal at 10:30 pm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The weather, which had been
      fairly mild for the past couple of days in Lynn Canal, was already
      beginning to turn and a freshening north wind soon began to push
      the Princess Sophia southwards.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The weather suddenly
      worsened and a blinding snowstorm overtook the ship from the
      north,&quot; Coates wrote in his book. &quot;A strong wind, gusting
      up to 50 mph, whistled over the mountain, blowing heavy snow
      before it. The water turned rough boiling with heavy rollers
      and whitecaps. It was a bad storm, but Captain Locke had faced
      worse and coastal mariners were used to running in white out
      conditions. He decided not to slow down.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">William Stokes on the fishing
      boat &quot;Electo&quot; was also fighting the storm in southern
      Lynn Canal that night, according to Coates.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Battling the wind and
      gusts of driving snow, he reached shore, tied a line to a rock
      and prepared to wait out the storm,&quot; Coates wrote. &quot;The
      frantic tossing of his boat kept him awake, and about a half
      an hour after midnight he heard in the distance the foghorn of
      a large ship coming from the north. For over an hour he lay awake
      following the sound, which approached, passed him and faded to
      the south as the Princess Sophia made her way at speed down the
      channel towards Juneau.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      According to Coates, one reason the Sophia was sounding its horn
      was it was likely using the echo determine the distance from
      the sides of the canal.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Exactly what happened next
      has been lost to history, at some point in the darkness and the
      swirling storm a navigation error was made and the Princess Sophia
      began moving to west. At 2:10 am, she ran directly onto Vanderbilt
      Reef.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Because the reef was
      so low in the water the bow lifted out of the water and, with
      a horrible grinding and tearing, slid up and onto the rock,&quot;
      Coates wrote. &quot;Despite the terrific force of the impact,
      there were few if any injuries because most of the people were
      in bed.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">What was going through the
      minds of the passengers can only be guessed at but at least two
      letters written by passengers during the time the ship was marooned
      on the reef did survive the ship's destruction.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I am writeing this my
      dear girl while the boat is in grave danger,&quot; wrote John
      Maskell in a letter to his fiancee. &quot; We struck a rock last
      night which threw many from their berths, some were crying, some
      too weak to move, The life boats were swung out in all readiness,
      but it would have been madness to launch.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Maskell's letter included a
      hastily scrawled last will and testament.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But another passenger, Auris
      McQueen, was more upbeat in a letter he wrote to his mother.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;There was some excitement
      but no panic,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Two women fainted some of
      the men too, kept on life preservers for an hour or so and it
      seemed there was no chance for us, but we passed the first danger
      point we are all mighty lucky we are not buried in the sea water.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Captain Locke sent out the
      first distress calls to company officials in Juneau and Skagway
      and at dawn the crew assessed the damage. Initially it appeared
      that the ship had not suffered catastrophic damage and that the
      double-hulled bottom of the ship was holding.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After daylight on Oct. 23 several
      rescue ships arrived on scene but it was determined to still
      be too stormy to remove the passengers. It was also decided to
      wait to see whether the ship would free itself on high as other
      ships had frequently done in groundings up and down the coast.
      There was also a general belief amongst the crew of the Sophia
      and the potential rescuers that the storm was weakening and that
      it was safer to wait to evacuate the passengers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In light of what eventually
      happened, the decision to not try to remove the passengers at
      the earliest possible time was second guessed and faulted in
      inquiries, stories and books for the next 80 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The primitive communications
      of the era also exacerbated the situation. In some cases messages
      sent from the stranded ship to company headquarters took several
      hours to arrive and be answered. Communications between the Sophia's
      captain and the rescue ships standing often had to be delivered
      by shouting over the wind.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to both the Maskell
      and McQueen letters, passengers were nervous during the long
      wait but no panic ensued. There was a general feeling that the
      ship would either free itself from the reef or the passengers
      would be transferred onto the other ships.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No personal messages were sent
      from the ship to anyone outside, except for a short message from
      Jack Pugh to his wife Venetia, who was waiting at the dock in
      Juneau for his arrival.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;High and dry on Vanderbilt
      Reef; perfectly safe and happy&quot; was all it said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pugh had traveled the Inside
      Passage enough to understand that groundings were a fact of life
      for the steamships in an era of poor communications and even
      poorer navigational aides. In 1913, he had been one of the survivors
      when the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's steamer State of California
      had struck a rock in Gambier Bay south of Juneau and gone down
      with a loss of more than 30 lives.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But when the tide came in,
      the Sophia didn't float free. Plans were made to take off the
      passengers the next morning, the morning of Oct. 25th. That morning,
      the regional newspapers carried the first word of the grounding
      to the outside world. There were comforting words from company
      representatives indicating that the bad weather was abating and
      that the passengers would be rescued soon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But as dawn broke on Oct. 25,
      it was already clear that the weather was not cooperating. Weather
      records were not kept for the Berners Bay area of Lynn Canal
      in those days, but skippers of the boats waiting to rescue the
      passengers estimated that the wind increased to nearly 100 miles
      per hour and seas rose to over 30 feet. Even as far away as Sitka,
      a sharp drop in barometric pressure signaled a major storm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The boats that were standing
      by the stricken liner agreed to head for shelter behind nearby
      islands at mid day.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At 4:50 pm, the wireless operator
      of the Sophia, 20-year old David Robinson, sent out a frantic
      distress message.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Ship Foundering on reef.
      Come at once.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Several of the ships tried
      to leave their havens but were beaten back by the storm. At 5:20
      pm. Robinson sent out another message.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;For God's sake hurry,
      the water is coming into my room.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The wireless room was on the
      top deck of the ship, next to the bridge.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The wireless operator on one
      of the rescue ships made contact with him and suggested saving
      his batteries by only transmitting if absolutely necessary.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Alright, I will,&quot;
      Robinson answered. &quot;You talk to me so I know you are coming.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That was the last message from
      the Princess Sophia.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;For nearly 40 hours the
      Princess Sophia had sat firmly wedged on Vanderbilt Reef, her
      stern pointing north into the wind and her bow in the general
      direction of Juneau,&quot; Coates wrote. &quot;Now the wind and
      waves began to lift the stern off the reef. Under their force
      the Sophia rose, then swung slowly around in a 180 degree turn
      as if on a pivot and the Princess Sophia began inexorably to
      move off the reef into deep water, the rocks ripped gaping holes
      in her hull tearing out virtually the entire bottom.&quot; </FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the water rushed in, the
      ships boilers exploded killing some of the passengers, many others
      suffocated in the thick bunkler fuel oil that was spilling into
      the water around. Very few apparently died from drowning, according
      to the inquest into the sinking. There was evidence that one
      person, the ship's second officer Frank Gosse, may have made
      it to shore before possibly dying of exposure.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There was a single survivor
      of the wreck. An English setter owned by one of the passengers
      was found at Auk Bay, 12 miles from the wreck, starving and covered
      with oil two days after the sinking. Coates reports that the
      dog suffered an extreme fear of water for the rest of its life.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At seven the next morning,
      the wind had abated enough for the rescue ships to return to
      the site. They reported that the Princess Sophia had slipped
      off the reef and that only the forward mast of the ship was showing
      above the water. For several weeks, bodies were recovered for
      miles up and down Lynn Canal. Divers also retrieved many bodies
      that were trapped in the wreckage of the ship.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jack Pugh's body was found
      on Oct. 29 at Tree Point on the north end of Douglas Island.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two days later, Oct. 31, he
      was buried in Evergreen Cemetery.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Jack Pugh was one of
      the most popular men holding office in the territory and his
      friends were legion,&quot; reported the Daily Empire. &quot;News
      of the arrival of his body spread like wildfire throughout the
      town and while it caused sighs of relief, it emphasized the feeling
      of personal loss to the hundreds of friends of the popular official
      and citizen. Minds that had been stunned by the awfulness of
      the catastrophe reverted to introspection and permitted grief
      that had been held in reserve to find expression.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Flags were flown at half mast
      and banks closed during the funeral. But there was not a large
      attendance at the gravesite. The first cases of the Spanish Influenza
      had been diagnosed in Juneau a couple of weeks earlier and the
      Masons - who conducted Pugh's funeral - asked people to stay
      away to prevent spread of the burgeoning epidemic. The sinking
      itself was only big news for a matter of days, until the World
      War I armistice knocked it off the front pages.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Among the mourners were Pugh's
      wife and teenaged daughter.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Venetia Pugh later remarried
      and became the deputy clerk of the US Court in Juneau. She also
      co-owned a tea shop. She died in Anchorage as Venetia Pugh Reid
      in 1967.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1930, she created a crazy
      quilt commemorating the events of her life. It was&nbsp;made
      out of her old dresses and the ties that Jack Pugh had worn.
      That quilt is now owned by the Alaska State Museum.</FONT></P>
