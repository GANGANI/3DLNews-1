      Ketchikan, Alaska - Like many Alaskans I have a Jay Hammond story
      to tell.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hammond - who died last week
      at 82 - was one of the &quot;big three&quot; Alaskan governors.
      I don't necessarily mean that he, Bill Egan and Wally Hickel
      were the best Alaskan governors, just that they dominated Alaskan
      politics even when they weren't in sitting in the governor's
      office. They cast bigger shadows. And Hammond - with his rugged
      Alaskan Central Casting outdoorsman image - clearly cast the
      biggest. &nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Part of that image, &quot;The Man of the People,&quot; led to
      him being remarkably approachable for a politician. I first met
      Jay Hammond in 1980 by walking up to his office in the state
      Capitol building and asking to speak to him. Try doing that California's
      Governor Arnold or Jeb Bush of Florida. To quote Jeb's brother
      &quot;It aint gonna happen.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was scrounging around trying
      to find a &quot;career&quot; after washing out of music school
      and I had talked myself into a &quot;job&quot; volunteering in
      the news department at KRBD FM. My duties mainly involved occasionally
      reading the news for the evening newscast, writing up some sports
      stories&nbsp;and hanging about filing things and making sure
      the tape deck batteries were charged. In the spring, I decided
      to go to Juneau for a few days to visit an ex-girlfriend (hope
      springs eternal!).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When I told KRBD news director
      Will Selzer that I'd be in Juneau for a few days, he thought
      for a minute.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Take a tape deck and
      interview the Governor,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Sure,&quot; I replied,
      not thinking this was anything out of the ordinary.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, 25 years later in a career
      of journalism and writing, it occurs to me that you don't just
      walk up to a state governor and say &quot;talk to me.&quot; But
      back then, I didn't know any better. After all, as a seven year
      old, I once told an older man&nbsp;talking to my father on a
      street corner&nbsp;that his shoe-lace was untied. After the man
      tied his shoe and left, my father pointed out that he was Governor
      Egan, on a visit to Ketchikan. But, as usual, I digress.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To make things easier, Will
      gave me a list of important questions to ask Governor Hammond.
      They focused primarily about what projects or state money Ketchikan
      could be looking forward to in the future. There were also some
      questions about the newly hatched Permanent Fund and other regional
      issues such as fishing and timber.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Tape recorder in hand, I walked
      up to the governor's office on the third floor of the capitol
      building and asked to speak to the governor. I think I even said
      please.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">His secretary looked an appointment
      book on his desk.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;If you come back tomorrow
      at 1 pm, you can talk to him for 20 minutes.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;How about a half an hour?&quot;
      I asked brazenly. Selzer had given me a long list of questions!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">She smiled.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Twenty minutes is a half
      an hour for Governor Hammond,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As I was walking out the door,
      I realized that she hadn't even asked me what I wanted to talk
      to the governor about.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The next day I was there punctually
      at 12:55 pm. By 1:01 I was in his office, sitting before his
      massive desk which was piled high with paper.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;What can I do for you?&quot;
      he asked.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I explained who I was and why
      I was there. He graciously swept aside some of the papers on
      his desk and allowed me to put the tape recorder right in from
      of him</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I reached into my pocket for
      the questions. The paper was gone. I froze. There were several
      seconds of silence.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He looked at me and smiled.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I lost my list of questions,&quot;
      I mumbled.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He laughed. A big, bear hug
      of a laugh.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Son,&quot; he said. &quot;You
      don't get to be governor without knowing the answers to the questions
      even before they're asked.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He paused for a minute and
      then began talking about Ketchikan projects in the capital budget.
      Without a break, he segued into some initiatives he had in mind
      for the timber and fishing industries. Then he talked about the
      Permanent Fund and the Dividend that was being debated. He did
      this all without notes or even referring to any of that paper
      piled on his desk. I don't think I said more than about 10 words
      the whole time. I didn't need to.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Occasionally, his secretary
      would come in and hand him a note. He would nod or shake his
      head and she would go back to the outer office.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At one point, I stopped the
      tape to turn the cassette over. He paused - almost in mid syllable.
      I was well beyond my 30 minute limit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, about five minutes
      later, he stopped.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;That's plenty for your
      radio station,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I have asome questions
      for you.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He asked what my family did,
      how long we'd been in Alaska. We talked about fishing, we talked
      about hunting. We talked about all sorts of stuff. He was very
      interested in what I was planning to do with my life once I stopped
      &quot;volunteering&quot; for the radio station.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I noticed the clock behind
      him on the wall read 2:10.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I guess, I shouldn't
      be keeping you,&quot; I said, somewhat horrified that I had taken
      up so much of his time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;One last thing,&quot;
      he said. &quot;There's a paid internship program this summer.
      We'll be taking 10 young people to work in some of our state
      departments.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He handed me a piece of paper
      with a name and number on it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Give this woman a call,&quot;
      he said. &quot;She's coordinating the program.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I did and several months later
      I got one of the internships. I figured since I now &quot;knew&quot;
      the governor, I'd get the cushy internship in his office.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Didn't happen. I was assigned
      to work on public relations in the State Department of Labor.
      That was okay, the people were great to work with and the internship
      paid better than &quot;volunteering.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One day, I was sitting at my
      cubicle&nbsp; working on a press release about a new job training
      program and my boss poked her head in.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I just had a meeting
      with the Commissioner (of Labor),&quot; she said. &quot;He had
      a cabinet meeting this morning.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">She paused and a slight smile
      crossed her lips.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Governor Hammond asked
      the Commissioner to tell you 'hi.'</FONT></P>
