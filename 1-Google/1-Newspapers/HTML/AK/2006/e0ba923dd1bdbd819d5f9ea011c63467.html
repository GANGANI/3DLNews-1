      It seems like almost everyone is a walking tinderbox these days.
       Some folks think that the country is going to hell in a Longaberger
      basket, while others are convinced that the devil - when he shows
      up for work at The New York Times - wears Prada.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Should small-talk shift from
      the weather to politics, I am worried that July 4th fireworks
      might come a bit early this year.  To defuse this situation,
      I suggest that, for this year anyway, we celebrate Independence
      Day with a slightly different spelling: Independents' Day. </FONT><TABLE

        </TR>
      </TABLE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This would be just as historically
      accurate, since the signers of the Declaration of Independence
      were all Independents, as far as I can tell.  Political parties
      were a fact of life in the Kingdom that we &quot;dissolved political
      bands&quot; with in 1776.  For instance, the Tories were a 17th
      century political faction that formed in the Kingdom of Great
      Britain over the terms for succession to the throne.  Members
      of the conservative parties in Canada and Britain are affectionately
      (or not) referred to as &quot;Tories&quot; to this day.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I suppose that many of the
      56 signers of the Declaration of Independence had political leanings
      one way or another.  After all, many of the examples of the &quot;tyranny&quot;
      of King George III, which are cited in the Declaration, involve
      legislative matters such as taxes and foreign policy.  Political
      alliances form and dissolve all the time.  However, it seems
      that breaking up is harder to do.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They did though, break up that
      is, and when I recently visited Constitution Gardens in Washington
      DC (just north of the Reflecting Pool in the National Mall).
       I noticed that something was missing among the 56 signatures
      to the infamous &quot;Dear George&quot; letter.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Parenthetically, if you haven't
      been to Constitution Gardens, enlarged replicas of the Declaration's
      signatures are carved in big stone blocks that can serve as benches
      beside a tree-lined pond in a part of the Mall that I found surprisingly
      lacking in tourists.  It was just me and some Canada geese -
      perhaps they were feathered tourists.  If they were, judging
      by the offerings left by the signed stones, they must have been
      Tories, descended from Loyalist geese that migrated north, instead
      of south, in the summer of 1776.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But it wasn't only tourists
      that were missing.  Also missing were parenthetic identifiers,
      such as (Tory) or (Whig), after the signatures.  There were a
      couple of &quot;Jr.&quot;s, a proud &quot;of Carrollton&quot;
      after Charles Carroll's signature, not to mention some famous
      flare underneath John Hancock's John Hancock.  But no hint of
      political parties.  Did they know something that we have forgotten?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We do know how at least one
      signer felt.  In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote: &quot;I am not
      a Federalist because I never submitted the whole system of my
      opinions to the creed of any party of men, whether in religion,
      in philosophy, in politics, or anything else. If I could not
      go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nowadays, of course, the parenthetic
      identifiers (R) and (D) are stamped on virtually everything political.
       In some ways, the political division of the country reminds
      me of the Periodic Table of the Elements (not to be confused
      with the <A HREF="http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/elephant.html">Periodic
      Table of the Elephants</A>, a creative project of students at
      Patapsco High School and Center for the Arts in Baltimore County).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One way that chemists divide
      the periodic table is into two broad regions: metals and non-metals.
       Elements that are on the fence, such as silicon, are called
      metalloids, and they form a zigzagging diagonal line from boron
      (around Minneapolis) down and over to astatine (near Atlanta).
       Metals are on the left and non-metals are on the right.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On most periodic tables, hydrogen,
      a non-metal, is at the top-left corner and is thus misplaced
      in this regard.  Although, recent laboratory experiments have
      shown that under the enormous pressures that would be experienced
      at the heart of gas giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn,
      hydrogen hops the fence and behaves metallically.  Astronomers
      believe this explains the large magnetic fields around these
      planets, much like iron in Earth's core, with the help of a compass,
      can now direct you from the Reflecting Pool to Constitution Gardens,
      without a map.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Dividing the elements into
      metals and non-metals, with a few metalloids in between, is simple
      and convenient, but it is practically useless if one wants to
      construct something functional, like a catalyst for change. 
      That is why, if you look at a chemist's workbench, on any periodic
      table that has signs of frequent use, each element's square is
      jam-packed with symbols and numbers that tell a chemist some
      key chemical characteristics of that element.  This kind of information,
      with the training of a chemical education (and a little luck),
      can direct a chemist on a synthetic path that leads to a catalyst
      instead of crud.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Similarly, I think our country's
      political path forward will have fewer zigzags, and less crud,
      if we disregard the parenthetic identifiers and concentrate on
      who we are as independent elements of America. </FONT></P>
