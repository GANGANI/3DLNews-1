      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Okay, let's try again. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ouch.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sorry, it's not so easy to
      type when your neck and arms are the color and consistency of
      a boiled lobster. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yes, like quite a few of my
      fellow Ketchikander &quot;wet heads&quot; I got a gorgeous burn
      on the Fourth of the July. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sure, I know better. We all
      know better. Waiting for the parade leads to serious burnage
      unless one slathers on the sunscreen or wears a full body tarp.
      But we forget. We are just so happy to feel something non liquid
      on our skins that we don't think about the consequences.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Besides we are too busy greeting
      and being greeted by those folks we only &quot;see on the Fourth&quot;
      that we throw caution to wind and end up soaking in a bathtub
      full of green aloe gel for the next week or so.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Usually we are fooled by the
      clouds. It seems like every fourth starts out a little overcast
      and we can smell a hint of rain in the air (last year, of course,
      there was way more than a hint, but I digress). </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So we leave the house with
      hat and jacket and no sunscreen. Then as we are waiting downtown
      for the parade - which always seems to begin &quot;several hours&quot;
      earlier at Jefferson Street- the clouds part, it warms up and
      the hat and jacket are dropped to the curb.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then the baking begins, but
      by then we are distracted by the constant peering down the street
      to see whether or not the parade is coming (like we can't hear
      the sirens approach, but that is another digression).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Even people who should be immune
      to the &quot;parade&quot; sunburn fall victim to it. It makes
      sense that I would be prone to burns, after all my skin is so
      &quot;fair&quot; that it borders on translucent. In fact, I don't
      need to have x-rays taken because you can just about see my internal
      organs pumping away through my skin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But how come the more swarthy
      folks also get burned? I remember a few years ago noting that
      two non-Caucasian friends had pretty gnarly looking skin peels
      a few days after the fourth. Go figure.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I even had a similar experience
      myself many, many moons ago.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After graduating from Kayhi,
      I went college in sunny southern California. Despite my best
      precautions, I ended up burning off at least four layers of skin
      almost immediately. Finally, by about Christmas, I had become
      immune to further So-Cal sunburns and for the next couple of
      years, I had none. I had the world's most egregious case of the
      freckles, but my skin no longer immediately combusted when exposed
      to the sun.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then I came home of the Fourth
      of July after my second year south. Somewhere along the way,
      I misplaced my trusty, ever present baseball cap. I watched the
      entire Fourth of July parade sans chapeau.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The next day, my forehead was
      so &quot;toasted&quot; that I could barely blink. Apparently,
      that part of body had been covered up while the rest of my body
      underwent the California burning. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I didn't know about aloe in
      those days, so I just slathered on the Noxema. I'm sure it helped
      on some level, but it felt like butter sizzling on my forehead.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So you would think I would
      remember the intensity of the Ketchikan burn, but no. I watched
      the parade on Tuesday without any precaution other than keeping
      my hat on (thank goodness for small favors).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Oddly enough, the burn didn't
      happen during the parade. I know this because I was facing into
      the sun and the most burned place is on the back of my neck.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">How did this happen? It was
      my Mom's fault.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. You're
      thinking that's impossible because Moms always insist that we
      &quot;cover up&quot; when we go out in the sun and even if my
      mom didn't make that specific &quot;nag&quot; before the parade,
      then she had made it often enough over the past four decades
      that it should have sunk in.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">True. But it really was my
      Mom's fault that I got the burn!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My Mom asked me to pick her
      up some food from the booths at the dock this year, like she
      does every year.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So - a few hours after the
      parade - I went down to the dock to get some kebabs and lumpia
      for my mother.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Since the crowds had thinned
      out significantly, it didn't look like much of a wait,. No, I
      didn't slather on the sunscreen. It was only going to take a
      couple of minutes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And it only took about five
      minutes to get the kebabs. So I then got into the lumpia line
      which was a little longer, but certainly not as long as it is
      some years. I soon discovered that the reason the line wasn't
      that long was because it wasn't moving.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At first, we made the usual
      jokes about how the line was going slower than &quot;continental
      drift&quot; but after awhile the wait didn't seem all that funny.
      In fact it started to take on the endlessness of the Bataan Death
      March.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then it became sheer stubbornness.
      After you have spent more than a half an hour in line, you aren't
      going to give up until the EMTs take you away. All the while,
      the sun is beating down on your head (or in my case, my arms
      and the back of my neck.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, after more than a
      hour I reached the front of the line (no exaggeration!). After
      another ten minutes, I got my lumpia and skeedaddled them to
      Mom's house (the kebabs were pretty cold at that point, but that's
      why the creator created the microwave oven).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mom looked at me when I got
      there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Ya got a little pink,
      eh?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, yes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Didn't put on any sunscreen?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, no.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Better get some aloe.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I didn't want to tell her that
      I figured the line at the drugstore was too long.<BR>
      </FONT></P>
