      Ketchikan, Alaska - We all like to be thought of as important.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That's why it is so hard to
      turn down a chance to be &quot;surveyed&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We like to believe &quot;our
      opinions matter&quot; and that's just what the surveyors tell
      us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the last five months, I
      have been phone surveyed five different times. It's like jury
      duty, they say you are randomly selected but - truth is - once
      you answer a survey or show up for jury duty - you seem to find
      yourself being &quot;selected&quot; again and again.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For example, I went years without
      being called for jury duty and then I was called for four straight
      years. Random coincidence? I think not. But as usual, I digress.
      </FONT></P>

      So, for the most part, phone surveys are not really a problem
      for me. I'm always willing to give an opinion, although it does
      seem like they always call around face stuffing time and &quot;this
      will only take a couple of minutes&quot; usually means 10 minutes
      at the least.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I like to try to figure out
      the &quot;slant&quot; by how the questions are asked. Every survey
      has a slant. You just have to suss it out by how the questions
      are phrased..</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was surveyed twice earlier
      this year on the up coming governor's race and it was pretty
      clear by the questions that one survey was being done on behalf
      of the sitting governor and one was being done on behalf someone
      wanting to replace him</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For example one survey question
      centered around how &quot;important&quot; it was for the state
      to have &quot;consistent&quot; leadership. (one to five, with
      one being very important and five being not important at all!)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A question from the other survey
      listed a selection of things that were &quot;wrong&quot; in the
      state today and how &quot;important&quot; I thought it was to
      &quot;improve&quot; things.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">You get the idea.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I tried to answer the questions
      as clearly as possible but frequently they wanted a yes or no
      answer on an issue that was not so clear. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The &quot;slant&quot; of both
      surveys also indicated that no matter what I really thought on
      the issues, the results would be &quot;spun&quot; to produce
      the desired outcome.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two other surveys were about
      the gas pipeline issue that has been leaking around our state
      government this spring.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One survey focused on the potential
      economic &quot;benefits&quot; that would accrue from the proposed
      pipeline deal. The gist of the survey was whether or not I was
      in favor of accruing those &quot;benefits.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The second pipeline survey
      focused on the economic &quot;loses&quot; that would occur from
      the proposed deal. The gist of that survey was whether or not
      I was opposed to seeing those &quot;losses&quot; occur.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, duh.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Like a lot of people, I am
      strongly (one to five with five being high) in favor of &quot;benefits&quot;
      and strongly opposed (one to five with five being high) to &quot;losses.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I hope that answered their
      questions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The fifth survey was about,
      well, I'm not what it was about.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">First of all the surveyor was
      obviously not &quot;from around here.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You are a resident of
      Ket-CHAK-it-can?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Well, sort of.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;And you have lived in
      Ket-CHAK-it-can for how long?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Most of my life.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;And would that be six
      months or less or six months or more?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;More.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;More or less six months
      or more than six months.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;More than six months,
      so far.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Fine. Thank you.. Now
      what is your opinion of the Gro-VINE-Ah access.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You mean the bridge?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;No, the access.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I thought for a minute.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You mean the ferry?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The question just says
      access, sir&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I love it when people call
      me &quot;sir.&quot; It makes me feel very important, kind of
      like a knight.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The only better thing is when
      they call me &quot;Mr. Kiffer&quot; and I look around to see
      if my father is standing nearby. Thank goodness I am a male of
      the species, because otherwise I'd want to deck the first yahoo
      that called me &quot;ma'am&quot; .</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Fine, just say that I
      am in favor of Gro-VINE-Ah access.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Other questions followed, and
      additional names words were mispronounced (the Alask Marin Highway!)
      that I wanted to start laughing and hang up. But I stayed on
      the line because I was still trying to figure out who was &quot;sponsoring&quot;
      such a bozo survey.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was clear the survey had
      something to do with economic development and quite possibly
      the visitor industry, but it was hard to come up with the exact
      &quot;slant.&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I never did figure it out.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, the surveyor concluded.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;My supervisor would like
      to come on the line and confirm this survey,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Sure.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There was a pause.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Hi, I just wanted to
      confirm that you are a resident of Ketchikan, Arkansas?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">You betcha.<BR>
