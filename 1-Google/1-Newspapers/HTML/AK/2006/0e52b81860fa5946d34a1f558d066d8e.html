      Ketchikan, Alaska - I had a weird experience in the aisles of
      Safeway recently.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yes, I know that's not usual,
      but this was even more disconcerting than the normal, run-of-the-mill
      run ins with the usual wackos and miscreants that grocery shop
      after normal hours.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A couple of missionaries, female
      ones, flirted with me.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Okay, maybe they were just
      being really friendly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was in the cold remedy aisle,
      pondering just how it could be that a single medicine could cure
      both runny and stuffy noses.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Suddenly, I noticed a young
      woman was standing fairly close to me. In fact, she was staring
      over my shoulder and at the package I was holding in my hands.
      I looked up and she gave me a great big smile. I smiled back,
      she smiled back. I smiled. She smiled. I got nervous and dropped
      the cold medicine into my basket.<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      It wasn't just the smile that was unnerving. She wasn't dressed
      in that usual &quot;American burqa&quot; female missionary garb
      (long skirt, heavy sweater, hair in a bun, etc). She was dressed
      like just about any other young woman (early 20s). Nice form
      fitting clothes and a slightly exposed midriff. The only clue
      to her missionary status was the name tag.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I started to back away from
      the cold medicine and I bumped into her partner (they always
      run in packs of two) who was standing on the other side of me.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I said &quot;excuse me&quot;
      and smiled. She smiled. I smiled back, she smiled even wider.
      I looked at the first &quot;missionette&quot; and she was still
      smiling at me. I smiled back.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My cheeks were starting to
      sting from this unaccustomed smiling effort. I padded a quick
      retreat up and out the aisle. They smiled and even waved &quot;bye,
      bye.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sure, it's possible that it
      was some new form of soul saving. A new method that harks towards
      Madison Avenue's favorite gambit of using a smiling woman to
      sell any product because American men will associate the smile
      with the product and think good thoughts.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But the young women never said
      a word. No invitation to a service. Nothing. Nada.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As someone in his mid to late
      40s, I am used to being invisible to the young and vivacious.
      And make no mistake, these two young women were clearly on the
      vivacious end of the curve.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I tend to smile and make eye
      contact with whomever I meet in our fair Salmon City because
      I was raised to consider that good manners in a small town.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Usually, I note that my nods
      to the young and vivacious (of both sexes) tend to go unrequited.
      They are usually too wrapped up in their cell phone conversations
      to notice the &quot;Old Fogey&quot; passing by them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But even when they are not
      yapping away on their oh-so-important phone calls, they don't
      notice me. I have reached the stage where I am invisible to youth.
      I am not on their radar and that's just the way it is.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When you are still on the upward
      side of &quot;the hill&quot; you really don't pay much heed to
      those on the downward slope. They are merely those doddering
      old fools who are going a little too slowly in the fast lane
      and are blocking your forward progress, at best, and/or causing
      a serious impediment to same (especially if they are your parental
      units) at worst.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To steal a line from Jerry
      Seinfield, they know they are our &quot;replacements!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They don't want us to &quot;lead,&quot;
      they certainly don't want to &quot;follow&quot; us. The only
      reasonable course of action for us - in their minds - is to &quot;get
      out of the way.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of course, there is an exception
      to the &quot;cloak of invisibility&quot; rule. If the young person
      is selling raffle tickets, then I loom large on their radar,
      but I digress.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So when did I first notice
      this inexorable march of time?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My second attempt at college
      happened when I was in my late 20s and attending college in Boston.
      I was obviously a few years older than many of the other students
      and I thought it was pretty funny, to be sitting in classrooms
      and have other students approach me and ask if I'd sign their
      paperwork so they could get into the class.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I certainly looked old enough
      to a graduate teaching assistant, so it was all in good fun.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then one day I was on the subway,
      riding home from some Christmas shopping. The car was full and
      I was standing, holding on to one of the grab rings, swaying
      back and forth to the &quot;clickety-clack.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My bags of presents were leaning
      against my legs.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There was a remarkably beautiful
      looking young woman sitting nearby as I stood . I didn't even
      realize I was staring at her.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">She looked up and gave me a
      multi-megawatt smile that warmed the winter chill right off me.
      I smiled back. She smiled. I smiled. We had a lovely little flirt
      for a few seconds.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then her brow wrinkled..</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot;
      she said, addressing me as if I were on an outing from the old
      geezer's home. &quot;You looked tired. Would you like my seat?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That was it. I had officially
      become old. It was only a matter of time before AARP came calling.
      I would soon be eligible for all sorts of discounts as well as
      a special meal time at Denny's. It was time to &quot;get my affairs
      in order&quot; because I would - from that day forward - officially
      be perceived as :&quot;old.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Until of course, I found myself
      in the medicine aisle at Safeway, pondering life's imponderables.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Such as how does a cold medicine
      stop a runny nose and unclog a stuffed one at the same time?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And when did missionaries start
      wearing belly button studs?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
