      The Hate and Greed tennis match should have been called Shame-Appaloosa.
      If it is about Gay Marriage, then allow me to interject some
      ignorance to it. <BR>
       <BR>
      I do not care what goes on in another person's closet unless
      they have some of my junk in their trunk. But let s call this
      what it is, Same Sex Marriage. This will allow two cranky Hetero
      Sexual guys to share a house, insurance benefits, and medical
      benefits, get auto insurance breaks (more responsible now that
      they are pretending to be Gay) and pass their Social Security
      benefits to each other after one croaks. All they need to do
      is get legally married in Vegas. They do not need to view each
      other like Dachshunds in heat, nor is there any blood test to
      prove ones gayness. But enough on that debate (genetic or learned)
      because I am writing a futuristic book on this subject, a tease
      about my book is: Shaquille O Neal fertility clinics, and giant
      women who resemble Rosie O Donnell taking over first the NBA,
      then the world. It's fiction, so don' get all freaky on me.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Same sex unions is not about
      gayness, it is about same sex people piggy backing onto the other's
      benefit package, (what ever) and making employers and co-workers
      pay for their sexual preference. Heteros should argue about toilet
      seats being in the locked and upright position (it s in the bible)
      and are better at making little tax payers, and this is why it
      is structured the way it is today.  If this were about love!
      Then why has this thing left out Bisexuals? If one bisexual loves
      a man and a woman, marriage fairness advocates would be promoting
      triangulated marriage, not just two conjoining people who can
      use the same underpants drawer. It is about draining Social Security
      faster and increasing the cost of insurance to all. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Thank you Sitnews for letting
      me drop-in my two hetero scents. Gay guys are cool, cuz they
      can hang out with your ole-lady, never borrow your tools, take
      out the trash and you might get credit for it that night.</FONT></P>
