      In his latest best-seller, for &quot;State of Emergency: The
      Third World Invasion and Conquest of America,&quot; Pat Buchanan
      makes his case that we must move quickly to erect a stronger,
      more restrictive immigration policy to stop and reverse the invasion
      of millions of illegal Mexican immigrants across our southwestern
      border. If we fail to do so, says the conservative populist,
      the United States as we know it will disappear in 50 years. I
      reached the former presidential candidate, political pundit and
      syndicated columnist by phone on Thursday, Aug. 24 in New York
      City, where he was in mid-book tour.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: You have concerns about
      the harmful impact of on our economy, our culture and our politics
      from illegal immigration. What is the most serious problem that
      needs to be addressed first? </FONT></P>

      A: The first one -- as in New Orleans, when the 17th Street levee
      broke &shy; is before you do anything, fix the levee and stop
      flood. Even before you start pumping out the water, even before
      you start bringing folks back to their homes &shy; fix the levee,
      stop the flood. We need to stop the invasion of this country
      with a 2,000 mile security border fence, all the way from Brownsville
      to San Diego.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That is the only thing that
      will do it, because the whole world now realizes America's back
      door is now open. The numbers being apprehended along the border
      in the first five months of 2006 were 150,000 a month. That is
      more people breaking into this country each month than all the
      immigrants who came in the entire 1820s. That is more people
      breaking into the United States each month than all the troops
      we have in Iraq.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is an invasion. And the
      president of the United States is obligated under the Constitution
      to stop that invasion .... That is the first thing that needs
      to be done. All else proceeds from that. You've got a lot of
      other steps, but that needs to be done immediately.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: Who or what is most responsible
      for this &quot;state of emergency&quot;?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: The government of the United
      States has failed to do its duty to enforce the immigration laws.
      It's failed to do its duty to protect the states of the union
      and the American nation from invasion. As a consequence, we've
      got more illegal aliens here than all the Jewish folks, Irish
      folks and English who ever came to America. This is happening
      because of a dereliction of duty on the part of our political
      class. And our social and cultural elites have condoned it. Let
      me say this: The state is basically betraying the nation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: If this doesn't change,
      if immigration isn't restricted, and if the tide of illegals
      isn't stopped and reversed, as you call for, what will America
      look like in 2050?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: Bye, bye, &quot;American
      Pie.&quot; What will American look like? We will be a Third World
      country by national origin. We will be a Balkanized nation. We
      will be what Theodore Roosevelt called &quot;a polyglot boarding
      house for the world&quot; -- not a nation at all. We will be
      a tangle of squabbling minorities &shy; with all of us minorities.
      I think the future of the United States as one nation and one
      people will become an impossibility.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: What should our immigration
      policy look like?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: It should look like what
      John F. Kennedy recommended back in the late 1950s and was repeated
      in his book in 1959, &quot;A Nation of Immigrants&quot;: total
      immigration of 150,000 to 250,000 a year. Let's set a figure
      of 200,000 a year. A security fence across the southern border.
      Enforced sanctions on all employers who hire illegals chronically.
      Those who do so ought to be put in jail or be doing community
      service, publicly. An end to all welfare benefits, except emergency
      services, for any and all illegal aliens. A reinterpretation
      of the 14th Amendment so that some women who the coyotes have
      moved across the border 50 yards and have their babies there,
      are not automatic citizens of America. Congress could handle
      that.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, legal immigrants here
      &shy; once they settle down -- should be allowed to bring their
      wife and minor children. No more extended families &shy; mom,
      dad, brothers and sisters -- because we want immigration law
      returned to the government of the United States and not set by
      immigrants and not set by corporations going abroad hiring whomever
      they want.<BR>
      If you do the steps that I recommend toward the end of this book,
      I believe there is a last chance to get control of this problem.
      But if there is an amnesty, if there is a guest-worker program,
      and if there is no border fence, for the life of me, I don't
      see how you stop 20 or 30 million people from coming in the next
      20 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: How can you have any confidence
      that the people who have botched immigration for the last 30
      or 40 years &shy; politicians, bureaucrats, all the interest
      groups &shy; can ever fix it?<BR>
      A: What makes you think I have confidence in them, ha, ha, ha!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: You've been around Washington.
      You more than anybody should know this is impossible.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: It's not impossible. Look,
      Dwight Eisenhower did it. You know what the name of his program
      was? &shy; &quot;Operation Wetback.&quot; Say that and that will
      be the end of the Tribune-Review, ha, ha, ha!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But that's just it: Political
      correctness is one of the problems. I've got a whole chapter
      &shy; &quot;Why the Paralysis?&quot; One reason is that the corporations
      want open borders. They want to be able to bring in cheap labor.
      They want to be able to go abroad and hire labor and bring it
      to the United States. They want an amnesty for having broken
      our laws. And they pay the tuition in Washington.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: Why can't immigration be
      made more sensible and regulated and controlled, so that immigrants
      from Latin America don't have to sneak across the border at night
      and die and trash the environment and everything else?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: Well, one problem is that
      they come here and they overstay their visas. We've got too weak
      a system that can't run all these folks out. We've got to stop
      it. Here's the thing: We don't need anymore low-age workers in
      America. We don't have a shortage of them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: What do you say to those
      who call you semi-hysterical &shy; that these problems are not
      as dire or inevitably destructive to the United States as you
      fear?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: They called me that in 1991
      and now I sound like a moderate compared to what they're saying.
      If they don't follow these prescriptions, all I'm saying is,
      &quot;Bye, bye to America.&quot; I think the American people
      agree with me and understand this.  </FONT></P>
