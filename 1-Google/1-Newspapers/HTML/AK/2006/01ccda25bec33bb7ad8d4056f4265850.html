      Ketchikan, Alaska - There was a wee bit of a traffic jam on the
      Third Avenue bypass a week ago.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I know because I was at the
      tail end of it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Since I was running late -
      and since I am not a patient, laid back driver - I uttered a
      few trenchant observations about the heritage of the driver at
      the front of the snarl. And, no, my big-eared, five-year-old
      son was not with me at the time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then I discovered the reason
      for the tangle. Three deer were going back and forth across the
      road. This was causing the drivers to slow down and rubberneck.
      After a few minutes, the deer got tired of slaloming the cars
      and bounded (deer always bound) into the woods. Traffic returned
      to normal.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      This was the third time that I had seen deer on the bypass this
      year. A friend reports that she saw a wolf on the bypass one
      morning this spring.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I suspect that the proximity
      to town of wolves might be part of the reason that we've seen
      more deer around this year than last. At any rate, come August
      1 (and hunting season) we won't be seeing that many hooved ungulates
      roaming the local byways.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But the recent sightings are
      just a quick reminder that &shy; for all the civilizing attributes
      of our fair city &shy; we remain a outpost at the edge of the
      wild.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And to be honest I like the
      fact that a small herd of deer is still enough to cause us to
      stop and gawk.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We lost interest in the plethora
      of bald eagles around here years ago. So much so that we smirk
      at the visitors who gather and point at the &quot;National Birds&quot;
      that we don't even notice anymore.</FONT></P>

      &quot;National Scavengers&quot; we retort. We find them about
      as interesting as the pigeons scarfing popcorn downtown. And
      yes I did see a &quot;noble&quot; bald eagle picking away at
      the popcorn in the Redman parking lot next to the Coliseum Theater
      one afternoon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We also don't give much mind
      to the ravens either, unless we catch one in our trash. On the
      other hand, folks goo-goo and gawk at hummingbirds and other
      migratory species that are just passing through. And don't get
      me started on how excited people around here are to see owls.
      Go figure.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bears are another animal that
      always inspire interest. Maybe because they could &shy; if they
      chose to &shy; eat us. Nothing else in the woods &shy; save a
      random pack of wolves &shy; really spells danger like a bear
      encounter. Never mind the fact that nearly all black bear encounters
      around here involve a quick glimpse of a bear behind bounding
      away into the brush. It's the possibility of something worse
      that perks up our adrenalin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One evening &shy; not long
      after we moved into our new house a few years ago &shy; we looked
      up to see a 300 pound Blackie on our deck, staring in at us through
      the sliding glass door. We watched. He watched. Finally, I rose
      up out of my chair and he quickly exited down the deck steps
      and back into the woods. A few days later, he - I assume - spread
      our trash all over the street. Everyone's a critic.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That brings to mind a story
      - possibly apocryphal - that a bear once broke into a local politically
      active attorney's house and had a bowel movement all over his
      desk. Must have been a conservative bear.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      But it also reminded me that a friend who lives in Forest Park
      once came home to find a bear actually reaching through a kitchen
      window to get at some food on the counter. No matter how much
      we &quot;Disney-ize&quot; these cute woodland creatures, it doesn't
      make them less wild. Just less leery of us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We haven't seen our neighborhood
      garbage bear for a couple of years, but we know he's there because
      every summer at least one neighbor forgets to properly handle
      their garbage and he decorates a nearby hillside.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Our current garbage bear apparently
      likes melons. One time he tipped over a trash can and that was
      all he ate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When we lived on Millar Street
      several years ago, the neighborhood garbage bear had a sweet
      tooth. You could leave your trash out all night and he wouldn't
      touch it. Unless you had thrown away cake or ice cream. He -
      or she - really loved ice cream.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I know this because I woke
      one night to a &quot;snorfing&quot; sound outside our house and
      peered out the window to see the bear on our back porch with
      a large ice cream container on its head. </FONT><TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But catching a bear on your
      porch usually means getting up around 3 a.m. Locals are more
      likely to drive out to Herring Cove just to watch the bears cavort
      in the water and chase the returning salmon. One time, we watched
      as a mother bear scooped two salmon out of the creek and plopped
      them down in front of her cubs on the bank. My wife called it
      a &quot;National Geographic&quot; moment.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Last week, we dropped by Power
      House Road to see if there were any bears about. We saw one wandering
      around the hatchery buildings but he was a long ways off. A dog
      barked but that didn't mean any thing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As we started to drive back
      across the Herring Cove bridge, we saw a mother bear and cub
      ambling up the hillside toward the spot where we had been standing
      a minute before. One of the neighborhood dogs was trying to turn
      itself into a bear snack but the mother bear was fortunately
      ignoring him.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">These are the sort of things
      that 800,000 people come to Ketchikan every year to see and to
      us they are often barely worth a second glance. Probably the
      same way that folks in New York City don't even notice when another
      pedestrian gets mugged.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of course, we do love our baby
      animals. A walk around Ward Lake or Bar Harbor is not complete
      unless mother ducks and ducklings are spotted. When they are
      we immediately violate the laws of nature &shy; and the wildlife
      wardens - by tossing whatever food we have in their direction.
      Sure, Doritos are probably not the best thing to be feeding baby
      mallards, but that doesn't stop us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And that feeding is - perhaps
      sadly - appreciated by the animals. I was at a birthday party
      at Ward Lake last week and I was noticing that the ducks were
      a little more skittish than usual and were generally keeping
      away from the beach while the party was going on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They kept their distance until
      &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; was being sung. Then I noticed them
      waddling rapidly up the beach toward the picnic shelter. I suspect
      they wanted cake, but they ended up with more Doritos instead.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pablov would have been pleased.<BR>
