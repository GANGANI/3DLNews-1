      Ketchikan, Alaska - The years immediately after World War II
      were lean ones in Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While the Depression had had
      less of an effect here than elsewhere in the country, the economic
      boost of the war years had artificially supported the local economy.
      With the end of the war, it became obvious that the dominant
      industry - the canned salmon industry - was in sharp decline
      and as the fishing industry waned so did Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When the canning industry boomed
      in the 1920s and early 1930s, Ketchikan had risen to a population
      of nearly 6,000 and for a time was a largest city in the state.
      But by the end of the war, the population had dropped back to
      down to 4,500 and there was no sign of any industry that would
      make up the jobs that were being lost each time a cannery closed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In order to boost the economy
      of Ketchikan and the rest of Alaska, the federal government looked
      toward the Tongass National Forest and the billions of board
      feet of timber that it contained.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ketchikan Pulp Mill
      Construction - 1953<BR>
      This photograph is from Weston Davis' Grandmother's collection.
      Davis said as far as his Grandmother knows, the photographer
      has passed away. His name was Alex Kamkoff, an engineer working
      on the pulp mill construction project. The photo was a gift (1953).</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      This was not the first time the federal government had tried
      to boost the local timber industry,</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;After 1920s surveys showed
      Alaska timber suitable for pulp and paper production, Deputy
      Forest Supervisor (later Territorial Governor) B. Frank Heintzleman
      began a 30 effort to establish a pulp industry in Southeast Alaska,&quot;
      June Allen wrote in her 1992 history of Ketchikan &quot;Spirit.&quot;
      &quot;The first mill built near Juneau in 1920 failed, and the
      first 50-year Forest Service contracts awarded in 1927 were canceled
      during the Great Depression. World War II further delayed wood
      pulp industry development.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1947, the federal government
      tried again as Congress passed and President Harry Truman signed
      the Tongass Timber Act, which was designed to attract investment
      by offering a guaranteed quantity of timber to those willing
      to invest in physical plants capable of processing the timber
      in southeast Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1948, the US Forest Service
      accepted a bid from Ketchikan Pulp and Paper Company ( jointly
      owned by Philadelphia-based American Viscose and Puget Sound
      Pulp and Timber) for a bid to operate a viscose-process pulp
      mill at Ward Cove. The rush was on.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1954, the mill was completed
      and KPC signed a 50 year contract for up to 8.25 billion board
      feet of timber to service the mill.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;In the agreement, KPC
      was granted harvest rights on fewer than a million acres of Tongass
      forest lands, mainly on parts of Prince of Wales and Revilla
      Islands,&quot; Allen wrote in 1992. Total Tongass National Forest
      acreage is just under 17 million acres.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Construction of the mill took
      nearly 1,000 workers many of whom moved to Ketchikan for the
      duration of the two year $54 million job. Housing was at a premium
      and local developers took advantage of a change in Federal law
      that offered economic incentives for large apartment complexes.</FONT></P>

      This historical photograph is from Weston Davis' Grandmother's
      collection. Alex Kamkoff was the photographer - he was an engineer
      working on the pulp mill construction project. <BR>
      The photo was a gift to Davis' Grandmother.</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The Ferris Court (now the Mary Frances) was built downtown and
      added 100 units. Ketchikan's tallest buildings (both 10 stories)
      were built on the West End. The Austin (now the Tongass Towers)
      had 124 units and the Wingren Court (now the Marine View) had
      121 units. Grocery store owner Paul Wingren helped finance the
      Wingren Court and his new larger Wingren's Grocery was built
      next to the bottom floor of the apartment building. Another grocery,
      the Log Cabin Grocery, was built adjacent to the Austin Towers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Other smaller apartment buildings
      such as the Louise (now the Deer Mountain Apartments) were also
      built during this time as were numerous private houses. The Carlanna
      neighborhood above Charcoal Point began to develop with smaller
      roads branching off Baranof.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The biggest local housing development
      in the early 1950s was originally called Tongass View and took
      in the heights above the new Ketchikan High School. Originally
      200 homes were planned for the Jackson Street neighborhood but
      only 45 built. Many of the KPC management employees had homes
      on Jackson Street, which was also called &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;
      for many years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It wasn't until the 1990s that
      most of the rest of the Tongass View subdivision was developed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Houses also quickly bloomed
      in the Heath Addition area, the old Heath homestead where First,
      Second, Third and Fourth avenues currently are.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The federal government also
      realized that low income housing would also be needed and built
      the Alder Park Public Housing project on Bryant Street which
      served 100 low income families for nearly three decades. It has
      since been replaced by the Ketchikan Pioneers Home and the Seaview
      Terrace senior housing development.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although many of the workers
      were single, some also brought their families and it was estimated
      that most of the permanent 500 mill workers would bring families
      in from Outside. New residents meant a great strain on local
      schools. A new Ketchikan High School was built on Fourth Avenue
      and opened in 1954, leaving the old high school downtown to become
      the Old Main Elementary School. White Cliff Elementary was also
      expanded in 1952 to a capacity of more than 500 students.</FONT></P>

      Local and Federal officials originally estimated that Ketchikan's
      population could reach 15,000 by 1960, but the reality was a
      little less &quot;booming&quot; than that.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Between 1950 and 1960, more
      than 1,000 new residents came to Ketchikan proper. Pushing the
      total to nearly 6,500. The population outside the city limits
      grew even more dramatically, from around 1,500 to nearly 3,500
      residents.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The rapidly increasing population
      also led Ketchikan to finally deal with some road infrastructure
      challenges that had been vexing locals for years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There had been plans as early
      as the 1920s to tunnel through the Knob Hill hillside that effectively
      blocked the Downtown area from the Newtown area. Although a wooden
      trestle had been built connecting the two areas as early 1902,
      the narrow trestle had to be enlarged several times as the community
      grew and automobiles replaced dray horses.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">With hundreds of thousands
      of federal highway improvement dollars flowing into the community,
      the 275 foot tunnel project got the go ahead and by 1954, Ketchikan
      had the only tunnel in America that one could drive through,
      around and over.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Other road projects also helped
      to spread the community out. North Tongass had been little more
      than bumpy, rutted one lane road from Ward Cove on out, but it
      was dramatically widened and much of it was paved. South Tongass
      was paved and widened all the way out to Herring Cove.</FONT></P>

      Spur roads such as D-1 Loop, Pond Reef and Roosevelt Drive also
      expanded off the main highways.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Industrial areas were also
      developed including the Peninsula Point sea plane base which
      had previously been a community picnic area between town and
      Ward Cove.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Development of Ketchikan's
      largest boat harbor, Bar Harbor, also began in the early 1950s.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Beyond the tunnel, Water Street
      was more than doubled in size and many of the buildings in the
      cramped Newtown neighborhood were either demolished or moved
      - some such as the Nordby and Northern Machine buildings were
      moved as far as 30 feet - to make room for the new road.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Farther out, Tongass Avenue
      was also widened from its single lane wooden trestle leading
      to the first real development of Ketchikan's West End, which
      had previously been considered the Charcoal Point neighborhood.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But as Ketchikan grew, the
      Downtown area also became more crowded. Part of that was an unintended
      consequence of the closing of the Creek Street Red Light District
      in 1953. Prostitution and other vice didn't go away, a lot of
      it moved into the numerous Downtown residential &quot;hotels&quot;
      which were also booming because of the high number of single
      construction and mill workers coming into the area.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As a result of the crowding
      Downtown Ketchikan saw some its most spectacular and infamous
      fires in the mid 1950s. One spectacular blaze took out several
      popular local haunts including the Bamboo Room, the Peter Pan
      and Hamburger Heaven - which earlier est a local record by selling
      more than 5,000 hamburgers in six weeks. That fire, along with
      several others, was later attributed to Ketchikan's home grown
      fire bug, Fire Lt. Bill Mitchell.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By the time the first bale
      of pulp left the new Ketchikan pulp mill on July 1, 1954, Ketchikan
      had been changed irrevocably.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A new economic engine had fired
      up and the era of year round jobs had finally reached Alaska's
      First City. Gone was the half-century local economy in which
      all activity took place in the summer and everyone operated on
      credit through the long winter.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In subsequent years, state
      officials would consider Ketchikan as having one of the most
      diverse economies in the state. Local officials would proudly
      point at the three-legged stool of timber, fishing and tourism
      (in addition to being the service area for the expanding outlying
      areas).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That all began in the mid 1950s
      and lasted for more than 40 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Editor's Note: The Tongass
      Historical Museum is currently running an exhibit of photographs
      from the mid 1950s by Paalu Saari entitled &quot;Boom Town, Ketchikan
      in the 1950s.&quot; The exhibit will be showing until April 16th.</FONT></P>
