      <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Alaska is a state of superlatives.
      It is the nation's largest state. We drive past or fly over&nbsp;
      America's highest mountain. We can visit the nation's deepest
      cave on Prince of Wales Island, admire the waters of our state's
      longest coastline and enjoy the&nbsp; midnight sun's longest
      days. Most of us, however, will never see our superlative example
      of the Alaska State Gem - jade. That's because Jade Mountain,
      an entire mountain made of beautiful dark green jade, is far
      from any Alaska road system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are no highways that
      reach into the far northwest region of Alaska's arctic. Even
      air travel is restricted to small planes. There are few visitors
      to the little Eskimo villages along the Kobuk River, a sizeable
      stream that winds its way along a 200-mile route from its headwaters
      in the Brooks Range to Kotzebue Sound and the Chukchi Sea.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Northwest Alaska -
      the Kobuk River is just above the Arctic Circle.</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The river keeps well above the Arctic Circle en route. It rolls
      through a landscape of birch, spruce, poplar and willow and then
      courses through rolling tundra as it nears its ocean destination.
      The Kobuk is busy with local boat and barge traffic in the short
      ice-free summer months and with snow machines in the winter.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There are no contemporary hiking
      trails or campgrounds along the river's route, but there are
      small Eskimo villages - Kobuk, Shungnak, Ambler and finally Kiana,
      the closest to the river's estuary. But this remote Kobuk Valley
      has been home to people for perhaps 12,000 years! - the date
      established by carbon dating of artifacts left behind by its
      ancient inhabitants. Anthropologists are said to agree on that
      date as being close to the time the North American continent
      was first inhabited by man.</FONT><TABLE WIDTH="187" ALIGN="LEFT"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The oldest house pits were
      excavated about midway on the Kobuk at the site of a natural
      portage. They reveal that ancient man had camped here for generation
      after generation. Great herds of caribou thundered across the
      river at this crossing during their annual southbound migrations
      all those thousands of years ago as the animals still do today.
      Those early hunters left behind evidence of their cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And in Alaska that earliest
      man was an Eskimo. Eskimos are, by definition, people of the
      sea - subsisting on seals, whales and other creatures of the
      icy oceans. But some of these early, and some present Kobuk River
      inhabitants of Alaska required another definition, because they
      had chosen to expand their cultural choices and had migrated
      inland, perhaps seasonally, to take advantage not only of the
      bounty of the ocean but of the woodlands that provided caribou
      and other game as well. The antecedents of these woodland Eskimos
      were chosen as subjects of study.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Beginning in the late 1930s,
      the University of Alaska in Fairbanks found the funding to send
      its own as well as visiting anthropologists to explore and document
      findings in the Territory's unexplored vastness. Some of them
      chose to target the Kobuk River &shy; not even mapped at the
      time - because of its unexplored remoteness and its unique woodland
      Eskimo</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They were intrigued by&nbsp;
      stories of a legendary mountain of jade. They had in earlier
      times heard tales of Gold Rush miners elsewhere in the wilds
      of Alaska unearthing tusks of woolly mammoths - even those of
      mastodons. There had been skepticism, but the tales turned out
      to be true.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The mountain of jade also was
      true! It is one of the westernmost&nbsp; peaks in the Brooks
      Range, and it is aptly named Jade Mountain - an entire mountain
      of jade! It is said to be about 150 miles east of Kotzebue, the
      closest large town. No one person &quot;discovered&quot; the
      mountain - it had always been there, but the university's scientists
      documented it. They also recorded a number of legends connected
      with the amazing mountain.</FONT><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"

            <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A unique feature of
            the Washington Monument is the 193 memorial stones that adorn
            the east and west interior walls of the monument. The State of
            Alaska stone is located at the 450-foot level on the West Wall
            of the Washington Monument. It is of Green Jade from Jade Mountain
            in Alaska. It was inserted into the wall on February 22, 1982.

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One of the legends, called
      The Jade House, tells the story of a poor little boy who visits
      the home of a neighboring <I>umelik</I>, a rich man. He arrived
      at dinnertime, but the son of the rich man threw food in the
      poor boy's face. So the poor boy leaves and later meets the son
      of an old woman who gives them two magical chin bones so they
      can fly. They fly to the rich man's house and with their magic
      powers make his house lean sideways. They ask the rich man for
      much jade to build a house with, and the <I>umelik</I> agrees
      if only they will make his fine house stand upright again. They
      do so and then, using the chin bones, the boys fly themselves
      and all their jade home again. They are tired from the effort,
      and while they sleep, the old woman makes them a nice mountaintop
      house from the jade.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The boys awake and see a big
      house made all of jade! The tale continues,&nbsp; &quot;You can
      see through the house like a window everything is in the cabin
      &shy; something to eat, something to wear. The boys are <I>umeliks</I>
      now. And after awhile they are living there, and those other
      people are getting kind of hungry over there at Jade Mountain.
      They have no grub in that village. They have a hard time.&quot;
      But the little boy who had food thrown in his face doesn't give
      them anything to eat. The old story is true, the teller of the
      legend said, because some tumbled pieces of jade have been found
      on top of Oksik Mountain, and it's believed to be part of the
      old jade house the old woman built for the boys. (This story
      was transcribed by anthropologist J.L. Giddings in his book &quot;Kobuk
      River People.&quot;)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Today the presence of Alaska's
      dark green jade, the gem the Chinese call the Stone of Heaven,
      is well known. At the signing of Alaska's Constitution by delegates
      in 1956, the ceremony was lighted by a jade lamp adorned with
      gold and silver trim. It was provided for the occasion by the
      Delegate Marvin &quot;Muktuk&quot; Marston - organizer of the
      World War II Eskimo Scouts who served so proudly during the frightening
      years of the Alaska theater of war. Then in 1968, the Alaska
      Legislature named jade as its official State Gem. Specimens are
      on display all over the state.</FONT><TABLE ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Residents and tourists always
      notice the huge chunk of Alaska jade on display at the entrance
      to Anchorage's downtown Visitors Bureau on Fourth Avenue. The
      most notable piece of Alaska jade in the nation's capital is
      embedded in the interior wall of the Washington Monument, the
      jade a gift from Alaska in 1982. In Fairbanks this year, a 3,600-pound
      block of jade from the Kobuk was donated by the NANA Native Corporation
      to the Fairbanks Police Department. It was erected as part of
      a memorial to police officers killed in the line of duty. Among
      the flowerbeds of the manicured grounds of the U of A&nbsp; Fairbanks
      campus is a jade memorial to the late Kathryn Patty, the gardening
      wife of early U of A President Ernest Patty.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There is modern &quot;legend&quot;
      dating back to the 1950s that a large block of jade was ordered
      by Argentina to be used as a memorial to Evita Peron. The story
      goes that the heavy gemstone was delivered to the Fairbanks,
      was loaded onto an Alaska Railroad car and carried to the railroad's
      southern terminus at Seward. However, the story continues, by
      that time whoever ordered the gemstone had canceled the order
      because of continuing political upheaval in Argentina - and the
      jade was shipped back to Fairbanks. No confirmation of that tale
      has yet been found.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And of course Alaska's thousands
      of summer tourists leave homeward bound with jewelry and trinkets
      made of Alaska jade from that remote valley in the Arctic. And
      ancient man, too, picked up nuggets of jade that tumbled downstream
      in the spring freshets of the Kobuk River. He used the jade for
      tools and weapons and perhaps for pretty trinkets And some of
      those artifacts he left&nbsp; behind in house pits, to be found
      by modern man.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As anthropologists in the 1940s
      through the 1960s trekked across the Kobuk tundra and the woodlands
      farther inland and canoed down the Kobuk River, they stopped
      en route to dig at a site downriver from Jade Mountain. It was
      called Onion Portage, a place where wild onions grew in profusion
      and caribou herds were said to have crossed the river during
      their annual migrations from a time &quot;before man's memory.&quot;
      It seemed a logical place to look for evidence of layers of human
      habitation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And the evidence was there.
      Visiting anthropologist Louis Giddings of Brown University made
      a surface investigation of the house pits at Onion Portage before
      World War II but it wasn't until the 1960s that he began to work
      the site in earnest. By 1963 there was a large crew of scientists
      and helpers working at the site, carefully uncovering layer after
      layer of habitation and collecting the artifacts of each layer's
      exposure. Onion Portage was, and may still be, the oldest human
      campsite in Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In one of Giddings' several
      books he also tells of finds at Cape Krusenstern, now a National
      Monument on the Arctic Ocean coast just north of Kotzebue. This
      is a huge, empty and remarkable site of ancient populations far
      larger than thought possible in an&nbsp; Arctic environment,
      and of curious cultural customs. One site was found in which
      the ancient skeletons were found with ivory &quot;spinal columns&quot;
      holding the vertebra together, and with eye sockets filled with
      ivory eyeballs! Who were these people? Was there any truth in
      Eskimo tales of ancient giants?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Giddings was killed in a car
      wreck just a year after his remarkable dig at Onion Portage.
      But Giddings' books leave readers waiting for the other shoe
      to drop! Where did these ancient Eskimos originate? Perhaps there
      are later books or papers by subsequent field scientists working
      in Alaska? Does the University of Alaska have such works available?
      Is working in the anthropological field still going on, by the
      U of A, perhaps by the National Park Service? Is there a list
      of recommended reading for interested Alaskans?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There is no place in the world
      that can equal Alaska, not only in size and splendor but in unanswered
      questions.</FONT></P>
