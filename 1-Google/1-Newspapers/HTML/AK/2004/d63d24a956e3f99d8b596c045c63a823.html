      <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ketchikan, Alaska - It's fun to
      see Ketchikan residents promenading back and forth along the
      newly opened Third Avenue Bypass (AKA  5 Minutes Quicker to Liam's
      Daycare! ). Having fresh pavement to pound always brings out
      the good cheer amongst our landlocked bretheren.</FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Whether or not you think it
      was a good idea to spend nearly $28 million dollars to build
      a mile of road, it's fair to note that Ketchikan residents have
      been trying to bypass our fair city ever since Ketchikan was
      born. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From the minute the board walks
      began snaking north and south of Mike Martin's store  over a
      century ago, we started seeking ways around them because - let's
      face it - our little  30 miles long, four blocks wide town has
      always had access issues. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We have always been trapped
      between the waterfront (can't block off that economic lifeline)
      and the hillsides (not enough dynamite in the world to make Ketchikan
      a traditional grid community). We especially looked lustfully
      at Juneau's Glacier Highway and Egan Expressway and thought &quot;Dang
      it, we need to come up with a way to get to the airport ferry
      two minutes quicker!&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So we've hatched quite a few
      schemes to help us get around the bottlenecks that ensue when
      you have 10,000 residents and 15,000 cars on what used to be
      the busiest two-lane road in America. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At one point Hopkins Alley-Upper
      Water Street was supposed to be all the bypass that Ketchikan
      would need. That was why the wooden viaduct was widened in the
      early years, wiping out the yards of all those grumpy sea captains.
      But then the automobile numbers continued to rise and when you
      added in on-street parking the Water Street bypass became just
      another clogged artery. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the west end developed,
      roads through the Heath Addition and the Carlanna area served
      as neo-bypasses, but if you ve got to drive up steep hills, then
      come back down to the traffic jam you just left, you haven't
      gained much. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Even more interesting was the
      long planned yet never implemented secondary bypass that began
      somewhere north of Mountain Point and ended somewhere south of
      Point Higgins. It snaked along bench lands and around cliff sides,
      always a vague dotted line on all the city and borough development
      maps. Part of it even got as far as being named Delmar Shull
      Drive in the area above the West End. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Third Avenue Bypass is
      part of the that secondary bypass and it does bypass the southern
      part of the West End and empty out into the northern part of
      the West End. But it does little to deal with the real downtown
      bottleneck, unless you think that Schoenbar Road to Park Avenue
      to Fair Street to Deermont Street to Stedman Street is really
      a quick bypass (takes an hour if you get behind the horse trolley!).
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Schoenbar bypass road -
      which doubles as an Olympic regulation 90-meter ski jump in the
      winter - actually does function as a downtown bypass as long
      as it isn't clogged by snow, rain or suicidal skateboarders.
      But once again you have to go up Bawden to Pine to Forest just
      to reach the top of the ski jump. And if you really want to miss
      the downtown congestion the route is Deermont to Fair to Park
      to Schoenbar and then the ski jump but at least the horse trolley
      is going the other direction. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If the bridge to the Pennock
      and Gravina (see hardlink below) is built then you will see a
      real scramble to come up with some sort of  beltway that bypasses
      downtown altogether, otherwise a 5 minute ferry ride is going
      to be replaced by a two hour mini Santa Ana Freeway snarl as
      folks contend with the Downtown traffic gridlock.  I can envision
      something involving a pontoon bridge over Ketchikan Lake and
      maybe a car-carrying funicular up one side of Deer Mountain and
      down the other into Saxman but then I always was a bit of a dreamer.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Not all the bypassing involves
      cars. The idea of pedestrian overpasses for Front Street comes
      up time and again as the summer pedestrian flows continues to
      build and spill over onto the state highway. Unfortunately, every
      time overpasses are studied the conclusion is the same, unless
      you force people to use them, they won t. So much for the so-called
      &quot;Foc sle - Sourdough Hardlink&quot;. It has been suggested
      that the only way to force overpass usage would be increase the
      speed limit on Front Street to 55 mph and eliminate the crosswalks.
      It is an idea whose time may have come. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Speaking of Hardlink, the most
      spectacular dreaming comes out when we talk about a Hard Link
      to Gravina Island and our &quot;inaccessible&quot; airport. We
      ponder bridges, tunnels, increased ferry service, catapults...just
      about anything that would make it easier to get across Tongass
      Narrows in plenty of time to have a good long wait in the TSA
      lines. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Years ago, my great good friend
      Pete Figueroa came up with the idea of getting a moth-balled
      aircraft carrier and sticking it sideways across the channel.
      In addition to a hard-link you'd have plenty of temporary housing
      for summer workers and space for an aquarium in the basement.
      I suppose you could even use the deck for the occasional take
      off and if it was nuclear-powered you'd never need to build another
      hydro or electrical intertie again. Strap some modern bow thrusters
      on it and you could turn to allow the cruise ships to pass through.
      It's worth giving the folks in Bremerton a call. There can't
      be that big a market in mothballed warships. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another option that simply
      hasn't received enough study is creating access by simply filling
      in Tongass Narrows. Sure, the federal and state permitting process
      would be awful, but it's already so bad on much smaller projects
      it can't be even remotely proportionally worse on something like
      making Gravina a peninsula of Revillagigedo. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Imagine being able to walk
      or take a very short drive to the airport. We could use the millions
      set aside for the bridge to build a brand new port facility wherever
      the filling in stopped, say Pennock, or at the worst, Nichols
      Passage. We wouldn't even be talking about  revitalizing  vast
      chunks of our &quot;quaint&quot; waterfront to create new docks.
      The cruise lines would love it because we know how economically
      pleasant it is for them to put passengers on expensive bus rides,
      even if they are only short rides into town. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Where would the fill come from
      you say? Well, even though I did say earlier that there probably
      wouldn't be enough dynamite available to totally flatten the
      mountains behind town, there is enough worldwide to get a start
      on it. Over the years, I've watched the local blasting engineers
      do remarkable feats of earth moving - frequently farther then
      they had planned. Imagine the fun if you just told them to &quot;let
       er rip&quot;. We could even help fund it with a lottery on how
      far some of the chunks would go.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I'd be willing to bet that
      a least a few of the rocks would bypass Gravina altogether. <BR>
