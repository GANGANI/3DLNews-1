      <P><BR>
      <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Thank you Shauna Lee!!! I live
      right below the bypass wall, and I am the recipient of all the
      trash people throw over. There would be a lot more trash to see
      but I have been picking it up for over a month since the road
      opened. I am keeping it in a bag to deliver to someone in charge.</FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So far no one wants to take
      responsibility for designing a road like this without a chain-link
      fence that curves in at the top like the ones used on freeway
      overpasses down south. Before the road was even constructed I
      wrote to the state twice about my concerns about the trash that
      was going to come raining down on my home. Every night punks
      and hicks, and other trash bugs are pelting my cars and house
      with rocks chunks of rebar and other objects. So far my truck
      is the main object. It was hit twice with chunks of rebar. I
      chased and caught up with the culprits and warned them. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Punks walking along go to the
      other side of the road for ammo (rocks) then start throwing them
      at my home. I have collected McDonalds, Taco Time, coffee cups,
      Wal-mart bags, pop cans, beer cans, energy drink containers and
      on and on. I told the state in my letter that it will turn into
      another Water Street or Dunton Street. All one has to do is look
      below them and see the carnage. There are even shopping carts
      hurled overboard. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I watched the other day as
      kids dangled over the side in a dare!! And a month ago a mother
      had her toddler standing on top of the foolish unsafe and probably
      illegal handrail. I yelled at her and she moved on. I have spoken
      to the people in charge and they tell me that the reason there
      is no chain-link fence is that the designers want people to have
      a view, come on! You can see through a chain-link fence just
      fine, the whole purpose of the road is to get from point a to
      point b not to have traffic impeded by lookey-loos snapping photos.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Right now there are responsible
      people who work for the state that wanted and still want a chain-link
      fence, the ones who don't are the road's chief designer who says
      no way and city works director Harvey Hansen.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Will it take a tragedy before
      it is put up? I am keeping a journal of all the incidents and
      keeping bags of all the trash. I will not be putting up with
      all this forever, if you lived below the wall you would feel
      the same!   Some one do something!!!   </FONT></P>
