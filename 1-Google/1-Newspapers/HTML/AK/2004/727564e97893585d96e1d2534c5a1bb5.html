      Ketchikan, Alaska - I'm one of those weird persons who like buttermilk.
      I acquired a taste for it in Fifth Grade. As a class project,
      we took whole milk that had not been homogenized - I assume it
      was pasteurized - put it in a butter churn and all took turns
      mixing it until we ended up with buttermilk and butter. We ate
      the butter with Saltine crackers and drank the buttermilk in
      little paper cups. It was delicious.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Today, as I reached into the
      refrigerator for that quart of buttermilk I bought two weeks
      ago, I asked myself, &quot;How can you tell if buttermilk has
      gone bad?&quot; I thought, &quot;Does it really matter? It already
      tastes like sour milk.&quot; You know something? I'm beginning
      to feel the same way about the upcoming election.</FONT></P>

      Osama bin Laden has declared war on the United States. He has
      vowed to continue attacking us because he wants to destroy us.
      I don't recall bin Laden putting any conditions on that vow,
      such as, &quot;I will continue trying to destroy you unless John
      Kerry is elected President.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Palestinians want to destroy
      Israel. They've wanted to wipe Israel off the face of the map
      ever since the British left Palestine and the Israelis took the
      land by force. There have been five Democrat and six Republican
      Presidents in office over that period and the Palestinians still
      sing the same tune. What difference would it make if Kerry or
      Bush is President?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Both Bush and Kerry have pet
      programs they want to push through Congress during the next four
      years. The operative term here is &quot;push through Congress.&quot;
      All of these programs require money. The President can't spend
      a dime unless Congress approves the expenditure. All this debating
      about creating jobs or losing jobs, raising taxes or lowering
      taxes, gay marriages or gay unions is moot. Neither Bush nor
      Kerry can accomplish anything without Congressional approval.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If Kerry is elected, he will
      have to deal with a Legislative Branch controlled by Republicans.
      Do you think they might be a little upset if Bush loses? Do you
      think John Kerry has a snowball's chance in Hell of getting his
      programs approved by that Congress? If Bush is re-elected, he'll
      run into the same problem because the Democratic minority will
      filibuster anything he supports. Look at how they've managed
      to hold up his judicial appointments for the past four years.
      Will Kerry fair any better trying to appoint liberal judges?
      I think not.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nope, it really doesn't matter
      who is President. Terrorists will still be terrorists, and Congress
      will still be Congress. The important thing is America will still
      be America, and no President, liberal or conservative, can change
      that.<BR>
