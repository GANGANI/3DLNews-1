      About 130 soldiers of A Company, Third Battalion (Scout), 297th
      Infantry of the 207th Infantry Group (Scout) headquartered in
      Juneau were activated by the call. Their activation is expected
      to last up to 18 months.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to information provided
      by Sgt. Keefe Blankenship of the 297th Battalion in Ketchikan,
      the 297th has been notified they have been activated. The 297th
      is attached to Juneau's 207th Infantry.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sgt. Blankenship said there
      are 9 Ketchikan troops plus one guardsman from Metlakatla who
      are being called to active duty. He declined to name the local
      troops with orders to report.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To assist the troops and their
      families, Sgt. Blankenship said a Family Ready Awareness will
      be held in Juneau on September 24th-26. He said this conference
      is scheduled to help the troops and their families understand
      what deployment involves and what they can expect. Sgt. Blankenship
      said there will also be a separate session for children ages
      6-14.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Blankenship said the Army National
      Guard will be offering paid airline tickets to Juneau as well
      as accommodations for the spouses and children. He said that
      along with the troops stationed in Ketchikan, troops &amp; their
      families from Sitka, Wrangell and Petersburg will be attending
      the conference.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sgt. Blankenship said all Southeast
      Alaska Army National Guard troops have been ordered to be in
      Anchorage on October 1, 2004. At that time he said the troops
      will be given medicals to assure they are physically fit for
      overseas deployment.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A Company, Third Battalion
      has elements located throughout Southeast and Southcentral Alaska.
      The unit will gather at Fort Richardson for its pre-mobilization
      station before departing to their duty assignments. The unit
      will be assigned to blend with units from Hawaii that are bound
      for Iraq according to the Office of the Governor.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The President has asked
      and I've concurred with the involuntary call-up of a portion
      of our Alaska Army National Guard troops for duty in the global
      war on terror. We're extremely proud of their selfless service
      in our communities, throughout our state, and now to America,
      in this time of need,&quot; Governor Frank Murkowski said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;These are our families,
      our neighbors, our friends. They go forward with our thoughts
      and prayers and with the knowledge that Alaskans across our state
      await their safe return,&quot; said the governor.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to information provided
      COL Marc Williams of the Alaska National Guard, Ketchikan resident
      and Guardsman 2LT Bryan Perez was earlier deployed to Operation
      Iraqi Freedom. COL Williams said, &quot;LT Perez is a proud Alaska
      Army National Guardsman who volunteered to assist the 30th Armor
      Brigade in Iraq as an Infantry platoon leader. Ketchikan should
      be exceptionally proud of this young patriot.&quot;<BR>
