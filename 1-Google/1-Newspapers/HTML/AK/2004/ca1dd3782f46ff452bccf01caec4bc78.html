      Yakutat, Alaska - Hubbard Glacier is on the move and Forest Service
      officials are concerned it could once again block the entrance
      to Russell Fiord, near Yakutat, if it continues progressing at
      its current rate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Hubbard has been advancing
      for the past few months and is currently about 640 feet from
      closing off Gilbert Point,&quot; said Yakutat District Ranger
      Tricia O'Connor. &quot;It has advanced about 1000 feet in the
      past two to three months.&quot;</FONT></P>

      In 1986 and 2002, Hubbard Glacier closed the entrance to Russell
      Fiord, blocking the flow of the fiord into Disenchantment Bay.
      The water level in the newly formed Russell Lake rose to 83 feet
      above sea level in 1986 and 61 feet in 2002. Both times, the
      ice and moraine dam broke.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Although the situation
      is currently not life threatening we are very concerned for the
      residents and economic health of Yakutat,&quot; said O'Connor.
      &quot;If the lake level rises to 135 feet, the fiord would drain
      southward into the Situk River drainage, affecting this important
      fishery and flooding national forest and private land. The economy
      of Yakutat could be affected because the Situk River is the main
      sport, commercial and subsistence fishery in this community.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the lead land management
      agency, the Forest Service has invested a substantial amount
      of money and effort in studying and monitoring Hubbard Glacier
      for nearly 20 years and has re-intensified its efforts since
      the 2002 closure.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Forest Service has been
      working hand in hand with the Glacier Institute-University Alaska
      Fairbanks, U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service,
      to better understand the 1986 and 2002 closures. The work includes
      bathymetry data collection in the Gilbert Point area and continued
      monitoring and study of the activity of the glacier.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Forest Service funded and
      developed more accurate topographic models of the south end of
      Russell Fiord and the potential floodplain in the Situk watershed
      using advanced laser technology, called LIDAR.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;LIDAR technology offers
      the most accurate, expedient, and cost-effective way to capture
      wide area elevation information,&quot; said Bob Gubernick, engineering
      geologist and lead fish passage engineer for the Tongass National
      Forest.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Other work the Forest Service
      has accomplished in partnership with many other federal and state
      agencies includes calculating water inflow and modeling potential
      outflow rates in Russell Fiord and Lake; using ground penetrating
      radar to assess the stability of the moraine at the potential
      spill-over notch; predicting and modeling the floodplain of the
      &quot;new&quot; Situk River; installing a stream gauge in the
      Old Situk River, to substantiate the assumed lack of a groundwater
      connection to Russell Lake, gather habitat data, and much more.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The Forest Service, along
      with numerous other agencies, is committed to try our best to
      understand all of the potential effects of this event in order
      to ensure public safety and health and to work with the community
      to prepare for this event,&quot; said O'Connor. &quot;There is
      a tremendous amount of money and effort involved in trying to
      get a grasp on this incredible force of nature so we can better
      educate and inform the public about its behavior. And, of course,
      while we are doing our best to understand what will happen, we
      can't model or predict everything with 100 percent certainty.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The U. S. Army Corp of Engineers
      also is working closely with the Forest Service and other agencies
      to conduct a reconnaissance report to investigate the feasibility
      of mitigation to reduce the impacts of the overflow event from
      affecting the Situk River.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Glaciologists from U.S. Geological
      Survey and University of Alaska predict that eventually, a stable
      ice dam will form and could block the entrance into Russell Fiord
      for many years. However, according to glaciologists, it also
      is possible that Hubbard Glacier may continue this cycle of blockage
      and dam breakage before it forms a stable dam.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the glacier continues its
      advance, the Forest Service will provide regular updates to keep
      the public informed. The Tongass National Forest has established
      a link to information about Hubbard Glacier on its website at
      <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/">www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/</A></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hubbard Glacier, the largest
      calving tidewater glacier in North America, originates in Canada,
      flows through Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and ends in the
      northwest corner of the Yakutat Ranger District.</FONT></P>
