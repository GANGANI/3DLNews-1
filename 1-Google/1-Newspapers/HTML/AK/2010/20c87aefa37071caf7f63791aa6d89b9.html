      Ketchikan, Alaska - It can be argued that the first &quot;tourist&quot;
      to visit Alaska was the man who was most responsible for the
      purchase of the territory, U.S. Secretary of State William H.
      Seward.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although many people had come
      to Alaska both before and after the 1867 purchase, nearly all
      had visited either for economic or scientific reasons. Few if
      any, had come simply to &quot;see the elephant&quot; to use a
      term popular with the few 19th century people wealthy enough
      to &quot;travel.&quot; </FONT><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Seward had retired from government
      service on March 5, 1869. Although he was nearly 70 and in generally
      poor health, he decided he wanted to spend his remaining years
      traveling and first on his list was a visit to the land that
      he had purchased for the United States in 1867. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;His friends were surprised
      and politely hinted that he could not endure the fatigue of a
      long journey,&quot; Frederic Bancroft wrote in his 1967 book:
      &quot;The Life of William H. Seward.&quot;  &quot;Although physically
      a broken down old man, who could not get along without a valet,
      he seemed to be as unwilling as ever to recognize that anything
      was impossible for him.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In June of 1869, Seward started
      his journey to Alaska with a railroad trip across the country
      on then barely one-month-old transcontinental railroad. He saw
      buffalo and Indian camps and had a lengthy visit with Brigham
      Young in Salt Lake City. He then visited Sacramento and San Francisco.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Prominent Californian businessman
      Ben Holladay - the so-called Stagecoach King - arranged for Seward
      and his party to use one of his ships, the Active, for his voyage
      north.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Some California friends
      were invited to join the original party and the Active started
      about the middle of July to visit 'Seward's Arctic Province,&quot;
      Bancroft wrote.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The ship visited Seattle and
      Victoria B.C. and then arrived in Sitka near the end of July.
      It was there that Seward became involved &shy; informally &shy;
      in negotiations with the Chilkat Indians. General Jefferson C.
      Davis (no relation to the imprisoned former head of the Confederacy,
      Jefferson F. Davis) had had &quot;trouble&quot; with the Chilkats,
      who now wanted to make peace, according to Bancroft.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Davis and his party, joined
      Seward and his crew to visit the Chilkats up Lynn Canal. By coincidence,
      there was a US government survey team also in the area to view
      a rare total eclipse of the sun. According to Bancroft, the party
      timed its visit with the Chilkats to coincide with the eclipse.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;When the shadow began
      to pass over the sun the Indians thought that it was caused by
      the instruments used by the 'Boston Men' as the (visitors) were
      called,&quot; Bancroft wrote. &quot;Some of the Chilkats became
      greatly alarmed by the darkness and fell on their knees and prayed.
      When the shadow passed off they were relieved and thought the
      &quot;Boston Men&quot; were more wonderful than ever.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Unfortunately, Bancroft wrote, the Chilkats mistook Seward as
      the &quot;Great Tyee&quot; or supreme ruler of the Boston Men
      and demanded that he force the Sitka Indians to kill nine of
      their tribal members to atone for the deaths they had caused
      of three members of the Chilkat chief's family earlier. Seward
      ascertained that the killings had taken place when the Russians
      still controlled Alaska so he convinced the Chilkats to instead
      accept 36 blankets from Sitka.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When Seward and his party returned
      to Sitka in early August, he gave a public address on the wonders
      of Alaska that he had seen.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The written text of the 14-paged,
      single-spaced speech is in the Alaska State Archives.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">First, he noted that he had
      only seen a small part of the state and yet he had covered an
      area equivalent to making a trip from New England to Memphis.
      Next, he remarked on the climate which was far from the &quot;ice
      box&quot; of the detractors of the Alaska purchase.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The weather of this one
      broad climate of Alaska is severely criticized in outside circles
      for being too wet and too cold,&quot; Seward said. &quot;Nevertheless
      it must be a fastidious person who complains of climates in which
      the eagle delights to soar and the hummingbird does not disdain
      to flutter. It (also) must be confessed at least that it is an
      honest climate, for it makes no pretensions to constancy.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He goes on to say that it is
      impossible to exaggerate Alaska's physical treasures such as
      its rivers and its wildlife and notes that its untapped mineral
      and forest resources will make Alaska a &quot;shipyard for the
      supply of all nations.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Seward also briefly touched
      on Alaska's potential as a full member of the United States of
      America. &quot;Nor do I doubt that the political society constituted
      here, first as a Territory, and ultimately as a State or many
      States, with prove a worthy constituency of the Republic,&quot;
      he concluded, therefore firing the first salvo in the Alaska
      statehood battle that would last the next 90 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After leaving Sitka, Seward
      sailed south and stopped at Fort Tongass, the American military
      post near the Canadian border, some 60 miles south of the current
      location of Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      It was here that local Natives gave him a potlatch and he famously
      did not reciprocate, which led to the creation of a &quot;shame&quot;
      totem pole and a controversy that exists to this day in which
      local Native leaders contend that the US government or Seward's
      descendents still need to reciprocate the potlatch.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bancroft's &quot;Life of William
      H. Seward&quot; skips the incident entirely, but as recently
      as March 15, 2009 Daniel Gibson briefly noted the ongoing controversy
      in Native Peoples Magazine, reporting that Tlingit chief Ebbit
      originally raised a totem pole in Seward's honor but then later
      had the visitors ears and nose painted red as a sign of shame
      when Seward failed to reciprocate the gifts he had been given.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After Seward's visit there
      was a steady trickle of visitors, including naturalist John Muir,
      who first visited Alaska in 1879, and wrote a bestselling book,
      Travels in Alaska, in 1879.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;To the lover of pure
      wildness Alaska is one of the most wonderful countries in the
      world,&quot; Muir wrote. &quot;No excursion that I know of may
      be made into any other American wilderness where so marvelous
      an abundance of noble, newborn scenery is so charmingly brought
      to view as on the trip through the Alexander Archipelago to Fort
      Wrangell and Sitka.&quot;</FONT></P>

      That same year, 1879, missionary Sheldon Jackson brought a group
      of Presbyterian Church officials north on a &quot;sightseeing&quot;
      trip to view both the progress of his mission and the wonders
      of the Great Land, according to a 2007 publication of the Alaska
      State Museum written by June Hall, &quot;The Lure of Alaska:
      A History of Tourism in the Great Land.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By the early 1880s, steamships
      were making regular voyages to Alaska, and along with the miners,
      fishermen and other settlers, were tourists. Ships going north
      could be boarded in San Francisco, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Seattle
      and Victoria. Rail lines advertised trips that included visiting
      Yellowstone National Park by rail and Alaska via steamship. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The natural wonders of Alaska
      were the selling point: The mountains, the glaciers, the wildlife.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But among the natural wonders
      that visitors saw on their voyages was one spectacular decidedly
      man-made one.  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Starting in the early 1880s,
      the Treadwell mine in Douglas, across Gastineau Channel from
      Juneau, was the largest gold mine in the world and was visited
      by the steamships.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In her 2010 history of the
      mine, &quot;Treadwell Gold,&quot; Sheila Kelly opens her story
      with a visit to the mine by dozens of gawking tourists on an
      early steamship.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The visitors were treated to
      industrial power at its height with 300 stamps operating 24 hours
      a day - with noise that was first heard by the visitors when
      they were still eight miles away from the dock - and the 500
      foot deep &quot;Glory Hole&quot; growing at the edge of the channel.
      It was a dramatic counterpoint to the unbridled wilderness that
      most of the visitors were expecting on the tour.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The tourists went away
      impressed by the scale of the mine operations,&quot; Kelly wrote.
      &quot;They were amazed at the town's cultural life, charmed by
      the precocious youngsters and glad to be away from the incessant
      noise.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One of the first organized
      tours in Alaska was in the summer of 1878 when Captain George
      S. Wright escorted a group up the Stikine River from Fort Wrangel,
      according to historian Frank Norris' 1985 book &quot;Gawking
      at the Midnight Sun.&quot;</FONT></P>

      The Pacific Coast Steamship Company began monthly sailings through
      the Panhandle in 1881, but regularly scheduled service wouldn't
      begin until 1884. The average cost per two week trip was $78,
      but as passenger numbers rose the cost had dropped to $52 by
      1895, still the equivalent of $1,081 in 2005 dollars.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;In 1881, Victoria's newspaper,
      The British Colonist&quot; reported that &quot;tourists on board
      the (steamer) Los Angeles ascended a glacier at Harrisburg (most
      likely Juneau's Mendenhall Glacier) after which the steamer went
      on to Chilkat,&quot; June Hall wrote in 2007. &quot;They were
      delighted with the trip. That same summer the first region wide
      commercial tour took place. Henry Villard escorted General Nelson
      A.  Miles, Commander of the Department of the Columbia, a military
      band and an excursion part of 80 northward.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There was also great excitement
      in the communities that the steamships visited, according to
      Hall. She noted the excitement in an 1889 issue of the Sitka
      newspaper, The Alaskan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Steamboats! Steamboats!
      Steamboats! Boys yelling, Indians whooping, businessmen here
      and there, excited crowds rushing towards the wharf, the whole
      town in a furore of excitement and waiting with impatience for
      the lines of the steamboat to be cast ashore, the ship made fast
      to the wharf. Thus it is on Steamboat Day.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">With the Pacific Coast Steamship
      Company dominating most of the industry, there was a generally
      set pattern to the excursions in the 1880s and 1890s, according
      to Frank Norris.</FONT></P>

      Most of the steamers left San Francisco and made intermediate
      stops in Seattle, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Victoria or Vancouver.
      Frequently, the first Alaskan stop was at the tiny village of
      Mary Island, about 35 miles south of modern day Ketchikan. Mary
      Island was the official customs station for entry into Alaska
      from south. In the 1890s, the federal government decided to relocate
      the customs operation to a larger community and that started
      off a &quot;war&quot; between the villages of Ketchikan and Loring.
      Ketchikan won and Loring -  the larger community - faded into
      history.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After the cursory customs stop
      at Mary Island, the ships steamed north to Fort Wrangel which
      had been both a Russian and English community since 1834. Norris
      noted that visitors disembarked in the town to learn its history,
      see the totem poles and community house and mingle with the Natives.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Next up, the ships stopped
      in Juneau where visitors saw the growing community and then traveled
      across Gastineau Channel to visit the Treadwell Mine. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The ships then steamed northwest
      to the mouth of Glacier Bay and the spectacular Muir Glacier.
      When the first explorers passed by Glacier Bay in the late 1700s,
      they didn't even realize that the bay existed because the Muir
      and other glaciers extended to the mouth of the bay. By the end
      of the 1800s, the glaciers had already retreated more than 40
      miles into the bay.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Heading south from Glacier
      Bay, most of the ships stopped Killisnoo, near Admiralty Island,
      where visitors were &quot;amused&quot; by the strong smell of
      the salmon cannery and herring saltery.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The final stop on most tours was Sitka, the old Russian American
      capital, and the center of American authority in the Alaska military
      district, such as it was. Once again, visitors were treated to
      totem poles and Native related curios, in addition to a visit
      to Sheldon Jackson's Native industrial school.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Occasionally, excursions visited
      other points in Southeast Alaska, most notably Loring, the Taku
      Glacier, and the Chilkat villages in upper Lynn Canal where visitors
      had to opportunity to purchase the valuable, and expensive, Chilkat
      blankets.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From the 1870s on, Alaska also
      benefited from increased interest by the national media. Two
      influential books in the early  1870s boosted interest,  William
      Henry Dall's &quot;Alaska and Its Resources&quot; and Frederick
      Whymper's &quot;Travel and Adventure in the Territory of Alaska&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The number of visitors to Alaska
      on steamships steadily rose from 1,650 in 1884 to 5,007 in 1890,
      according to historian Robert Campbell in his 2007 book about
      Alaska tourism &quot;In Darkest Alaska: Travel and Empire Along
      the Inside Passage.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another major milestone it
      the &quot;selling&quot; of Alaska came in 1891 when renowned
      African explorer Edward Glave visited Alaska on behalf of one
      of the major magazines, &quot;Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.&quot;
      Glave's articles stretched over three months in nine illustrated
      parts. Campbell noted in his book that the coverage spurred other
      magazines and newspapers to make similar visits to Alaska.</FONT></P>

      Renowned photographers such as Eadward Muybridge and Edward Curtis
      also visited Alaska and when their work was shown Outside it
      further spurred interest. The renowned landscape painter Albert
      Bierstadt also visited Alaska and was on hand for the grounding
      and sinking of the steamer Ancon in Loring in 1889 <A HREF="http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/AlbertBierstadt/021307_bierstadt.html">(see

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Visits to Alaska increased
      steadily until 1893, when a national recession took a large bite
      of tourism in all forms. That recession lasted until 1896, a
      year in which barely 2,000 visitors came to Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But within a year, more than
      100,000 people would begin streaming to Alaska for the Klondike
      Gold Rush and Alaska &shy; and the north country &shy; was back
      in the public eye.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> For the first couple of years
      of the rush, 1897 and 1898, the vast majority of the people streaming
      north were doing it to get rich and &quot;tourism&quot; was swamped
      as steamship companies and others scrambled to make space available
      to the &quot;Klondikers.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Since the vast majority of
      the gold rushers didn't get rich - or even mine claims, most
      of which were gone when they arrived - it has been suggested
      - by Canadian historian Pierre Berton  among others - that most
      were essentially &quot;tourists.&quot;</FONT></P>

      In Berton's 1958 book &quot;Klondike,&quot; he makes note of
      a pair of wealthy American women who arrived in Dawson early
      in the Rush with two great Danes, a bowling alley, a movie projector,
      50 live pigeons, a mandolin, a music box and an ice cream freezer.
      Obviously, they were not planning to work in the gold fields.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In early 1898, steamship companies
      anticipated that the all the publicity of the Gold Rush would
      lead to a boost in actual tourism and began booking excursions
      again, only now they added Skagway to the ports and in July of
      1898, the Skaguay Alaskan reported a visit by a tourist party
      of 60, according to Norris.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;A month later, a tourist
      ship arrived with 100 curiosity seekers,&quot; Norris wrote.
      &quot;They came to 'participate' in the gold rush and also to
      ride on the new railroad out of Skagway, construction of which
      had begun only a few months before. Although just four miles
      of the line was open, tourists enjoyed the ride to the end of
      the track.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It didn't take long for the
      residents of Skagway to see a gold rush in the increasing visitor
      traffic.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;By the summer of 1899,
      tourists were being catered to by local business establishments,&quot;
      Norris wrote. &quot;Skagway's new Chamber of Commerce began allotting
      money to advertise the town and a first ever clean up day was
      organized to improve the town's appearance for the tourists.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1899, train excursions extended
      to the summit of White Pass and on to Bennett Station in Canada.
      Among the prominent &quot;visitors&quot; to take the train ride
      were author/explorer William Henry Dall and Alaska Governor John
      G. Brady, according to Norris.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;By 1900, Skagway had
      not only become a regular stop on the excursion route, but a
      railroad trip had become an expected part of the Skagway stop,&quot;
      Norris added.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">During this period of time,
      tourism to other parts of Alaska also increased rapidly. River
      boats began carrying visitors down the Yukon and other rivers
      from Dawson and Whitehorse and coastal steamers expanded their
      routes across the Gulf of Alaska to Yakutat, Cordova, Valdez
      and Seward. Plans were also made in the early 1900s to create
      access into the Alaskan interior via train and roads.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But as tourism began to expand
      - the number of visitors topped 7,500 in 1905 - one popular destination
      was cut off the excursions. A massive earthquake near Glacier
      Bay in 1899 shattered the face of the Muir Glacier, making it
      unsafe for steamers to enter the bay. Various attempts were made
      to enter the bay up until 1907 before the steamship lines gave
      up. After that only specially chartered launches would be allowed
      into the Bay until the latter part of the 20th Century.<BR>
