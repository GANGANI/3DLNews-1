      Anchorage, Alaska - Over four hundred students, teachers and
      parents joined Governor Sean Parnell and Representative Berta
      Gardner (D- Anchorage) Wednesday as the governor signed House
      Bill 14 into law, making the Alaskan Malamute the official state
      dog. The signing was the culmination of three years work by students
      at Polaris K-12 School in Anchorage. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Three years ago kindergartener
      Paige Hill brought the idea to school. After some preliminary
      research, two first grade classes decided the Alaskan Malamute
      merited the designation and asked Rep. Gardner to carry the bill
      on their behalf.  By the time the bill was introduced in 2009,
      the project had grown into an all-school project.  </FONT></P>

      &quot;It was a good experience,&quot; said Hill, who is now in
      the third grade. &quot;It wasn't easy, but it was fun.  I am
      glad the Malamute is the state dog and my grandma Shirley is
      very proud of me.  It is very exciting to see the governor sign
      the bill.&quot; </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The students researched the
      Alaskan Malamute and the legislative process, drafted supporting
      documents for the bill and built public support for their cause.
       &quot;I'm honored to have been asked to be a part of this effort
      and am really proud of these students,&quot; said Gardner. &quot;I
      know they learned a lot, and I hope it inspires them to keep
      participating in the public process.&quot; &quot;The students
      of Polaris have worked long and hard to see this historic lesson
      in civics become a reality;  how fortunate for all of us to be
      participants in this event,&quot; said Denise Greene-Wilkinson,
      principal of Polaris K-12 School. &quot;This project was learning
      at its very best.  I'm both proud and impressed with the amazing
      efforts of all of our students,&quot; said Jamie Rodriguez, a
      teacher at Polaris K-12 School. &quot;If they are the future,
      we're in good hands.&quot; </FONT></P>

      history in Alaska</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Alaskan Malamute has played
      an important role in Alaska's history for at least four thousand
      years. Considered one of the twelve ancient breeds, the Alaskan
      Malamute evolved from the ancient dogs that accompanied prehistoric
      man in his migrations from Asia, reaching back to the earliest
      days of prehistory Alaska with the Mahlemut people, now known
      as Inuits, in Northwestern Alaska. They lived and worked closely
      with their dogs, depending on them as partners in hunting large
      game, hauling heavy loads, and even helping to watch children.
       Eighteenth and nineteenth century European explorers to Alaska
      were impressed with the breed and by the time of the gold rush,
      Alaskan Malamutes, with their ability to haul equipment and people,
      were in high demand. They were so highly valued that a prospector
      would pay $500 dollars for one good dog and $1500 for a small
      team. Long after the Gold Rush, Alaskan Malamutes continued to
      be valuable freight dogs. They were easy to care for and could
      pull heavy loads to areas that were otherwise inaccessible. During
      the 1925 Serum Run to Nome, about 150 sled dogs, including Alaskan
      Malamutes, relayed diphtheria antitoxin 674 miles by dog sled
      in a record-breaking five and a half days saving the small city
      of Nome and the surrounding communities from an incipient epidemic.
