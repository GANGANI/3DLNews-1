      A few years ago, 82-year-old Wilfred &quot;Wilf&quot; Blezard
      remembered the coldest day recorded in North America's history.
      Blezard was one of four weathermen stationed at the Snag airport
      in Yukon, Canada, on Feb. 3, 1947. On that day, the temperature
      dropped to minus 81 degrees Fahrenheit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;We had six dogs that
      stayed outside the barracks,&quot; Blezard said over the telephone
      from his home in Grande Prairie, Alberta. &quot;Their breath
      created quite a fog above them.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Blezard remembered tossing
      water into the air and watching it freeze into pellets before
      hitting the ground, and listening to the magnification of local
      sounds created by the severe temperature inversion.</FONT></P>

      &quot;When a plane flew over at 10,000 feet, it sounded like
      it was in your bedroom,&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On that day, Blezard and his
      coworkers for the Weather Service of Canada filed a notch into
      the glass casing of an alcohol thermometer because the indicator
      within fell below the lowest number, 80 below zero. When they
      later sent the thermometer to Toronto, officials there determined
      the temperature at Snag had dropped to minus 81.4 degrees Fahrenheit-the
      lowest official temperature ever recorded in North America.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I once visited Snag in mid-January
      with Jim Brader, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service
      in Fairbanks. We found a ghost town. The airfield that provided
      a home in 1947 to Blezard and three other meteorologists, several
      aircraft mechanics, and a few radio operators now features one
      shell of a log-sided building and an airstrip overgrown with
      balsam poplar trees.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Canadian and American construction
      crews completed the Snag airstrip in 1942 as part of a mission
      to create a series of safe landing places and weather stations
      between Edmonton and Fairbanks. Much of the air traffic at Snag
      was from American pilots who ferried planes northward as part
      of the lend/lease program to the Soviet Union.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Snag airstrip, located
      about 15 miles east of the border town of Beaver Creek, Yukon,
      does not look like the coldest place in North America. It sits
      on a plateau above the White River, 1,925 feet above sea level.
      Since cold air acts like water and flows downhill, one might
      expect a lower temperature in a place like Fairbanks, which is
      about 450 feet above sea level. Despite its relative height,
      Snag is the all-time cold champion because of the terrain that
      surrounds it, Brader said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Snag is an elevated valley
      but a relative low spot compared to the surrounding area,&quot;
      he said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Cold air that forms in the
      high peaks of the Wrangell and St. Elias mountains drains downhill
      and into the narrow White River basin, where the Snag airstrip
      is located. The high mountains also block the flow of warm, moist
      air from the ocean. That limits the formation of heat-trapping
      clouds over the White River basin, Brader said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Feb. 3, 1947, there probably
      were colder spots than the Snag airfield, Brader said. One site
      may have been the Native village of Snag, about three miles north
      of the airfield at the low junction of Snag Creek and the White
      River. The village, which was home to about 10 people at the
      time, did not have an official thermometer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;There probably were colder
      spots, but we don't have a lot of observing sites compared to
      the amount of area we have,&quot; Brader said. &quot;As far as
      sites where observations were done, Snag was the coldest, but,
      undoubtedly, there were colder sites.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For the record, Alaska's coldest
      official temperatures on Feb. 3, 1947 reflected the cold dome
      of air that hung over Snag. Tanacross registered minus 75 degrees
      that day, Northway was shivering at minus 70 degrees, and Fort
      Yukon fell to minus 68 degrees one day later.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Since that February morning
      when the 26-year-old Blezard witnessed the coldest official thermometer
      reading in North America's written history, Alaska has come awfully
      close to beating the record. On Jan. 23, 1971, weather observers
      at Prospect Creek, a pipeline camp 25 miles southeast of Bettles,
      recorded Alaska's all-time low of minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
      On that day, the temperature at Snag was unavailable; Canadians
      had abandoned the airstrip in 1967.<BR>
