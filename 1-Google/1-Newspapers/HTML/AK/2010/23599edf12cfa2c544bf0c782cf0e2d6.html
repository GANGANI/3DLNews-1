      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hagiwara was born and raised
      in Ketchikan and served in the military in World War II. Like
      all local Japanese American residents he was swept up in the
      controversy over the World War internment of Japanese American
      citizens. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hagiwara was born on March
      7, 1919, the second son of local bakery owners Frank and Shima
      Hagiwara.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to an oral history
      at the Alaska State Museum that Hagiwara sat for in 1990, his
      father Chokichi &quot;Frank&quot; Hagiwara and two friends left
      Seattle, Washington, in 1909, hoping to &quot;make a fortune&quot;
      in Alaska.  They intended to earn money in Ketchikan before continuing
      to interior Alaska but Frank Hagiwara decided to stay in Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1916, Frank Hagiwara returned
      to Japan for an arranged marriage to Shima Kitagawa, a school
      teacher. Frank and Shima had four children in Ketchikan.<BR>
       <BR>
      In the oral history, Pat Hagiwara noted that his family lived
      &quot;modestly, kept a minimum amount of Japanese culture&quot;
      in their home, and worked &quot;many hours every day in the family
      bakery&quot; from 1919 to 1942 when they were evacuated during
      the war.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hagiwara also noted that he
      had both &quot;hakujin&quot; (Caucasian) and Japanese friends
      in Ketchikan, adding that discrimination was not a problem until
      World War II broke out.<BR>
       <BR>
      In a letter to the Ketchikan Museum in 2000, Hagiwara sent along
      some youth baseball photos from his early years. He apologized
      for not being able to identify all the children in the photos.<BR>
       <BR>
      &quot;It has been nearly 70 years since I last saw most of them
      and, today, you might say my memory of sandlot baseball is not
      very good,&quot; Hagiwara wrote in 2000. &quot;I still remember
      while I was in the 4th grade, I was a pitcher and we won a trophy
      that year and our coach was Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Foss (of
      the Kayhi class of 1931). I see Kelly (as I did this year) at
      our annual Ketchikan Reunion Picnic held at Edmonds City Park
      on the 4th Sunday in July.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
      Hagiwara graduated from Ketchikan High School in 1936 and worked
      in his family's bakery, the Alaska Home Bakery, on Stedman Street,
      until 1940.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the oral history, Hagiwara
      said that Fred Van Gilder encouraged him to join the Alaska Guard
      in 1940. He and several other local Guardsmen were sent to Port
      Chilkoot in Haines when the state Guard was nationalized at the
      outbreak of war.<BR>
       <BR>
      When World War II began, Hagiwara said he and his friends, and
      fellow guard members, Charlie Tatsuda, Bob Urata, and Jimmy Tatsuda
      encountered an &quot;awkward and difficult&quot; period as people
      &quot;suspected their motives and allegiance.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Then in February, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive
      Order 9066, which led to the forced evacuation of nearly all
      of the Japanese American families on the U.S. Pacific Coast,
      including Alaska.<BR>
       <BR>
      Initially, the local Issei &shy; or Japanese born males - were
      put under armed guard as potential &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;
       Most were moved to the growing military base on Annette Island.<BR>
       <BR>
       Then all of the Ketchikan Japanese American were evacuated to
      Seattle in April 1942. According to information from the Tongass
      Historical Museum, Ketchikan had the highest number of internees
      in the state, 59. Only a handful, four families, would return
      to Ketchikan after the war. Hagiwara's parents settled in Chicago.<BR>
       <BR>
      As the military prepared to evacuate Southeast Alaska Issei &shy;
      Japanese born - males, like his father Frank, to Annette Island,
      Pat Hagiwara recalls being placed in the &quot;unenviable position
      of having to send for and stand guard over some Isseis.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
       To comply with Executive Order 9066, Pat Hagiwara and his comrades
      transferred out of Alaska in late April 1942 and eventually ended
      up at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where Hagiwara became a training
      instructor before heading overseas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">En route south, as his ship
      approached Annette Island, Pat Hagiwara asked the captain if
      he could stop to see his father, saying that he might never see
      him again. The captain said, &quot;No.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Gazing ashore, after docking,
      Pat Hagiwara saw a jeep racing down to the dock toward the ship.
      &quot;Patrick Hagiwara,&quot; boomed over the jeep's loudspeaker
      as the chaplain, who was driving, called &quot;jump in.&quot;<BR>
       <BR>
       The chaplain delivered him to a canvas tent where his father,
      and Isseis Tanino, Suzuki, Shimizu, Ohashi, Kimura and Togo huddled.
      Pat Hagiwara says that was the last time he saw his father until
      November 1943 at the Minidoka Internment Camp.<BR>
       <BR>
      Not all the situations involving the internment turned out as
      well, though.<BR>
       <BR>
      According to information in the Tongass Historical Museum records,
      Charlie Tatsuda was prevented from his visiting his dying sister
      in Ketchikan when he was at Port Chilkoot. The other family members
      had already been moved to the Lower 48, but the young girl was
      too sick to be moved. Finally, one of his other sisters was allowed
      to return briefly to Ketchikan, but the younger sister died before
      she arrived.<BR>
       <BR>
      Also during that time, Hagiwara noted that he was in charge of
      guarding some of the more prominent Issei of Juneau, including
      two businessmen named Tanaka and Fukuyama as they waited to be
      evacuated to Seattle.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pat Hagiwara joined the 442
      Regimental Combat Team in Europe. Charlie Tatsuda was sent to
      military intelligence school in Minnesota. He graduated as an
      interpreter and was assigned to the paratroopers. <BR>
      Although most of the Japanese American service men went to Europe,
      Tatsuda served in the Pacific Theater, the Philippines, and Japan.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">During the war, Hagiwara was
      a decorated veteran - and staff sergeant - in the 442 Regimental
      Combat Team. The 442, made up primarily of family members of
      the Japanese Americans who were interned during the war, was
      one of the most decorated in U.S. history with more than 1,000
      Purple Hearts and 21 Congressional Medal of Honor winners. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It fought through Europe, most
      notably in Italy and France. Hagiwara remained proud of his service
      and was active in both military reunions and the Nisei Veterans
      Committee of Seattle through the remainder of his life.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hagiwara married Misako Kondo
      in 1942. The couple moved to Seattle in 1945, while Hagiwara
      attended the University of Washington, graduating with a degree
      in electrical engineering. He worked as an engineer and manager
      for Boeing, retiring in 1986 after 36 years with the company.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The family moved to the Rainier
      Valley in 1951 and their children were the first Japanese Americans
      to attend the Brighton Elementary School, according to an funeral
      home obituary written by the family. The Hagiwaras moved to Bellevue
      in 1968.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In addition to serving as a
      coach for many of his six children's sporting teams, Hagiwara
      was also a member of the vestry of St. Peter's Episcopal, following
      in the steps of his father as a church leader.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although Hagiwara never returned
      to live in Alaska after World War II, he was an active member
      of the Alaska Yukon Pacific Pioneers and rarely missed the Ketchikan
      Reunion Picnic that is held each year in Edmonds. He also kept
      in touch with many of his Ketchikan High School classmates over
      the years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He is survived by his wife,
      Misako, his children Kathleen Hagiwara Purcell of Issaquah, Washington;
      Patrick Hagiwara of Northridge, California; Janet Cantelon of
      Des Moines, Washington; Grace Hagiwara of Mountain View, California;
      Juli Alsgaard of Glendale, California and Robert Hagiwara of
      Winnipeg, Manitoba; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren
      and numerous nieces and nephews.</FONT></P>
