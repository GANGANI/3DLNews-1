      If there is one moment at the start of our country that probably
      ensured our ongoing freedom more than any other it was when Ben
      Franklin talked everyone else into building and opening libraries
      to the masses. Books were too expensive for most people in those
      days and therefore a lot of information was being held by a small
      number of people.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">However, Franklin knew that
      discussion, debate and even heated arguments based on as much
      information and facts as possible were the best prevention of
      anarchy and the best step toward invention and creation of new
      ideas. If voting rights were going to be opened wide beyond landowners,
      and therefore beyond book buyers, then the flow of information
      needed to somehow get to more people too.</FONT></P>

      A system of libraries across the newly found America was his
      solution to making sure the ideal of democracy was kept alive
      for generations to come. He set the tone by not requiring that
      libraries leave out other ideas, and in particular political
      views, therefore making it possible for people to form their
      own opinions. That's what countries like Iran fear most.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Libraries made it possible
      for those who couldn't afford an expensive education to still
      be able to gain access to a rich wealth of information. There
      have even been studies in recent years that show a correlation
      between an active and healthy library and a lower crime rate
      in a neighborhood.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I already had a love affair
      going with words when I was five and when I first saw the vast
      children's room in the Philadelphia Library I felt a chill that
      started at my red Buster Browns and rose right up to my pixie
      haircut. I was overwhelmed with a five-year-old size of gratitude
      that the adults had been smart enough to dream up a place like
      this.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Before that moment I had sensed
      that the world was largely a practical place. Taxes were collected
      to make sure that there were firemen to protect us, schools to
      educate us and highway crews to pave the roads. They were all
      necessities that keep a community running smoothly and benefit
      everyone equally.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But luxuries of any kind that
      weren't a requirement to keep a body going were only for special
      occasions. I had thought books fell into that category and took
      great care with the hand-me-down Dr. Seuss books.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then I found out about libraries.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Libraries are still a place
      that are completely open to the interpretation of the warm body
      holding the library card and the books they check out. We can
      choose to learn more about history or sink into a thriller or
      just read about a celebrity we admire. There's no one asking
      us why we picked that book and so no judgment and we are free
      to gather a little more information and even be entertained for
      a little while.</FONT></P>

      But then there are also moments when a book can save our life.
      I remember listening to a new author talk about what had been
      a very oppressive childhood that by the time she was 13 had lead
      to a deep sense of hopelessness till the day she found a book
      at her small local library. The novel had a protagonist that
      mirrored her experience and for the first time in her young life
      she realized she wasn't alone and there were choices to be made.
      It changed everything and opened up her limited vision beyond
      the stifling neighborhood where she lived.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It may seem in the age of the
      internet and hand-held reading devices that both books and libraries
      are becoming quaint and a thing of the past. However, libraries
      still hold two very important things that neither Google nor
      a Kindle will ever be able to offer us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The first is that libraries
      give everyone regardless of income the chance to participate
      and learn to their heart's content. No computer or internet service
      required. The second is they provide the anonymity to do it.
      Just after 9/11 when the Federal Government demanded libraries
      turn over lists of what patrons were reading in order to better
      fix, manage and control the rest of us, librarians stood firm
      and said no.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They understood that coming
      to a place of fairness and balance requires actually learning
      about opposing viewpoints without the threat of interrogation
      or arrest. They chose to protect the flow of information for
      all of us rather than limit a basic freedom based on a fear of
      a few of us. They upheld the ideal first created by Franklin
      and in some small way defeated the aim of terrorists. In return
      we can go check out a book this week and on our way out, thank
      a librarian for her service.</FONT></P>
