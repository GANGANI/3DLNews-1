      (SitNews) -  The humpback whale discovered last Wednesday draped
      across the bulbous bow of the Sapphire Princess was likely deceased
      before it was struck by the cruise ship, says NOAA's National
      Marine Fisheries Service.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Princess Cruises notified the
      Coast Guard and NOAA Fisheries of the incident, which had likely
      occurred overnight while the vessel was underway in Chatham Strait.
      The Sapphire Princess was in Tracy Arm en route to Juneau at
      the time of the discovery. The whale was removed from the bow
      of the ship near the end of Douglas Island by a tugboat, towed
      to shore, and secured for necropsy.</FONT></P>

      - including staff from NOAA Fisheries, the Alaska Sea Life Center
      and volunteers - performing the necropsy.</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The team of responders - including staff from NOAA Fisheries,
      the Alaska Sea Life Center and volunteers - performed the necropsy
      Friday. Preliminary results released today are not definitive.
      It could be several months before final results are available.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Scientists found that this
      was a complex case, as evidence indicated that several events
      had likely transpired by the time the whale was found on the
      bow of the cruise ship. Lead veterinarian Dr. Pam Tuomi from
      the Alaska Sea Life Center and NOAA Fisheries veterinarian Dr.
      Kate Savage agreed that the most likely scenario may have involved
      three different events:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A missing pectoral fin points
        to an initial boat strike in which a propeller likely amputated
        the flipper, which then caused debilitation and/or death;</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This may have been followed
        by killer whale scavenging, as a large portion of the ventral
        pleats in the lower jaw was missing (an area of the body typically
        targeted by killer whales);</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Eventual entrapment by the
        Sapphire Princess vessel likely followed this, when the ship's
        bow came in contact with the floating carcass.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The team recovered one of the
      whale's eyes, which can be used to age the animal. They also
      collected other samples for further analysis, including skin,
      muscle, blubber, liver, kidney, ovaries, stomach contents, parasites,
      urine, and feces, which will be sent to various labs for contaminant
      analysis, genetics, and indications of exposure to toxins like
      harmful algal blooms.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Our first priority is
      to try to determine cause of death,&quot; said Aleria Jensen,
      NOAA Fisheries stranding coordinator for Alaska. &quot;But there
      is also a tremendous amount we can learn from an animal like
      this about life history, feeding habits, exposure to toxins,
      and impacts from human activities. Stranded marine mammals can
      really be considered sentinels for marine ecosystem health.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One such finding was an exam
      to measure the stomach contents of a fully grown humpback whale.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The whale had basically
      two things in its stomach-krill and water,&quot; said Ron Heintz,
      a scientist at the Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute in Juneau.
      &quot;We measured at least 65 gallons of volume.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Researchers are also trying
      to match the markings on the tail fluke of the female humpback
      to existing photos of whales in Southeast Alaska humpback whale
      catalogues.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The necropsy was conducted
      under the umbrella of the Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Network,
      part of a larger national network which monitors marine mammal
      health and responds to dead animals and live marine mammals in
      distress. The Alaska network consists of trained responders which
      stretch across the state, from Ketchikan to Dutch Harbor to Nome.
      Activities of the network are authorized by the Marine Mammal
      Protection Act, and in this case involving a humpback whale,
      through the Endangered Species Act.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ship strikes with large whales
      in Alaska appear to be increasing, which may be a result of an
      increasing population of humpback whales in the North Pacific
      as well as greater reporting effort.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mariners are urged to slow
      their speeds when whales are spotted in the vicinity of travel,
      as well as when traveling in areas of known whale density such
      as Frederick Sound, Icy Strait, Chatham Strait and Lynn Canal.
      Vessels are encouraged to post lookouts and to travel with utmost
      vigilance at night.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mariners are requested to report
      any sightings of whales in distress to the NOAA Fisheries Marine
      Mammal Hotline at (877) 925-7773.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">NOAA Fisheries would like to
      remind the public that humpback whales are protected by both
      the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species
      Act (ESA). Tampering with or removing parts from the carcass
      is prohibited, and personal possession of any parts from a listed
      animal is a violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</FONT></P>
