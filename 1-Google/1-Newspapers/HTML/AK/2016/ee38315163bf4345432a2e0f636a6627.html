      </FONT>(SitNews) -  The death of the dictator of Cuba took over our headlines for a few days and made some world leaders look pretty stupid.</P>
      <p>Canada's leader Justin Trudeau reacted as if Fidel Castro was a saint to be mourned, not a thug whose death should be celebrated.</p>
      <p>Our own cool president was careful to not say a negative word about the Left's evil superhero.</p>
      <p>Our next president may or may not make America great again with his liberal-conservative mix of ideas and goals, but he sure got St. Fidel right.</p>
      <p>Donald Trump's statement called Castro a &quot;brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades&quot; and left a legacy of &quot;firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.&quot;<br>

      <p align="center">Twitter tirades <br>
        By Adam Zyglis Â©2016, The Buffalo News</p>
      <p><br>
        Fidel's death briefly overshadowed the dumb tweets Trump sent out in reaction to Jill Stein and the Green Party asking for a recount of votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The recount is a waste of time and money. It won't change the results.</p>
      <p>In each state we're talking about tens of thousands of votes separating Trump and Hillary Clinton, not 500, like it was in Florida in 2000. </p>
      <p>Hillary Clinton's decision to join Stein in her recount crusade makes no sense. </p>
      <p>If Stein had not been in the race, there was a good chance Hillary would have won Michigan, where she lost to Trump by a little less than 11,000.</p>
      <p>Plus, the outcome of the presidential election is not in doubt. Hillary has already lost to Trump. Now the country gets to watch her lose again in the recount.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it was even sillier for Trump to react to the recount by tweeting ---- without having any evidence -- that he would have won the popular vote if &quot;millions&quot; of people hadn't voted illegally. </p>
      <p>Someone needs to tell the president-elect, &quot;Donald, it doesn't matter. You won. Pick your Cabinet.&quot; </p>
      <p>Donald's gigantic ego has been bruised because he didn't win the popular vote.</p>
      <p>Maybe he doesn't know that's why the Founding Fathers set up the Electoral College. They didn't want voters in a few big states like New York to elect the president and wanted small states to have skin in the game.</p>
      <p>If you win by 3 million votes in California, by the way, it's not because of illegal votes. It's because we have a one-party state. </p>
      <p>Trump should have stayed away from the whole recount issue. If he starts making his decisions as president based on his ego, he'll be a huge failure.</p>
      <p>We just had one of those big-ego presidents. How did eight years of Obama work out?</p>
      <p>While I'm at it, there's another thing bugging me.</p>
      <p>For as long as I've been alive we've been talking about electing a businessman president.</p>
      <p>Now we've elected one and people are worried about him being a businessman.</p>
      <p>Trump's got hotels and golf courses and properties all around the world. CNN says it's 144 companies in 25 countries.</p>
      <p>Good for him. I hope all of them are obscenely successful for the next four years. </p>
      <p>Equally, I hope the country becomes as successful as Trump says he wants to make it. </p>
      <p>If we're as successful as Trump wants to make us, who cares how well he is doing?</p>
      <p>Actually, most liberals do. But I don't care if he ends up with $20 billion as long as the rest of America doesn't end up any more bankrupt than it already is.</p>
      <p>As for the question of ethics, the liberal media should calm down. </p>
      <p>Trump's people will figure out a way to prevent conflicts of interests and have his kids take over his businesses.</p>
      <p>What I've seen of his talented children, they have more than enough ingenuity to run them. </p>
      <p>Some Democrats and media people ---- i.e., liberals ---- won't be happy unless President Trump sells off everything and turns his kids into welfare recipients.</p>
      <p>Instead of passing out turkeys on Thanksgiving Day they'd rather see them receiving them.</p>
      <p>But what do they know? They're liberals. The same people who thought Fidel was a saint.</p>
