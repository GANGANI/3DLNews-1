      If Al Gore is a hypocrite, does it matter? No sooner had &quot;An
      Inconvenient Truth&quot; won an Oscar for best documentary feature
      than the Tennessee Center for Policy Research accused Gore, when
      he's not flying around the world in a private jet to preach self-righteous
      sermons on excessive energy consumption, of living in a Nashville
      mansion that consumes about 20 times as much energy as the homes
      of average Americans.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But the case isn't clear-cut.
      The Tennessee Center for Policy Research supports principles
      on its Web site that are rigorously conservative and reflect
      a perspective that we don't ordinarily associate with concern
      over global warming. Their figures about Gore's energy consumption
      are construed to make him look as bad as possible. They also
      appear to be more or less accurate. Clearly, Gore, champion of
      energy efficiency and decreased consumption, does consume an
      awful lot of energy. </FONT></P>

      On the other hand, his defenders argue that by buying so-called
      &quot;carbon offsets,&quot; Gore manages to compensate for his
      energy use, effectively &quot;zeroing out&quot; his impact on
      the environment, which is what he calls for in &quot;An Inconvenient
      Truth.&quot; Few of us can make that claim. In fact, if all of
      the world's citizens were willing and able to do that, global
      warming wouldn't be an issue at all. Of course, not everyone
      accepts the &quot;carbon offset&quot; argument and, frankly,
      it does seem like a bit of a stretch.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's important to remember
      that serious global-warming non-believers are likely to be unmoved
      by Gore's message, regardless of his personal lifestyle. Even
      if Gore lived in a log cabin powered entirely by wind and solar
      and drove an electric car, I suspect that his critics would be
      more likely to dismiss him to the lunatic fringe than to be persuaded
      by his message.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Because his message isn't easy
      to listen to. If Gore is right - or even half right - the next
      four or five decades are going to be difficult and chaotic. Either
      we'll experience a remarkable alteration in our climate that
      includes some version of the catastrophes that Gore portrays
      dramatically in his film or we'll manage to prevent those catastrophes
      by extraordinary alterations to the comfortable, consumption-based
      life that hydrocarbons have made possible. Both alternatives
      are equally daunting. Gore's is a message that no one wants to
      hear.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Therefore, it's not hard to
      find columnists and commentators who are willing to ridicule
      the message and the messenger or to find a few scientists who
      are willing to swim against the tide of scientific consensus
      about global warming. In fact, you can even find commentators
      who admit that global warming is real and that we are contributing
      to it, but who argue that it's actually going to be good for
      us.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">These naysayers should be listened
      to. But we have to remember that we have a very strong emotional
      incentive to hope that they're right: our desire that our lives
      go on just as they are and that disasters don't lie ahead, even
      in the face of a lot of evidence.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Nearly a year ago, on April
      14, 2006, The Chronicle of Higher Education began a review of
      five new books on climate change with this lead: &quot;The scientific
      evidence that the earth is getting warmer, and that human activity
      is at least partly responsible, is overwhelming. Almost no climatologists
      now dispute the idea that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
      are heating up our planet.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And in its Feb. 16, 2007, issue,
      an article titled &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; reports on the findings
      of the 1,200 scientists who contributed to the climate assessment
      by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The article
      points out that a number of respected scientists argue that the
      panel's grim assessment of our climate future is much too conservative
      and that our prospects are actually dimmer than we might hope.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So is Gore a hypocrite? In
      the face of what a lot of serious scientists are telling us,
      and only a few are denying, it doesn't matter. The real question
      is whether we let our judgment of what seems to be happening
      to us be overwhelmed by our desire to keep things just as they
      are.</FONT></P>
