      Ketchikan, Alaska - The petty dictators of airplane discipline
      gave travelers an early Christmas present recently by allowing
      us to take water on plane flights again. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Water had been banned you remember
      because it was dangerous. At least that was the theory. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Some really clever miscreants
      in Britain had been foiled in their attempt to create some sort
      of water-based bombs and blow up a whole bunch of airplanes.
      Therefore we were forced to hand over our Dasanis and Purple
      Mountains at the gate</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Good thing too. The beverage
      service on flights was getting so bad that people were BYOBing
      so much liquid that the overhead bins were getting too full of
      spritzer and airline toilets were flushing so often that it was
      a challenge keeping the planes aloft. </FONT></P>

      Not to mention the fact that the Midwest was getting bombarded
      by so much of that frozen flotsam (it's only called jetsam at
      the point of deplaning!) that the National Weather Service was
      declaring vertical tsunami alerts for most locations immediately
      west of O'Hare International or east of DIA.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of course, cynical folks might
      say the water ban was solely to encourage passengers to gorge
      themselves on the more expensive &quot;in flight&quot; beverages,
      thereby engaging in self-sedation and not noticing that &quot;five-star
      in flight service&quot; now consisted of two (2) packs of peanuts
      on the Seattle to Anchorage run.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps it was just a coincidence
      that the planes seemed to run out of the free water, soda and
      juices even before the &quot;it's okay to fire up the personal
      electronics&quot; bell would go off on the climb past 10,000
      feet. I think not.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At any rate, our aeronautical
      dehydration nightmare is finally over. And just in time, because
      it looks like all that extra &quot;passenger carry-on&quot; water
      will come in handy. It seems we've got a rash of &quot;in cabin
      fires&quot; to contend with.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Admit it, you always snicker
      when the pre-flight safety spiel reminds you that &quot;federal
      law prohibits tampering with the smoke detectors in the lavatory.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It's hard to imagine that anyone
      is so hard up for a smoke that they would risk the wrath of the
      TSA, the air marshals and their fellow passengers (who since
      9-11 feel more emboldened to gang up and &quot;whup the living
      tar&quot; out of any fellow passenger acting the least bit odd
      or - God forbid - looking foreign).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But now it seems that in cabin
      &quot;fires&quot; really are a serious concern. There have been
      two in recent weeks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the most recent, a Continental
      Airlines flight from Houston to Portland had to make an emergency
      stop in Colorado Springs because of a small fire.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was an odd little event.
      It seems a passenger was using one of those portable &quot;air
      filters&quot; that you wear around your neck to reduce the odor
      of your fellow cross country inmates and to also make sure that
      you are breathing air untouched by human germs. </FONT></P>

      Considering that airlines now save money by recycling economy
      class air through two Renuzits in the rear lavatories (can't
      call them bathrooms because there is no bath or restrooms because
      there is no.), it was probably not a bad idea to get on board
      the jet with a personal air filter. But this particular device
      got so overworked that it caught on fire.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No word about whether the passenger
      was hurt by the malfunction but the smell of smoke (and the flashbacks
      of that yahoo trying to light his &quot;shoe bombs&quot; on fire
      a few years ago) immediately caused the diversion.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Also no word on whether or
      not neighboring passengers were able to use their now legal personal
      hydration devices to douse the flaming personal air filter, but
      I certainly would have deployed my water bottle in a similar
      situation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The other flight that got interrupted
      also involved odors and fire, though a little bit differently.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">An American Airlines flight
      from Washington D.C. to Dallas was diverted to Nashville (tout
      de suite!!!) because passengers smelled sulphur from a burning
      match. No, it wasn't someone lighting up in the restroom, at
      least not that way.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Apparently the cause was a
      passenger who was concerned about a certain gaseous emission
      and decided to cover it with a match.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Where I come from lighting
      a match after a toot could be considered almost suicidal. Right
      up there with tossing a cigarette down the hole in an outhouse.
      We've all heard how that turns out and it's not pretty.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But this person was obviously
      raised in a different environment. An environment where a burning
      match was apparently the next best thing to a big splash of rosewater.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Anyway, this southern belle
      wanted to cover up the smell and lit a match. Natch, that led
      to a flight diversion and a quick stop in Nashville (where, no
      doubt, someone is already writing a song - &quot;I'm Excreting,
      on a Jet Plane&quot; - to immortalize the incident to be released
      on &quot;Jingle Smells&quot; the next album by Flatulina and
      the Vapors).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I can see the point of those
      concerned about the smell of burning sulphur (or in this case
      the smell of someone burning sulpher in an attempt to cover up
      the sulphurous smell of a eye-burning gastronomic bomb) on a
      plane.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fire at 29,000 feet is not
      something to trifled with. Particularly since using the wings
      for the &quot;family fire safety gathering place&quot; is problematic
      at best.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So it is a good thing that
      the aristocrats of air travel have decided that &quot;packing'
      water is okay. We will now be fully armed in the event we need
      to douse a flaming row mate.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, if we can just get the
      rajahs of the jetstream to ban the chili at the airport snack
      bar.</FONT></P>
