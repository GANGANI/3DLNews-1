      &quot;I was never so amazed in my life as when the Sniffer drew
      his concealed weapon from its case and struck me to the ground,
      stone dead.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is my favorite opening
      line from a novel. So I figured if it worked for Robertson Davies
      in &quot;Murther and Walking Spirits&quot;, it would be a good
      way to start this commentary. However, this commentary isn't
      about murder or mysterious characters with names that evoke images
      of non-prescription drug use. That would be cheap sensationalism.
      This commentary is about a woman with a generous bosom. </FONT><TABLE

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Dolly Parton's not the tallest
      Dixie Chick on the country music scene. And she may have been
      raised in Shortsville, Tennessee. But there is no denying the
      fact that she's got huge talents. She has a big heart too.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Singing, song-writing, and
      acting, are among her well-known talents. But folks in Tennessee
      know that she also has a talent for organizing community efforts
      to improve the literacy of preschool children from hill or vale.
      With Governor Bredesen's help, Tennessee became the first state
      to offer the &quot;Imagination Library&quot; program - <I>free</I>
      - to children statewide. All that parents have to do is register
      their children, which can be done online or by calling the toll-free
      number 1-877-99BOOKS. Once registered, they will receive a colorful
      &quot;board book&quot; in the mail, every month until their 5th
      birthday.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you live in another state,
      or a Canadian province, go to <A HREF="http://www.imaginationlibrary.com/">www.imaginationlibrary.com</A>
      to see if Dolly's dreams for children's literacy have taken root
      in your community.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most toddlers can't read. And
      these books don't have the silicon chips and transducers that
      musical birthday cards do. So when the book arrives, it's up
      to you to read it with your child. And, like &quot;The Little
      Engine That Could&quot; (Dolly's favorite book prop), your little
      dream machine could be reading years before he or she takes their
      first No Child Left Behind multiple-choice test.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you are wondering why preschool
      reading is important to chemistry, I suggest you visit your nearest
      university bookstore. After you get over the sticker-shock of
      a freshman chemistry textbook (sometimes over $100), notice the
      condition of some of the ones marked &quot;USED&quot;. The conditions
      of a few might suggest that the dog was still hungry after eating
      the homework. But I'll bet others can only be distinguished from
      the new ones by the stickers: the USED one and the price one.
      (Hurry, these sell fast!)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Judging from the pristine quality
      of these &quot;used&quot; textbooks, I would also wager that
      the previous owners spent more time driving around campus parking
      lots looking for a spot than actually reading the textbook. I'll
      admit that it can take a long time to find a good parking spot
      on a bustling campus, but it takes even longer to master challenging
      concepts such as electron configurations or the second law of
      thermodynamics.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Amazingly, I often hear the
      question &quot;Are we going to use the textbook?&quot; Chemistry
      professors don't always agree. For instance, there still isn't
      complete consensus about man-made global warming caused by rising
      atmospheric levels of CO2, which is transparent to visible light
      but has strong &quot;heat-trapping&quot; absorption bands in
      the infrared part of the spectrum. You might expect that this
      would have been confirmed or refuted in the time since Professor
      Arrhenius reported on this phenomenon in 1896. (No, that's not
      a typo. Google Arrhenius and greenhouse.)</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There <I>is</I> perfect consensus
      about one thing though. It is humanly impossible to cover <I>all</I>
      the material in a freshman chemistry textbook <I>in the classroom</I>.
      In fact, some schools are custom ordering textbooks with major
      portions of general chemistry omitted, just to keep the cost
      (and weight) of the books down.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Suppose, in the future, research
      into feasible solutions to our energy problems turns toward the
      Sun. What if the chapter on silicon chemistry (the basis of photovoltaic
      materials) was left on the publisher's floor when preparing your
      college's textbook order? Will you be left behind?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Students who are serious about
      finding chemical solutions to environmental problems are expected
      to read on their own outside of class, and not just from the
      textbook (although that's the best place to start). After all,
      you never know from which part of the periodic table the next
      unexpected discovery will come from. Louis Pasteur, a famous
      French chemist and biologist, said it best: &quot;Chance favors
      the prepared mind.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I guess what I'm trying to
      say is that an ingrained love of learning, which is greatly enhanced
      by enjoyment of reading, is a prerequisite for mastering any
      intellectual endeavor, be it chemistry or song-writing.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As Dolly says, &quot;Keep Reading&quot;.<BR>
