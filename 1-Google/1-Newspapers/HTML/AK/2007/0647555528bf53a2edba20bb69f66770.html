      Ketchikan, Alaska - On August 28, 1889, the side-wheel steamer
      Ancon made one of its regular stops in the small village on Loring
      in Naha Bay on Revillagigedo Island, 20 miles north of what would
      later become Ketchikan. It was heading back south after a run
      up the Inside Passage from Port Townsend, Washington to Sitka,
      Juneau, Fort Wrangell and Chilcat (Klukwan).</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ancon which had been built
      in New York in 1867, according to Alaska maritime historian Doug
      Charles, and purchased by San Francisco based Pacific Coast Steamship
      Co. in 1876. It had previously made some local history when it
      delivered the Rev. William Duncan to his new community of Metlakatla
      on Annette Island in 1886. The Ancon had been making the Alaska
      run since 1882.</FONT></P>

      Its visit to Loring - to drop off supplies and mail, and let
      a few hardy, early Southeast Alaska tourists stretch their legs
      - would prove to be equally noteworthy. After arrival, the ship
      also loaded up some 14,000 cases of canned salmon from the Alaska
      Packers Association Cannery that was the prime reason for Loring's
      existence.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ancon had left Port Townsend,
      Washington on August 12 on its regular, nearly three week long
      run that it undertook several times each summer up the Inside
      Passage. It stopped at salmon canneries and salteries as well
      as the major settlements along the way. The ship also took a
      side trip into Glacier Bay which was still half covered by glaciers
      in those days.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It spent several hours in Loring.
      At 3 a.m. on the 29th, the ship cast off.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;On the wharf a Chinaman,
      one of the cannery hands, was casting the lines,&quot; Historian
      Pat Roppel wrote in the Alaska Journal. &quot;He did not understand
      when Captain (H.H.) Lloyd called out to keep the stern lines
      secure so the ship could swing around on them as she left the
      wharf. A stiff wind was blowing and when the cannery hand let
      the stern lines go, the men at the wheel could not keep the ship
      in the narrow waterway. The Ancon drifted hard onto a reef that
      was (only) a few feet out from shore.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The rock pierced the hull of
      the 226-foot ship and water poured in. The 200 passengers and
      crew were evacuated in the middle of a driving rainstorm. Most
      were given shelter inside the cannery building, although some
      of the women passengers stayed in the superintendent's house
      and some of the men bunked with the Native fishermen who had
      two dozen cabins around cannery and wharf, according to Roppel.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Roppel wrote: &quot;(passenger)
      Ben Kramer of Lakeport, Indiana described Loring this way: 'This
      place is nothing but a fishing camp. It contains a salmon cannery
      and about 100 white men who work about it during the season,
      but not one solitary white woman. About two dozen cabins, with
      the cannery and the wharf, compose the village.'&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Among the visitors forced to
      seek refuge in tiny Loring were the Governor of Colorado, William
      &quot;Billy&quot; Adams and his family and a young man from a
      politically prominent New York family, Benjamin Fairchild.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The visitors initially expected
      to have to wait in Loring for at least a week for word of the
      disaster to get South and a ship to be sent to pick them up.
      But the next day the Pacific Coast Steamship Company vessel George
      W. Elder (which later gained fame as the vessel the 1899 Harriman
      Scientific Expedition used to Alaska), arrived on its regular
      run and its dcrew offered to immediately take the stranded passengers
      south.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Once the Elder departed, crews
      salvaged as much of the canned salmon and other cargo as they
      could. Most of the wood from the ship was later used to build
      cabins and repair the cannery and wharf.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ancon was left to break
      up on the rocks. Today you can still see the remains of its boilers
      at low tide off Loring.</FONT></P>

      That would have been the end of the story, except that also among
      the &quot;tourists&quot; was Albert Bierstadt, then renowned
      as one of the most famous landscape painters of the American
      West. Bierstadt quickly sketched the scene from the beach and
      when he returned to New York , he created an oil painting that
      is now considered one of his greatest works.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ancon painting features
      the strong, expressive imagery of much of Bierstadt's works,
      but with little of the &quot;shining glory&quot; he often portrayed.
      Apparently viewed at dusk, much of the canvas is taken up by
      the grey water and the somewhat ominous great clouds along the
      horizon and above the listing ship. A thin point of land reaches
      out to the ship, mirroring the shore of the rest of Revillagigedo
      Island in the distance.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The only bright color in the
      photo is some late in the day sunlight on the yellowish sidewheels.
      The tone of the picture clearly indicates that the future of
      the ship is not promising. The Ancon is listing toward a break
      in the clouds in the distance, but help will not be coming for
      the stricken ship.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Albert Bierstadt was born in
      Germany in 1930, but his family emigrated to the United States
      when he was still a toddler. By the time he was in his early
      20s he was already teaching painting and had taken trips to Europe
      to study the art.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1859, he made his first
      trip &quot;out West&quot; with Col. Frederick Lander's military
      expedition on the Overland Trail. He returned to New York and
      immediately began translating his rough sketches into soaring
      canvases that attempted to capture the grandeur and drama of
      the American West for his eastern audience.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Indeed, because much
      of the continent remained still relatively unexplored at that
      time, Bierstadt's monumental renderings of stately mountains
      and cascading waterfalls created romantic visions of wanderlust
      in the minds of Easterners,&quot; writes Rutgers art University
      art historian Matthew Baigall, who wrote an artistic biography
      of Albert Bierstadt. &quot; His first public exhibition of these
      works in 1860 was a resounding success. Many critics deemed the
      viewing of his depictions as an almost 'religious' experience,
      associating his mountain spires with majestic cathedrals, his
      luminous skies with the awesome power of God.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That success was immediately
      seen in the marketplace where Bierstadt paintings fetched up
      to $25,000 each, more than had been ever spent on a painting
      up to that time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bierstadt made additional trips
      into the West and Southwest. For a time, he lived in San Francisco
      but then moved back East because of the illness of his wife.
      He made additional trips to Europe and in 1889 took a train to
      British Columbia before heading to Alaska on the Ancon. During
      his trip, he wrote to his wife he had filled two full books with
      sketches and make 60 color studies, but only a couple of the
      studies and neither of the sketch books has survived.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Bierstadt painting is certainly
      the most famous image of the Ancon aground at Loring, but it
      is not the only one. Quite a few photographs were taken and at
      least one other painting was made.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Charles Christian Eisele (1854
      - 1919) also painted the scene and a <A HREF="http://vilda.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/viewer.exe?CISOROOT=/cdmg21&CISOPTR=287&CISORESTMP=&CISOVIEWTMP">copy
      of his work is in the Alaska State Archives</A>. It focuses on
      the surroundings of the wreck, showing several cabins on the
      beach and a large Native canoe nearby. The Ancon is seen on its
      side at the center of the painting, but is not particularly prominent.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Eisele painting portrays
      a small boat approaching the stricken Ancon. The background shows
      a long bay behind the stricken ship but it looks more like the
      head rather than the mouth of Naha Bay meaning that Eisele perhaps
      did the painting equivalent of &quot;flipping the negative&quot;
      in his depiction of the scene in order to make the background
      more striking.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Eisele (who frequently painted
      as Christian or C. Eisele) was a German itinerant painter who
      came to the US in 1869. He worked in Utah and Colorado for many
      years before moving to Oregon toward the end of his life. It's
      not known if he ever actually visited Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The wreck of the Ancon also
      had a ripple effect on the opposite side of the continent in
      the community of Pelham in Westchester County outside of New
      York City.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Benjamin Fairchild was another
      passenger on the Ancon when it went aground. He would later serve
      five separate terms in Congress over a 30 year period from the
      mid 1890s to the mid 1920s, but also have the dubious record
      of being defeated for re-election each time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fairchild developed the area
      called Pelham Heights in the early 1890s when the memory of his
      Alaskan adventure and the &quot;Ancon&quot; were fresh in his
      mind. Pelham Heights contains streets named both Loring and Ancon,
      as well as Elder, which was the ship that came to Loring to rescue
      the stranded passengers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When it was completed, &quot;The
      Wreck of the Ancon at Loring Bay, Alaska&quot; was not seen as
      a major milestone in the life of Bierstadt, he was already famous
      and the Ancon was much smaller and more monochromatic than his
      earlier paintings.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the early 1890s, his art
      was actually in a period of less prominence because his &quot;idealized&quot;
      realism was seen as somewhat inferior artistically to the Impressionistic
      work that was coming out of Europe in the 1880s. It was also
      becoming clear as more Americans were traveling out West that
      Bierstadt's &quot;spectacular&quot; style was not the reality
      of the West they thought it was.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One of the reasons that Bierstadt
      went to Alaska was that - like many landscape artists - he saw
      it was new territory that was still exotic to most Americans
      having only been purchased from the Russians two decades earlier.
      The problem was that the medium of photography was becoming a
      more prominent form of landscape art.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Even after returning to New
      York from Alaska, Bierstadt was unable to generate much interest
      in his work. He continued to fall out of favor and he eventually
      declared bankruptcy because none of his new paintings were selling.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Bierstadt died in 1902. After
      his death, his reputation improved dramatically and he is now
      considered by many to be the foremost American landscape painter
      of the 19th Century.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">His image of the Ancon wrecked
      at Loring, is one of his most popularly re-produced pictures.
      A quick survey on the Internet shows that you can get the image
      on posters, reproduced oil paintings, coffee mugs and computer
      mouse pads among other items.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most art critics consider it
      somewhat atypical of Bierstadt's work. It is more somber and
      lacks the soaring grandiosity of most of his earlier paintings.
      Its relative &quot;bleakness&quot; is now seen as a window into
      the artist's soul as he watched his popularity wane.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ancon painting remained
      unsold at the artist's death in 1902. The Bierstadt estate put
      it in a gallery in Brooklyn where it remained until 1913 when
      it was finally sold to collector. It passed through the hands
      of several collectors until it was purchased by Maxim Karolik,
      a flamboyant Russian opera star who married an American millionairess
      and became the &quot;most conspicuous collector of 19th century
      American art,&quot; according to a Time magazine article in 1962.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Karolik was a great lover of
      all things American and almost singlehandedly generated new interest
      in 19th Century American painting which was out of vogue early
      in the 20th Century.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Time also reported that Karolik
      said he had almost never paid more than $1,000 for any of the
      many Bierstadt, Homer and Hassan paintings he acquired. Today,
      it is not unusual for a Bierstadt painting to bring between $500,000
      and $750,000 at auction. One of his idealized &quot;Old Faithful&quot;
      paintings sold for $665,000 in Santa Fe in December of 2006.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Karolik made a deal with the
      Museum of Fine Arts in Boston that he would give nearly his entire
      collection to the MFA - some 3,000 items of art and decorative
      furniture - if it would agree to display large portions of it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1945, the MFA received Bierstadt's
      &quot;Ancon&quot; painting - along with a dozen other Bierstadt
      works - and continues to display it to this day.</FONT></P>
