      Ketchikan, Alaska - One hundred and twenty-five years ago , the
      United States Navy - then the only governmental authority in
      Alaska - shelled and burned the village of Angoon after a dispute
      and an alleged hostage situation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Even in the late 19th Century
      when America had been at &quot;war&quot; with many of the Native
      peoples of western North America for two generations, the shelling
      of Angoon was controversial. The shelling also directly led to
      the eventual removal of military control of the district of Alaska
      and the creation of a limited local government in what would
      eventually become the 49th state.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Navy and Native accounts of the shelling agree on one thing -
      that the death of a Native on a whaling ship led to the bombing
      of the village. But much of the rest of the &quot;facts&quot;
      are shrouded by the miscommunication that frequently clouded
      interactions between Alaska Natives and the American Government.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the case of the Angoon shelling
      the US government later disavowed the decision making that led
      to the bombing and called the incident a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was a misunderstanding that
      the village Natives say had fatal consequences.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Earlier Bombings in
      Kake and Wrangell</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The bombing of Angoon followed
      a pattern the American military had established not long after
      the US took possession of Alaska from Russia in 1867.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In January of 1869, a party
      of Natives from Kake decided to leave Sitka and return home.
      For reasons that were not recorded, the military authorities
      forbade them to leave and ordered the sentries to detain them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A scuffle broke out and one
      of the Natives was killed. Then the group of Tlingits was then
      allowed to return to Kake.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But on their way back, the
      group came across two miners, Ludwig Madger and William Walker,
      camped in a small cove (later named Murder Cove) near Point Gardiner
      on Admiralty Island. The miners were killed and their remains
      mutilated.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When word of the killings got
      back to Sitka, the armed vessel Saginaw under the command of
      Lt. Commander Meade was sent to Kake. It proceeded to shell Kake,
      destroying most of the buildings. It also shelled two smaller
      villages nearby.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No Native casualties were reported,
      primarily because the villages had been forewarned and were evacuated.
      But most of their canoes were destroyed and the Kake natives
      were forced to disperse to other villages. It would be two decades
      before the village of Kake would reconstitute itself, according
      to information on a State Of Alaska Commerce and Economic Development
      website.</FONT></P>

      &quot;I attribute this wholesome fear of whites to the thorough
      punishment given by Lt. Commander Meade in 1869,&quot; wrote
      the Alaskan Naval Commander Lester Beardslee in 1871. &quot;The
      story of which, greatly exaggerated, has spread throughout the
      country and has produced the most beneficial results.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The US Army was also involved
      in a shelling, later in 1869.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">George Thornton Emmons, a US
      Naval officer in Alaska from 1882 to 1899, and later one the
      first ethnographers to study Alaska Natives, wrote about the
      Wrangell incident in &quot;The Tlingit Indians&quot; his masterwork,
      which was written in the 1930s and 1940s but not published until
      1991.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The shelling of Wrangell
      in 1869 by the Army at Fort Wrangel was ordered to enforce the
      surrender of an Indian named Scutdoo or Scutdor who had killed
      a White trader in retaliation for the wanton and unjustifiable
      killing of an Indian name Si-Wau by Lt. Loucks the second in
      command of the post,&quot; Emmons wrote. &quot;Si Wau was drunk
      at the time and had bitten off part of a finger of (another soldier's)
      wife.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Emmons noted that Scutdoo was
      a cousin of Si Wau and felt duty bound to kill a white to avenge
      the death. The Army shelled a large portion of the Indian village
      and then took Scutdoo's mother and another Native hostage. Scutdoo
      gave himself up and was tried, convicted and hanged for the murder.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Emmons reported that before
      the execution Scutdoo expressed sorrow over the killing and said
      he had nothing personal against the dead trader and he hoped
      to meet up with him in the afterlife.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Native Was Killed
      on Whaling Ship&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The situation that led to the
      Shelling of Angoon on Oct. 26, 1882 - some 13 years after the
      earlier incidents - began with a harpoon gun exploded on a whaling
      ship operated by the Northwest Trading Company which had a herring
      and whale reduction plant at Killisnoo, just south of the Tlingit
      village of Angoon on the west side of Admiralty Island facing
      Chatham Strait.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The whaling ship was attempting
      to take a whale out in the Strait on Oct. 22 when the gun exploded
      spraying the crewmen with fragments. One struck and killed Tith
      Klane, a medicine man from Angoon, according to the Kootznawoo
      Heritage Foundation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Klane was killed and other
      Native crewmen took his body ashore. Then the &quot;misunderstandings&quot;
      began to occur.</FONT></P>

      Cutter Corwin<BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      According to a report to the US. Congress in late November of
      1882 by Lt. M.A. Healy the commanding officer of the Sitka-based
      Revenue Cutter Corwin, the superintendent of the whaling station
      at Killisnoo, J.M. Vanderbilt, arrived in Sitka on Oct. 23 -
      the day after Klane's death - and told Navy officials that he
      feared for his safety because the Angoon natives had essentially
      &quot;taken over&quot; the Killisnoo station, demanding a repayment
      of 200 blankets for the life of Klane. Vanderbilt also claimed
      that two white employees of the company had been taken hostage
      by the villagers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;If the demand (for the
      reparations) was not met the natives threatened to burn the company's
      store and buildings, destroy its boats and put to death the white
      prisoners,&quot; Healy reported that the Navy was told by the
      whaling station superintendent.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Capt. E.C. Merriman, the commander
      of the largest navy ship in Alaska, the USS Adams, then ordered
      the Corwin and a whaling company tugboat called the Favorite
      - which was armed for the mission - to respond to the situation.
      Merriman later said he felt the Adams would be too large to effectively
      maneuver in the shallow waters near the village.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Healy reported that after anchoring
      the white men who were being held were released &quot;some of
      the ring leading Indians captured and the release of the property
      effected.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then Merriman - perhaps wanting
      to make a &quot;statement&quot; in the manner of the early Kake
      and Wrangell shellings - upped the ante, according to Healy,
      and demanded that the Natives turn over 400 blankets to Navy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Healy reported that the Navy
      threatened to destroy the village if the demand was not met.
      He said when the Natives didn't meet the demand (Angoon records
      state that the villages offered 82 blankets), some forty canoes
      were destroyed and the village was shelled and burned.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Healy's report was further
      buttressed by a second report that was sent to Congress, this
      from William Morris, the federal revenue collector in Sitka.
      Morris contended that the Navy had acted appropriately.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It has been a custom
      for many years in this territory when an Indian has been killed
      by another, or by a white man for his surviving relatives to
      demand at the hands of the parties who injured him a certain
      tribute, consisting generally of blankets,&quot; Morris wrote
      to the Secretary of the Treasury on Oct. 28, 1882. &quot;The
      Hoochenoos are a rich and warlike tribe, very insolent and saucy
      towards the whitesAs long as the native tribes throughout the
      archipelago do not feel the force and are not punished for flagrant
      outrages, so much the more dangerous they becomethe punishment
      has been most severe, but eminently most salutatory.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In January, Capt. Merriman
      also sent a report to Congress, via the Secretary of the Treasury,
      Charles Folger.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Merriman's account generally
      followed the same trajectory as the reports of Healy and Morris,
      but added interesting details regarding the &quot;negotiations&quot;
      with the Native leaders , particularly regarding a meeting with
      Angoon leaders &quot;Kenalkos&quot; and &quot;Loginon Jake&quot;
      that happened after the village was burned.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I told them in substance
      what I had said before, that while the government felt friendly
      to them and wanted them to till the soil and fish and hunt, and
      would protect them in pursuing their peaceful avocations, it
      would put down with a rigorous hand any attempt to seize and
      injure white men or their property,&quot; Merriman wrote. &quot;They
      replied that they would never attempt to do anything of the kind
      again; that the old men and chiefs had tried to restrain the
      young men, but were unable to do so; that as a lesson to the
      young men and the squaws, they were glad that I had burned the
      village.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Merriman also reported that
      not all the houses or the canoes had been destroyed, only the
      ones belonging to the villagers who had not cooperated with the
      Navy.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;They Left Us Homeless
      On the Beach&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Naturally, the tribal memory
      at Angoon differs from the official version of the US military.
      In 1982, the 100th anniversary of the shelling, Angoon tribal
      elders agreed that the eye witness of account of Billy Jones,
      who was 13 when the attack occurred, should be the basis of the
      Angoon story, according to &quot;In Commemoration&quot; the official
      publication of the Kootznoowoo Heritage Foundation on the centennial
      anniversary, </FONT><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jones, a nephew of Tith Klane,
      told his story to pioneering Alaskan anthropologist Frederica
      de Laguna in 1949 and 1950 when he was in early 70s.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jones told de Laguna that the
      villagers didn't have any warning about the arrival of the Navy
      ships. They were on the beach putting up the fall herring run
      when the &quot;huge black ship&quot; steamed into Kootznahoo
      Inlet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Soon, white men came ashore
      and took two of the tribal leaders back to the ship with them.
      Jones said the white men were shouting but that he and most of
      the Angoon Natives couldn't understand what they were saying.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A short time later, more &quot;men
      in uniforms&quot; came back ashore and began gathering all the
      Angoon canoes together. Then they began to smash the canoes.
      They also took seven more villagers on board the ship for a total
      of nine &quot;captives,&quot; Jones said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jones told de Laguna that the
      next morning the ship left the inlet and went out in Chatham
      Strait so it was facing directly at the long houses on the beach
      crescent. Then it began to shell the houses. Meanwhile, crewmembers
      from a second boat landed at tribal storehouses in a nearby bay
      and set fire to them, Jones said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After the long houses had been
      knocked down the shells, crewmen rowed ashore with coal oil and
      set fire to the remains, Jones said. The sailors also began to
      take ceremonial items, blankets and furs, but when the villagers
      protested, the sailors trained guns on them, so they retreated,
      Jones said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;They left us homeless
      on the beach,&quot; de Laguna quoted Jones as saying later.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jones also told the anthropologist
      that his mother told him that smoke from the fires suffocated
      six village children. With winter coming on, the villagers were
      in a desperate situation, Jones said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The people of Angoon
      nearly starved to death, all of them,&quot; he told de Laguna.
      &quot;How much we suffered.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jones said the villagers made
      temporary shelters and searched the beaches at low tide for anything
      they could eat; shellfish, gumboots, even the parts of fish left
      over from sea lion kills. Jones said it was nearly five years
      before the village recovered.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The shelling immediately caused
      a stir in Congress which - even though it was just six years
      removed from the Seventh Calvary 'massacre' at the Little Big
      Horn - was beginning to question the validity of how the US military
      had been treating Native Americans in recent decades.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There was discussion in Congress
      about an official investigation into the bombing, but no investigation
      was undertaken. There were - however - newspaper reports in both
      Seattle and San Francisco that questioned the Navy's view of
      the events and strongly suggested that the military acted without
      justification at Angoon.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Military Removed From
      Control&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two years later, in 1884, steps
      were taken to remove Alaska from under military control. In the
      Alaska Organic Act of 1884, Congress allowed for a limited form
      of local civilian government to take root. The act called for
      a district of Alaska court system, school system and a small
      administrative branch existing primarily of a &quot;governor&quot;
      and few other officials. The military would remain in Alaska
      but only in a support, rather than in a governmental function.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The main force behind the Alaska
      Organic Act was a Congressman from California named James Budd
      who clearly was still angry over the Navy's treatment of the
      Angoon villagers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It has been asked 'what
      laws are enforced there and how?' Budd railed during the House
      floor debate on the measure on May 13, 1884. &quot;The laws have
      been the changeable wills of the United States officers and enforced
      in such manner as to them appear proper. In their hands, strange
      as it may seem, have been the powers of taking life, liberty
      and property without the restraint or forms of law.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Budd then recounted a San Francisco
      Chronicle report of the events and of Merriman's counter demand
      of 400 blankets.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The Indians did not comply
      with this peremptory order of this royal dictator,&quot; Budd
      proclaimed. &quot;I understand they did not have the blankets.
      The commander of this United States vessel was a law unto himself,
      and in the morning, he, a United States officer, judge, jury
      and sheriff, fulfilled his threat and shelled the Indian village.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By the early 1970s, there was
      a greater awareness of Native rights in America and the Angoon
      Tlingits joined many other tribes seeking redress of past wrongs.
      The Tlingit and Haida Central Council pressed the Angoon case
      before the Indian Claims Commission.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It hired anthropologist Phillip
      Drucker to research the case. Drucker presented an 84-page report
      in which he went over the official accounts on the incident.
      He noted the contradictions between the white and Native accounts,
      but most notably he found that the issue of the &quot;captive
      white men&quot; that spurred the expedition from Sitka in the
      first place seemed to disappear the minute the Corwin and Favorite
      reached Angoon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Drucker noted that the rescue
      was the &quot;prime mission of the expedition&quot; but that
      neither Merriman or Morris &quot;even mentions what should have
      been the climax of the expedition's achievements, the rescue
      of the white captives, if there actually was such a rescue.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But just nine days before Angoon
      was to make its case to federal authorities - on June 18, 1973,
      the government offered to settle the case. Federal law prevented
      the village from getting any compensation beyond the tribal and
      clan property that was destroyed, and that value was basedon
      the 1882 value of the property.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On the advice of their attorneys,
      the residents of Angoon chose to settle and accept a $90,000
      payment from the government. The attorneys also noted that the
      settlement was a tacit acknowledgement that the Navy had been
      wrong to shell Angoon in the first place.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Oct. 26, 1982, Alaskan Governor
      Jay Hammond signed a proclamation commemorating the centennial
      of the bombing by creating &quot;Tlingit Commemoration Day&quot;
      and the state Legislature also passed a resolution commemorating
      the anniversary and supporting Angoon efforts to get a full apology
      from the federal government.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Representatives of the village
      traveled to Washington D.C. to seek a formal apology from the
      Navy but were rebuffed. The best the Navy would offer was a concession
      that the attack should never have occurred. Sen. Frank Murkowski
      of Alaska inserted the account of the the bombing by Billy Jones
      into the Congressional Record in hopes of counteracting the official
      Navy position that the reports of Merriman, Healy and Morris
      constituted the official record on the &quot;shelling.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the mid 1990s, Governor
      Tony Knowles asked the Clinton Adminstration to formally apologize
      for the bombing, but there was no official response from Washington</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In January of 1999, a beaver
      figurehead from one of the Angoon canoes that was destroyed in
      the attack was found in a collection at the Museum of Natural
      History in New York City. It was repatriated - amid great ceremony
      - to the village for display in an eventual heritage center.<BR>
