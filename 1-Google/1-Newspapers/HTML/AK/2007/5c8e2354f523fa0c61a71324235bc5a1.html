      Between his first and second round of killings, gunman Cho Seung-Hui
      went to the local post office and express-mailed a packet of
      photos, a video and a rambling, often incoherent 22-page screed
      attempting to justify the execution of his classmates.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After clearing it with police,
      NBC News began airing brief excerpts Wednesday night and has
      taken considerable heat for doing so. It must have been devastating
      to the victims' loved ones to see the boastful killer posturing
      with his handguns. And even NBC's own consultant, former FBI
      agent Clint Van Zandt, said that airing the video was Cho's &quot;ultimate
      victory ... reaching out from the grave and grabbing us.&quot;

      Difficult as the decision was for NBC, it was the right one,
      reached after a long day of soul-searching. NBC was thoughtful
      and careful about what it chose to present and it did so in a
      manner that was not sensational or exploitive.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Cho's final thoughts are essential
      to understanding what otherwise is inexplicable. The packet is
      a dark glimpse into a mind that is truly unhinged.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Only from the video can the
      depth of his narcissism, anger and sense of grievance be apparent:
      &quot;You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided
      today. But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into
      a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours.
      Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Jesus Christ, he said, &quot;loved
      inducing cancer in my head, terrorizing my heart and ripping
      my soul all this time.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the aftermath of the Virginia
      Tech massacre, the usual pop explanations quickly arose - a flawed
      culture, America's quick resort to violence, the ready availability
      of guns. But Cho himself provided the most convincing explanation.
      He was, to use a layman's term, insane.</FONT></P>
