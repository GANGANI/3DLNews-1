      Juneau, Alaska - International fisheries law enforcement operations
      resulted in the interception of two Chinese fishing boats suspected
      of high-seas driftnet fishing in the North Pacific Ocean.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">High seas driftnets are banned
      by a UN General Assembly Resolution; these fishing nets are over
      a mile and a half in length, and they indiscriminately catch
      massive amounts of fish and other marine life by means of suspension
      in open waters.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On September 24, a Coast Guard
      HH-65 helicopter, deployed from Coast Guard Cutter Boutwell,
      reportedly observed Zhe Dai Yuan Yu 1961 concealing net spreaders.
      Once boarded by a Joint U.S./Chinese Boarding Team from the Boutwell,
      the master of the vessel admitted to having two groups of nets
      approximately 18,000 to 21,000 feet in length.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Both the Zhe Dai Yuan Yu 1961
      and Lu Rong Yu 1961 reportedly contained squid, shark fins and
      various other marine life. These vessels were confirmed to be
      registered in the People's Republic of China and were taken into
      custody by a Chinese fisheries officer who was onboard the USCG
      Cutter Boutwell. The fishing vessels were then escorted to the
      Tsugaru Straight and transferred today to the Chinese Fisheries
      Law Enforcement Command Vessel 202.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">These illegal driftnets were
      also spotted on board the Lu Rong Yu 1961 during a separate boarding
      Monday. The vessel had also attempted to disguise its name and
      origin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to information provided
      by the USCG, high-seas driftnet enforcement cooperation between
      China, United States, Japan, Canada, Russia and Korea over the
      past years has resulted in a dramatic decrease in large-scale,
      high-seas driftnet activity in the North Pacific.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;A handful of illegal
      driftnet fishermen can cause disproportionate damage to overstressed
      North Pacific Fisheries because the driftnet is so environmentally
      devastating,&quot; said Capt. Michael Inman, Chief of Response,
      17th Coast Guard Distict.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On September 6, Boutwell intercepted
      the vessel Lu Rong Yu 6007 for high-seas driftnet fishing and
      turned that vessel over to Chinese authorities September 13.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The United States is party
      to a number of multilateral and bilateral international agreements
      to prevent and deter illegal driftnet fishing on the world commons
      of the high seas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The USCG Cutter Boutwell Boutwell
      is 378-foot high endurance cutter based in Alameda, Calif., currently
      operating under the tactical control of the 17th Coast Guard
      District headquartered in Juneau, Alaska. The Boutwell is currently
      deployed as a U.S. Coast Guard representative in the North Pacific
      Coast Guard Forum (NPCGF). This forum was developed to combat
      illegal fishing and increase international maritime safety and
      security on the Northern Pacific Ocean and its borders.</FONT></P>
