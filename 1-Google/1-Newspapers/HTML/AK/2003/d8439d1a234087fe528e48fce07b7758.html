      Deer</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      Tuesday - 12:45 am</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      In what is believed to be the first success of its kind, researchers
      at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&amp;M University
      have cloned a white-tailed deer. A fawn, named &quot;Dewey,&quot;
      after Duane Kraemer, one of the researchers, was born to a surrogate
      mother several months ago.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The fawn is believed to be
      the first successfully cloned deer and Texas A&amp;M is the first
      academic institution in the world to have cloned five different
      species. Previously, researchers at the College of Veterinary
      Medicine have cloned cattle, goats, pigs and a cat.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The announcement of the successful
      deer cloning was delayed until DNA analysis could be performed
      to confirm genetic identity. This breakthrough in deer cloning
      at the College of Veterinary Medicine was a joint project with
      Viagen, Inc. and may be useful in conserving endangered deer
      species including the Key West deer of Florida, researchers say.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Dewey is developing normally
      for a fawn his age and appears healthy,&quot; said Dr. Mark Westhusin,
      who holds a joint appointment with the Colleges of Veterinary
      Medicine and Agriculture and Life Sciences and is the lead investigator
      on the project.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;A DNA analysis confirmed
      that Dewey is a clone, i.e. a genetic copy of the donor,&quot;
      adding that &quot;future scientific advances resulting from the
      successful cloning of the deer are expected.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The clone was produced using
      fibroblast cells which were isolated from skin samples derived
      from a deceased white-tailed buck, expanded in culture then frozen
      and stored in liquid nitrogen. White-tailed deer oocytes were
      collected from ovaries of does and matured in vitro.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two teams of research scientists
      led by Westhusin and Dr. Duane (Dewey) Kraemer of Texas A&amp;M
      University and Dr. Charles Long of Viagen Inc. performed the
      nuclear transfer procedures and transfer of the cloned embryos.
      Dewey is under the medical care of Dr. Alice Blue-McClendon,
      a veterinarian at the College of Veterinary Medicine.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;With each new species
      cloned, we learn more about how this technology might be applied
      to improving the health of animals and humans,&quot; said Westhusin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In December 2001, the first
      cloned cat was born at the College of Veterinary Medicine. Other
      cloned animals born at the university include several litters
      of pigs, a Boer goat, a disease-resistant Angus bull, and the
      first Brahma bull.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The knowledge we gain
      from cloning these animals could greatly affect several areas
      of science and medicine,&quot; said H. Richard Adams, dean of
      the College of Veterinary Medicine. &quot;With each successful
      cloned species, we learn more about cloning procedures and how
      to make the process more efficient.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">White-tailed deer represent
      the most abundant, wide-spread big game animal in North America.
      They are popular game animals and are prized for their meat and
      antlers. Deer farming to produce meat and antlers is common in
      many parts of the world, including Texas. When breeding animals
      die or are harvested as a result of hunting, cloning may provide
      a valuable tool for conserving the genetics of superior animals.</FONT></P>
