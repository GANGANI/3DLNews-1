      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fifty years later, it's difficult
      to believe such things happened in Ketchikan. The newspaper stories,
      datelined December 1953 and January 1954, read like fiction and
      reveal details of one of the sleaziest chapters in the town's
      history.</FONT></P>

      On January 4, 1954, after weeks of hearings and witnesses and
      testimonies, the Grand Jury submitted its final report to District
      Court Judge George Folta.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At the beginning of the hearings
      Folta, a straightforward no-nonsense judge, told the jury he
      wanted a thorough investigation of vice and corruption in local
      government. &quot;You are the bulwark between the public and
      the lawbreakers,&quot; he told the jurors.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Weeks later the judge accepted
      the final report, and expressed his satisfaction to the jury.
      &quot;The public owes you a debt of gratitude,&quot; he told
      them. Most likely the report more than satisfied Folta because
      it:</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">How Did Ketchikan
      Get Into This Mess?</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The &quot;oldest profession&quot;
      came to town around 1900 and established itself just north of
      today's tunnel in the area then known as &quot;Newtown,&quot;
      according to historian/author Patricia Roppel.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In those days, Ketchikan was
      a rough, frontier village inhabited mostly by men-miners, fishermen,
      and sawmill and cannery workers-who tended to gravitate toward
      saloons and brothels.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As the town grew and prospered,
      the red-light district kept pace. As law-abiding citizens began
      to complain about noise and rowdy neighbors, the newly formed
      city council flexed its muscles and ordered all madams and prostitutes
      to move to the south side of Ketchikan Creek. That was in March
      of 1903.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Soon small clapboard houses
      and shacks appeared along the creek. Early photographs show that
      over each small house hung a large globe, engraved with the names
      of its residents.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although difficult to tell
      from the photos, some of the names may have included Margot,

      </TABLE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Blanche, Audrey, Nell
      and Stella-these were some of the women who lived on the creek
      in 1919 and signed their names to a list of contributors to the
      Fourth-of-July celebration.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By 1920, according to Roppel,
      at least 21 brothels with 37 prostitutes operated on what was
      now officially referred to as Creek Street.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">City officials soon found it
      necessary to impose rules on the red-light district. The women
      could not shop downtown after six in the evening; they could
      not walk down the street en masse, but only alone or in pairs;
      they could not visit and socialize with each other after four
      o'clock in the afternoon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Despite such restrictions,
      business on the creek boomed. Soon the bawdy houses, bootleg
      joints and card rooms spread to Barney Way and Stedman Street,
      to Main and Mission and all over town.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The times were wild and today
      old-timers love to talk about them. Stories are told of &quot;rumrunners&quot;
      who delivered booze to creek-side whorehouses and other &quot;blind
      pigs&quot; and speak-easies around town; and of bootleggers who
      smuggled liquor from Prince Rupert, stashed it on Gravina or
      Pennock, and later brought it to town in rowboats and unloaded
      it through trap doors. Stories are told about &quot;moon-shiners&quot;
      and stills, bathtubs of &quot;mash&quot; and bottles of home
      brew. And about the empty bottles that drifted nightly down the
      creek and washed into Thomas Basinnot to mention the occasional
      body or two!</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Ketchikan
      Is Wicked&quot;</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is no wonder that by 1925
      Ketchikan had earned a bad reputation.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Senator Hunt Says Ketchikan's
      Wicked!&quot; headlined the Ketchikan Alaska Chronicle on April
      24, 1925. According to the newspaper, Senator Forest J. Hunt
      stated on the floor of the territorial senate that &quot;Ketchikan
      Alaska is a terrible town. It is vice-ridden and corrupt. One
      might even gather that it is about the worst place in the world.&quot;
      Shocking testimony, given that Senator Hunt lived in Ketchikan
      and considered it his hometown!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The town's reputation spread.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1926 the Los Angeles Examiner
      ran an article about &quot;gamblers, liquor dealers, and red-light
      women&quot; in Ketchikan. The Examiner stated that vice in Alaska's
      First City was &quot;defiant&quot; and &quot;arrogant,&quot;
      and the town was &quot;the worst pest hole in America.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The unwanted publicity led
      to an uprising of local citizens, many of whom were mothers concerned
      about raising their families in such a deplorable place. The
      citizens sent a petition to Washington, D.C.: &quot;Bootleggers
      are all around us; almost every taxi carries liquor; sporting
      girls are in houses next to ours. We have appealed to the city
      officers </FONT><TABLE WIDTH="187" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In response, a federal grand
      jury held hearings in Juneau and found that in Ketchikan &quot;the
      prohibition force is lacking in numbers to carry on its work&quot;
      and recommended another deputy marshal and an assistant district
      attorney be stationed here permanently, according to a 1926 Chronicle
      article.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The promised attorney arrived-an
      aggressive man named Howard Douglas Stabler, who went after houses
      of vice with a vengeance. &quot;Bawdy Houses Face Nemesis Says
      Stabler&quot; read a Chronicle headline. Stabler apparently conducted
      a one-man abatement campaign, closing down brothels, bootleg
      joints and taxi companies.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yet his efforts did not last
      and within a few years, 33 houses were open for business on the
      creek.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Creek Street
      Is Open Again&quot;</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Though World War II again closed
      the red-light district briefly, by the end of the war it was
      back in business, full steam ahead.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1948, the Ketchikan Ministerial
      Association wrote a letter to the City Council: &quot;Creek Street
      is open again.&quot; Expressing a concern for young people of
      the community, the local ministers pleaded with the council to
      do something about vice.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1952, the U.S. Coast Guard,
      concerned about the health and well-being of its men at Base
      Ketchikan, contacted an agency called the American Social Hygiene
      Association (A.S.H.A.) and requested an investigation of venereal
      disease and drug addiction on Creek Street.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In its subsequent report, the
      A.S.H.A. found that vice and corruption in Ketchikan was worse
      than in 95 percent of other U. S. cities. The Association also
      classified the town as &quot;bad&quot; in relationship to prostitution.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The city council responded
      by imposing more rules on the Creek. Longtime Ketchikan business
      man Wally Kubley recalls that in the '50s &quot;the girls had
      to shop and be off the street by twelve noon and if they wanted
      to go to the show, it had to be the second show. And they couldn't
      go in the bars.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Enter Emery Tobin</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Emery Tobin arrived in Ketchikan
      in 1920 at the age of 25. A public-minded citizen, he quickly
      became involved in community affairs. By the 1940s he was well
      known as publisher of the Alaska Sportsman, a Boy Scout leader,
      charter member of the Ketchikan Rotary Club, and someone who
      wanted to reform local government. By this time there were rumors
      everywhere about graft among public officials and police officers
      taking &quot;protection money&quot; from prostitutes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Motivated by local ministers
      and the American Social Hygiene Association, the self-confident
      Tobin called for an investigation of the police department. When
      nothing happened Tobin </FONT><TABLE WIDTH="187" ALIGN="RIGHT"

      writing letters-to-the-editor, speaking out in public and attacking
      prostitutes, gamblers, bootleggers, cab drivers, certain policemen
      and politicians.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But Tobin could be abrasive
      and offensive, and many people did not agree with him.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;It don't hurt
      Mr. Tobin&quot;</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One person Tobin offended was
      Creek Street resident Annie Watkins, who began writing letters
      of her own. &quot;I don't think whatever is on Creek Street,
      it don't hurt Mr. Tobin,&quot; Watkins wrote to the editor of
      the Ketchikan Daily News. &quot;I am sure Mr. Tobin don't visit
      anyone on Creek Street. After all a man like him wouldn't because
      we are just the poor underdog and a target to be shot at.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Longtime Ketchikan resident
      L. L. Winnie also disagreed with Tobin and wrote that Creek Street
      &quot;is not an evil but a necessity, an outlet for the hell
      with which we were born.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another citizen advocated that
      Ketchikan solve its prostitution problem by becoming a &quot;blue
      law town;&quot; in other words, giving prostitutes and other
      &quot;undesirables&quot; blue tickets and shipping them out of
      town.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Both the Ketchikan Alaska Chronicle
      and the Ketchikan Daily News published letters-to-the-editor
      on both sides of the issue and then added their own editorial
      views-on opposite sides.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Publisher of the Chronicle,
      Bill Baker, wrote anti-Tobin editorials, while Sid Charles, publisher
      of the Ketchikan Daily News, supported Tobin's clean-up campaign.
      &quot;Word must not go out that this is a 'loose town,'&quot;
      Charles warned in a 1949 editorial, &quot;especially in view
      of [future] pulp mill development.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By the time the Grand Jury
      convened in the fall of 1953, feelings were running strong. The
      Daily News published an editorial supporting strong-willed Judge
      Folta, who over the years had expressed frustration with previous
      grand juries that did nothing but &quot;rubber stamp&quot; recommendations
      of corrupt city and federal officials.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This time Folta meant business
      and everyone knew it. When the 1953 grand jury attempted to submit
      another &quot;rubber stamp&quot; report and adjourn, Folta called
      them back into session. He demanded they take as much time as
      needed to get the job done.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;This has become a showdown
      battle between the good people of Ketchikan and the crooks,&quot;
      the judge added for emphasis.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Daily News picked up the
      quote and highlighted it in great bold type.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When the Dust Settled:
      Repercussions</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When dust from the hearings
      settled the police chief and captain both pled guilty to reduced
      charges-conspiracy to permit prostitution-and left town. The
      district attorney remained in Ketchikan, but resigned his government
      position and went into private practice.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">True to his self-confident
      nature Emery Tobin, in a 1965 taped interview, claimed sole credit
      for being &quot;the leader of an investigation which resulted
      in an almost 100 percent clean up of law enforcement agencies
      [in Ketchikan]. Seven bawdy-house operators had their places
      abated and the red-light district was abolished.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The city council toughened up and cracked down on crime, instituting
      new regulations on cab drivers and making it more difficult to
      obtain and renew liquor licenses.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ketchikan Ministerial Association
      determined that the 1953-54 Grand Jury hearings accomplished
      a lot, but did not go far enough. The ministers called for another
      investigation and additional hearings into who owned (and was
      benefiting from) buildings that were still being used for illegal
      gambling, bootlegging and prostitution, according to the Ketchikan
      Daily News.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And there were other dissenting
      voices. In a 1956 letter-to-the-editor, Creek Street resident
      Annie Watkins took Tobin to task: &quot;If some of our citizens
      would mind their own business and stop running around, up and
      down the streets, trying to make trouble without a cause, people
      could live in peace.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Watkins went on to say that
      Creek Street may be &quot;cleaned up&quot; but the girls were
      still around. &quot;You have squashed the mud and it flew all
      over town,&quot; she wrote. And with much passion Watkins defended
      residents like herself who continued to live on the creek: &quot;We
      too have a soul, heart and feeling.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To this day old-timers remember
      and take sides. &quot;Tobin was against anything that was any
      fun,&quot; recalls longtime Ketchikan resident Mary (Berry) Van
      Winkle. Though Van Winkle says this with a chuckle, her tone
      is serious. Many of the &quot;girls&quot; were good people who
      did a lot to help others, she says.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Walt Bolling, who served on
      the local police force in 1953 and lives in Ketchikan today,
      summed up the times by saying they were both good and bad and
      the people involved were both good and bad. The times were &quot;controversial,&quot;
      he says, &quot;but the people were just like us. They didn't
      want violence anymore than anyone else did.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At least the shocking headlines
      of vice and corruption are gone and Ketchikan's reputation has
      improved considerably.</FONT></P>
