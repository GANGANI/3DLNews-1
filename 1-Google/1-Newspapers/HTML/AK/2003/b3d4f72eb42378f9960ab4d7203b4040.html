      </TABLE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Retreat.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Nick is going to be a
      welcome addition to the Republican majority. He brings a wealth
      of business experience to the table, and that's going to be needed
      this legislative session,&quot; Kott said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Stepovich represents Fairbanks
      and replaces Jim Whitaker who was recently elected mayor of the
      Fairbanks North Star Borough. Stepovich believes his family's
      history in alaskan politics has prepared him for the position.
      He said, &quot;People sit around the breakfast or lunch table
      all across the state, and they discuss issues that they want
      to do something about. Well, now I get the chance, and that's
      exciting.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Committee assignments were
      also a focus of the retreat. Representative Hugh &quot;Bud&quot;
      Fate (R-Fairbanks) left his chairmanship of the House Resources
      Committee for a position on the House Finance Committee. Representative
      Nancy Dahlstrom (R-Eagle River) and Representative Beverly Masek
      (R-Wasilla) were named co-chairs of the House Resources Committee,
      and Representative Jim Holm (R-Fairbanks) became sole chair of
      the Transportation Committee.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Of Rep. Fate's appointment,
      Speaker Kott said, &quot;Bud has a wealth of experience as a
      businessman in the Fairbanks area, and I'm sure he will fill
      a void that was created when Jim [Whitaker] left his position
      in finance.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Representative Fate was equally
      pleased to be selected, &quot;I'm honored to have the position,
      and I think it is important that the interior be represented
      on the Finance Committee.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Speaker Kott was enthusiastic
      about the caucus's selection of Representatives Dahlstrom and
      Masek as resource co-chairs. &quot;This is the first time that
      I can recall that we've had two women as co-chairs. Both are
      very, very familiar with resource development issues. I'm sure
      their going to do a superb job for all Alaskans.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I am really honored that
      the majority has selected me to co-chair the Resources Committee.
      I am eager to move forward on all of the issues we have to deal
      with, whether they are statewide concerns or issues that affect
      local districts.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;As the Governor has said,
      resources are where we are going to pick the pieces up and make
      things run effectively and efficiently in the state. I support
      him in that and look forward to this opportunity to serve the
      State of Alaska,&quot; Representative Dahlstrom said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">With Representative Masek becoming
      co-chair of the Resources Committee, Representative Holm became
      the chair of the Transportation Committee. &quot;I have a number
      of issues I want to address as chair of the Transportation Committee.
      One is to make sure we assert our right-of-ways and that we have
      access and egress to the resources of the state. It is very important.
      I also want to go forward with a natural gasline.&quot;<BR>
