      Corvallis, OR - A new study has concluded that the red sea urchin,
      a small spiny invertebrate that lives in shallow coastal waters,
      is among the longest living animals on Earth - they can live
      to be 100 years old, and some may reach 200 years or more in
      good health with few signs of age.</FONT></P>

      In other words, an individual red sea urchin that hatched on
      the day in 1805 that Lewis and Clark arrived in Oregon may still
      be thriving - and even breeding. The research was just published
      in a professional journal, the <I>U.S. Fishery Bulletin</I>,
      by scientists from Oregon State University and the Lawrence Livermore
      National Laboratory. It may have important implications for management
      of a commercial fishery and our understanding of marine biology,
      as well as challenge some erroneous assumptions about the life
      cycle of this never-say-die marine species.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It used to be believed that
      red sea urchins lived to be only seven to 15 years of age, experts
      say. But the newest findings are based on the use of two completely
      different techniques of determining sea urchin ages - one biochemical
      and the other nuclear - that produced the same results. The studies
      show red sea urchins can have a vast lifespan surpassing that
      of virtually all terrestrial and most marine animal species,
      and seem to show almost no signs of senescence, or age-related
      dysfunction, right up until the day that something kills them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;No animal lives forever,
      but these red sea urchins appear to be practically immortal,&quot;
      said Thomas Ebert, a marine zoologist at OSU. &quot;They can
      die from attacks by predators, specific diseases or being harvested
      by fishermen. But even then they show very few signs of age.
      The evidence suggests that a 100-year-old red sea urchin is just
      as apt to live another year, or reproduce, as a 10-year-old sea
      urchin.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The more mature red sea urchins,
      in fact, appear to be the most prolific producers of sperm and
      eggs, and are perfectly capable of breeding even when incredibly
      old. There is no sea urchin version of menopause.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Some of the new studies on
      this species were done with funding support from the Pacific
      States Fishery Commission to gain more information about the
      species, its life cycle, biology, survival rate, growth patterns,
      and perhaps shed light on why the red sea urchin resource was
      declining in some areas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This small marine animal, which
      is found in shallow Pacific Ocean coastal waters from Alaska
      to Baja California and also elsewhere in the world's oceans,
      lives by grazing quietly on marine plants and deterring most
      predators with its pointy spines. Historically, it had been considered
      a nuisance.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;In the U.S. in the 1960s,
      sea urchins were considered the scourge of the sea, a real menace,&quot;
      Ebert said. &quot;They ate plants in kelp forests and people
      believed they were at least partly responsible for the decline
      of that marine ecosystem, so they tried to poison them, get rid
      of them however possible.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But in the 1970s a commercial
      fishery developed in the U.S. based on sea urchins, which were
      sold primarily to Japan where their sex organs were considered
      a delicacy. They brought high prices, and at one point in the
      1990s were one of the most valuable marine resources in California.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ebert did some early work on
      the red sea urchin, along with colleagues Steve Schroeter at
      the University of California, Santa Barbara, and John Dixon,
      of the California Coastal Commission. It quickly became apparent
      that sea urchins, among other things, grew a lot more slowly
      and lived a lot longer than had been believed. &quot;Sea urchins
      live as male and females, and fertilization of eggs takes place
      while they float in the ocean,&quot; Ebert said. &quot;The larvae
      then feed for a month or more before turning into tiny sea urchins.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The red sea urchin, in fact,
      does grow fairly quickly when it's young - at the age of two
      years, it can grow from two centimeters to four centimeters in
      one year, doubling its size. But even at that, it still takes
      at least 6-7 years before the sea urchin is of harvestable size,
      the scientists say, compared to the two years that had previously
      been believed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By the time the sea urchin
      is a teenager, its growth slows dramatically. And at the age
      of 22, researchers found it grew each year from about 12 centimeters
      to only 12.1 centimeters. But somewhat remarkably, it appears
      to never really stop growing. It's just very, very slow.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Some of the largest and
      we believe oldest red sea urchins up to 19 centimeters in size
      have been found in waters off British Columbia, between Vancouver
      Island and the mainland,&quot; Ebert said. &quot;By our calculations
      they are probably 200 or more years old.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The first studies indicating
      these ages was done with tagging of individual sea urchins and
      injection with tetracycline, which becomes incorporated into
      the sea urchin skeleton and can be used to track the growth rates.
      The latest work, which was just published, used measures of carbon-14,
      which has increased in all living organisms following the atmospheric
      testing of atomic weapons in the 1950s.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Radiocarbon testing in
      this type of situation provided a very strong and independent
      test of growth rates and ages,&quot; Ebert said. &quot;Among
      other things, it confirmed that in older sea urchins there is
      a very steady, very consistent growth that's quite independent
      of ocean conditions or other variables, and once they near adult
      size our research indicates they do not have growth spurts. With
      this species, it's pretty simple. The bigger they are, the older
      they are.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The research was done with
      red sea urchins, Ebert said, but may be at least partly relevant
      to other sea urchin species.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The study suggests, among other
      things, that this invertebrate species has a fairly poor ability
      to survive various threats during the first year of life and
      reach reproductive age. Otherwise there would be a great many
      more sea urchins.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Older sea urchins can help
      provide more young and therefore may play a key role in creating
      a sustainable fishery, so a return to harvest policies that limits
      harvest above a certain size might be prudent, the researchers
      said. <BR>
