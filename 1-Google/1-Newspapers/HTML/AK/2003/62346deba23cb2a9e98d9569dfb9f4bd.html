      Glaciers, it turns out, aren't so different from people - they
      can gain weight in their bottoms and be less active, scientists
      have discovered.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Glaciers, the heavyweights
      of landscape erosion, grow not just from snow accumulating on
      their surfaces but also from beneath by freezing of meltwater
      which can affect the rate at which they can erode, according
      to a team of scientists, including one from Michigan State University.</FONT></P>

      Their discovery, reported in a cover story in the Aug. 14th issue
      of the international science journal Nature, paints a new picture
      of how glaciers sculpture and erode the earth's landscapes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Glaciers have a profound
      effect on the landscape, especially in mountainous regions, and
      this research allows us to understand how glaciers accomplish
      this,&quot; said Grahame Larson, a professor of geological sciences
      at MSU.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Larson was part of a team of
      scientists who made winter treks to Alaskan and Icelandic glaciers
      to understand how glaciers erode and transport sediment, research
      funded by the National Science Foundation and the Cold Regions
      Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The researchers' interest was
      sparked when they observed that fountains of meltwater rushing
      from some glacier margins spawned icy rims. They eventually were
      able to link this phenomenon of nature to the less lyrical but
      instantly identifiable event of creating ice when one pops open
      a can of very cold soda just pulled from an ice chest.</FONT></P>

      Larson explained that rapidly transferring ice-cold water from
      a high pressure environment - be it the inside of a can of soda
      or beneath a hulking glacier - to a lower pressure environment
      causes ice to form.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The soda-can effect gets a
      new name: glaciohydraulic supercooling. In the case of glaciers,
      this frazil ice forms when meltwater at the glacier bed rushes
      up a steeply rising slope. The new ice then clogs drainage ways
      at the glacier bed, dumping sediment, thus reducing the meltwater's
      (and glacier's) ability to erode. This action is called stabilizing
      feedback and results in the formation of a new dirty-ice layer
      along the glacier's underbelly.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;This is new,&quot; Larson
      said. &quot;We're introducing laws of erosion for glaciers, and
      thus making it easier to understanding how glaciers subdue mountains.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Larson's work at MSU helped
      to substantiate the theory of glaciohydraulic supercooling -
      he detected &quot;bomb tritium,&quot; an isotope of hydrogen
      dispersed across the globe in the 1950s and early 1960s during
      nuclear testing, near the bed of some glaciers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Under the old model of glacier
      building, tritium would be expected only near a glacier surface
      where snow slowly transforms to glacier ice. But Larson showed
      that tritium can also occur near the glacier's base as the result
      of recent snowmelt refreezing due to glaciohydraulic supercooling.</FONT></P>

      the paper, &quot;Stabilizing feedbacks in glacier-bed erosion,&quot;

      Bethlehem, Pa.; and Gregory Baker of the University of Buffalo.<BR>
