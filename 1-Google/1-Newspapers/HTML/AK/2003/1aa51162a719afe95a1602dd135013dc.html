      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The summit of the volcano is
      located approximately 115 meters (377 feet) below the sea surface,
      while the overall height is estimated at more than 580 meters
      (1,903 feet). volcano's diameter at its base is four kilometers
      (2.5 statute miles). Its height is one-third to one-half the
      height of volcanoes on nearby islands, such as Kanaga, Tanaga,
      Gareloi, Cerberus, and Little Sitkin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Reynolds said it is unknown
      whether the volcano might erupt anytime soon, or whether it will
      ever rise above the ocean surface to form a new island. But its

      watching it important. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has been

      Observatory, the state is home to some 100 volcanoes and volcanic
      fields that have been active within the last 1.5 million years.
      Over 40 of these have been active in historic time. About 80%
      of all active volcanoes in the United States and 8% of all active
      above-water volcanoes on earth are in Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most of the state's volcanoes
      are located along the 2,500 kilometer-long (1,550 mile-long)
      Aleutian Arc, which extends westward to Kamchatka, Russia. This
      arc forms the northern portion of the Pacific &quot;ring of fire.&quot;
      Other volcanoes that have been active within the last several
      thousand years exist in Southeast Alaska and in the Wrangell
      Mountains. Smaller volcanoes, some active within the last 10,000
      years, exist in Interior Alaska and in Western Alaska.</FONT></P>

      Reynolds said that while scientists have long suspected that
      undersea volcanoes also exist along the Aleutian Island chain,
      they have until recently lacked the funding and technology to
      go looking for them. Funding from the North Pacific Research
      Board to study deep-sea corals provided the opportunity to examine
      the seafloor geology and its links to seafloor habitat. This

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Reynolds and her colleagues
      suspected that this feature was a volcano following a biological
      exploration dive that occurred during summer 2002. NMFS scientists
      Jon Heifetz and Bob Stone used the <I>Delta</I>, a manned submersible,
      to dive on the site during a search for deep-sea coral habitat.
      They noted the existence of a &quot;volcanic pinnacle&quot; made
      of black lava. Later, Reynolds, whose research expertise is in
      submarine volcanism, confirmed that it was a new volcano in the
      Aleutian volcanic arc.</FONT></P>
