      A waterway close to my house is one of five Pearl creeks in Alaska,
      according to the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, by Donald
      Orth. One might think that five watersheds sharing the same name
      would cause confusion, but Alaska is a big place, and there seems
      to be room for a few repeats.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Take Willow Creek for example.
      Alaska has 63 of them. Twenty-eight Alder creeks are scattered
      around the state. Spruce creeks flow in 22 different locations
      in Alaska, Cottonwoods in 19, and Birches in 14. Prospectors
      and others who mistook spruces for Pines misnamed six creeks
      in Alaska. Those who knew their dendrology named four creeks
      for Tamarack, two for Aspen, and one for Poplar.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fish and game were a handy
      reference for those faced with naming an Alaska stream. Note
      the 39 Fish creeks, 25 Caribou creeks, 17 Porcupine creeks, and
      12 Rabbit (but no Hare) creeks. Larger mammals got even more
      attention; 18 creeks have the name Wolf, after an animal known
      to stalk the Beaver (29 creeks). Sheep inspired the name of 33
      creeks, but not nearly as many as Moose, which give their name
      to 55 creeks. Sixty-seven creeks Bear the name of the state's
      largest carnivore.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In Alaska, there exists one
      Good Creek. Six creeks are Happy, but one is a Problem, and another
      is Difficult. Four are Troublesome, four more are Disappointments,
      and one is Hellbent.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">One Alaska creek is Gay, five
      are Straight, and 26 are Crooked. Ten creeks are Hidden, 21 are
      Lost, and one is Fake. Eight creeks are Swift, but only one is
      Slow. Rose creeks are found in four locations throughout Alaska,
      but none are near Stink Creek.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Alaska creeks are Cold (4),
      Chilly (1), Warm (1), Dry (23), and Extra Dry (2). Alaska creek
      names may drive one to a state of Confusion (1), but at least
      drivers have a choice between Automatic (1) and Standard (2)
      creeks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Alaska has five Mosquito creeks,
      but, alas, just one Dragonfly. Both insects are known to hover
      above Slippery, Slope, Slide, Sleem, and Slime creeks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No Alaska creeks wear the name
      Pebble, but two are Stone, four are Gravel, 34 are Rock and 48
      are Boulder. Miners named six First Chance creeks, 18 Last Chance
      creeks, 23 Eldorados, and 30 Bonanzas. Gold Creek was the natural,
      if hopeful, choice of 25 creek-namers. Four realists named creeks
      for their Hard Luck. Fortune must have smiled at both Too Much
      Gold creeks and at Easy Money Creek, which is not to be confused
      with Easy Moose Creek.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Flowing within Alaska are Thanksgiving
      Creek, Merry Christmas Creek, Happy New Year Creek, four Easter
      creeks, and 13 different Fourth of July creeks. Nineteen creeks
      are Deep, but none are Shallow.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, when considering Alaska's
      creeks, there is but one Question. Of course, there is also an
      Answer.</FONT></P>
