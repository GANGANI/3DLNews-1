      </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On July 9, 1953, at 6 a.m.,
      flying out of Anchorage International Airport, a Northwest Airlines
      pilot noticed a rapidly growing ash cloud erupting from Mount
      Spurr volcano on the northwest side of Cook Inlet, about 80 miles
      west of Anchorage. U.S. Air Force pilot Lt. Metzner also saw
      the ash cloud, witnessing increasingly intense, boiling eruptions
      of dark ash, flashes of lightning in the rising black cloud,
      and ash beginning to fall around the base of the volcano. Violent
      explosions continued through the morning and intermittently into
      late afternoon and evening.</FONT></P>

      Across Cook Inlet, ash began to fall at the Anchorage Airport
      by 10 a.m., and an eerie, premature twilight descended upon the
      city. By 1 p.m., the city was engulfed in darkness, and residents,
      many of whom would not know the source or nature of the phenomenon
      for some time, confronted choking sand and silt-sized ash particles
      that fell intensely for 3 hours and intermittently through the
      night. By the next day, between a quarter and an eighth-inch
      of gritty, gray volcanic debris covered everything. With a dusty
      irritating pall hanging over the city, clean up began.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It took more than 170,000 gallons
      of water to hose off the Merrill airfield, and the city's street
      sweepers worked non-stop for 3 days. Winds repeatedly allowed
      the re-suspension of ash, prolonging residents' discomfort as
      they struggled to clear local roads, buildings and the airport.
      Local commerce was at a standstill, but in the words of the Anchorage
      Daily News, residents of the young frontier city exhibited a
      &quot;calm and resigned attitude.&quot; Relief finally came 3
      weeks later when nearly an inch of rain fell, washing the city
      and stabilizing the ash.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">July 9th marks the 50th anniversary
      of this sudden and dramatic eruption of Crater Peak, the active
      vent on Mount Spurr volcano. At the time of this eruption, scientists
      were unaware that an eruption was imminent, nor did they fully
      comprehend the hazards associated with such an eruption. Now,
      fifty years later, volcano monitoring has improved substantially,
      helping save lives, health and property. By the summer of 1992,
      when three closely spaced eruptions similar in scale to the single
      1953 eruption occurred at Crater Peak, scientists at the Alaska
      Volcano Observatory (AVO) were able to warn communities and the
      aviation industry before the eruption. The AVO is a collaborative
      scientific program formed in 1988 among the U.S. Geological Survey,
      the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, and the Alaska
      Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. Residents were
      more prepared as the 1992 August ash cloud drifted southeastward,
      blanketing Anchorage, Prince William Sound, and the southeastern
      shoreline of the Gulf of Alaska with ash, plunging the city once
      again into premature darkness.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Now, in 2003, seismometers buried in the ground at 25 Alaskan
      volcanoes relay real-time information about volcanic activity
      back to AVO offices in Anchorage and Fairbanks where the data
      are analyzed and interpreted. AVO scientists also evaluate satellite
      images of volcanoes and ash clouds and work closely with the
      National Weather Service to detect and track volcanic ash plumes
      in the North Pacific region. In addition to volcano monitoring,
      AVO scientists prepare volcano hazard assessments of active volcanoes.
      Efforts to understand the frequency of ash fall on populated
      areas are under way.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Today,&quot; said Tom
      Murray, USGS Scientist-in-Charge of AVO, &quot;in the event of
      an eruption at Mount Spurr or any other Alaskan volcano, scientists
      at the Alaska Volcano Observatory are prepared to respond immediately
      by issuing eruption notifications and reports of seismic unrest
      and potential hazards to aviators and emergency management officials.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Scientific understanding of
      volcanic hazards, processes and eruptions has also greatly improved
      in the last 50 years. USGS work in the Cook Inlet region has
      identified at least 15 deposits of volcanic ash originating from
      Mount Spurr volcano over the last 2000 years. Based on this work,
      said Murray, a future eruption as large as or larger than the
      eruptions in 1953 and 1992 is certain.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Volcanic hazards from eruptions
      of Crater Peak are principally airborne ash, pyroclastic flows
      generated by the collapse of the eruption column near the volcano,
      and volcanic debris flows, or lahars, which are generated by
      significant melting of glaciers causing sometimes massive flows
      of water-saturated rock debris. Lahars, in fact, have dammed
      the Chakachatna River, downstream from the volcano, multiple
      times during the last 10,000 years. Breaching of these dams poses
      a significant flood hazard to areas along the Chakachatna River.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The greatest hazard posed by
      eruptions is airborne ash and associated ashfall, said Murray.
      Individual ash particles are hard and do not dissolve in water.
      Volcanic ash consists of tiny jagged particles of rocks, minerals
      and natural glass; it is abrasive, mildly corrosive, and conducts
      electricity when wet.</FONT></P>

      And because of the size and frequency of their eruptions, Alaskan
      volcanoes pose a significant threat to aviation because ash clouds
      often intersect the flight paths of trans-continental aircraft
      flying North Pacific air routes. The air routes, directly over
      and downwind of the volcano-laden Aleutian arc, is one of the
      world's busiest air traffic corridors, carrying 10,000 to 20,000
      people and millions of dollars in cargo every day. Anchorage
      is one of the busiest air cargo airports in the world.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The risk to aviation was dramatically
      demonstrated in December 1989, when an ash cloud from an eruption
      of Redoubt Volcano, 109 miles from Anchorage, disabled all four
      engines of a Boeing 747 during its descent into Anchorage. After
      dropping 2 miles in altitude, the crew was able to restart the
      engines and land safely, though the airplane was seriously damaged.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is just one example of
      the numerous reported aircraft-ash encounters in the North Pacific
      since 1980. Airborne ash can diminish visibility, damage flight
      control systems and may cause engine failure. Even minor amounts
      of ash can cause aircraft damage, create health problems, close
      roads and airports, disrupt utilities, and temporarily contaminate
      water supplies for hundreds of miles downwind of the volcano.
      Adding to the threat for aircraft is that volcanic ash clouds
      are difficult to distinguish from ordinary clouds, both visually
      and on radar, and ash clouds can drift thousands of miles from
      their source.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In addition to the ash threat
      for aircraft, volcanic ash poses other hazards, including:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Health hazards to humans and
        animals, including eye, throat and lung damage.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When volcanic ash accumulates
        on buildings, its weight can cause roofs to collapse.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Because wet ash conducts electricity,
        it can cause short circuits and failures of electronic components,
        which can cause power outages, prevent radio and telephone communication.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ash can also clog air filters
        and otherwise damage vehicles and machinery.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Wet ash may be slippery and
        suspended ash may reduce visibility to near zero, making roads,
        highways, and airport runways treacherous or impassable during
        and for some time after an eruption.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Surface water supplies can
        be temporarily contaminated by the insoluble ash particles and
        associated sulfur compounds, which causes the water to become
        acidic. Streams and lakes clogged with ash may have detrimental
        effects on aquatic organisms, including fish.</FONT>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In response to these potential
      hazards, federal and state agencies worked together to develop
      a system of eruption warning and detection, as well as ash cloud
      tracking and forecasting. This system, noted Murray, not only
      requires scientific expertise, but it also requires effective
      working relationships among volcano observatories, meteorological
      and civil aviation authorities and emergency managers. Participants
      in the system include the USGS, Alaska Volcano Observatory, the
      Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Service,
      the Alaska Division of Emergency Services, the U.S. Air Force,
      and soon, the U.S. Coast Guard.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mount Spurr volcano is on the
      northwest side of Cook Inlet, 80 miles west of Anchorage in the
      eastern Aleutian volcanic arc of Alaska. It is the one of four
      active volcanoes in the Cook Inlet region, Alaska's most populated
      region. Alaska has more than 40 active volcanoes and there have
      been more than 250 eruptions since historical records were kept
      starting in 1760. The Cook Inlet volcanoes (Spurr, Redoubt, Augustine,
      and Iliama) alone have erupted 12 times since 1900.</FONT></P>
