      <P>January 18, 2017<BR>
      Wednesday PM </P>
      <P><BR>
  Ketchikan, Alaska -  It was a year, in which no major story dominated the news in Ketchikan, but as usual there were several smaller, offbeat, bits of news that reminded us what a unique place Ketchikan is.</P>
      <p>First, of all local wildlife made the national news twice in May. First, a marten dragging a chicken across North Tongass Highway caused a two-car accident on the road.</p>
      <p>Then, the same weekend, humpback whales bubble feeding a few feet from the docks at Knudsen Cove were featured on national television shows and websites.</p>
      <p>Later in the year, Ketchikan also made regional and national news when a Prince of Wales resident making his &ldquo;last rounds&rdquo; was reported to the police. It turned out that the gentleman&rsquo;s wife had been driving his remains around Ketchikan in a traveling &ldquo;wake&rdquo; to several places he had frequented during his lifetime. Police suggested that the woman cut the tour short and take the remains to the mortuary.</p>
      <p>In early January, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled against Ketchikan&rsquo;s efforts to change how education is funded in Alaska. The Ketchikan Borough had filed suit against the mandatory local contribution and won a decision in superior court, but the Alaska Supreme Court reversed that ruling and held for the state. Two of the four justices noted that the Borough might have prevailed with a different approach.</p>
      <p>The high water mark of the Ketchikan High School boy's basketball season was January 8, 2016. The first statewide basketball poll showed Ketchikan second, behind Dimond in the state rankings and Ketchikan defeated visiting West Anchorage, the defending state champions, 81-57. Later in the season, the Ketchikan girl's team was ranked first until it was defeated by second ranked Dimond. The girls won the southeast region title for the third straight year, while the boys finished third but both teams advanced to state because of their statewide rankings. The girl's team finished third statewide while the boy's team finished fifth.</p>

      <p>Former Ketchikan resident Forrest Goodluck was featured in the Oscar winning movie, &ldquo;The Revenant.&rdquo; Goodluck, who is of Tsimpshian heritage, played Hawk, the son of Hugh Glass who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Goodluck lived in the area when he was a young child. Goodluck won the 2016 Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film (Supporting Young Actor, Ages 14-21).</p>
      <p>Tobias Elijah Burnette was Ketchikan&rsquo;s first baby of 2016, arriving on the afternoon of Jan. 1. His parents are Leanna Booth and Jack Burnette.</p>
      <p>After several months of grumbling by local residents, Facebook, finally changed its system so that posts from Ketchikan were no longer tagged as Ketchikan, WA. Now there is no state attached to Ketchikan postings, leading some to wonder if Nowhere, 99901 is now truly stateless, at least as far as the internet is concerned.</p>
      <p>Local businessman Randy Johnson, the president of Tyler Rental and the former owner Alaska Ship and Drydock, purchased a 10 percent stake in Ucore Rare Metals for $5 million. Ucore is hoping to develop a rare earth minerals mine at  Bokan Mountain on south Prince of Wales Island.</p>
      <p>Ketchikan enjoyed yet another January &ldquo;hurricane&rdquo; as a storm blew through the area on Jan. 26, packing winds greater than 80 mph.      </p>
      <p>Former Borough Mayor Mike Salazar was named the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year. The 2015 business of the year was Timber and Marine Supply, the entrepreneurs of the year were Debi Hanas and Shirley Solaas of Sweet Mermaids, Kelly Johnson of the Ketchikan Public Library was the youth leader of the year and the Linda and Johnny Gilson won the outstanding community service award for their work with the First City Council on Cancer. Ketchikan also received its official recognition as a Coast Guard city, joining Kodiak and Sitka as the only Coast Guard cities in Alaska.</p>
      <p>The Ketchikan High School drama debate and forensics team won a state championship for the first time in 20 years, and Cheyenne Mathews and Audrey Kistler were the state champions in the signature event, the public forum debate.  Mathews also finished first in the expository speaking competition. Mathews would later go on to finish 3rd in the national American Legion Speech contest.</p>
      <p>Ketchikan&rsquo;s Wearable Arts Show celebrated its 30th anniversary in February. In 2016, KRBD FM celebrated its 40th anniversary and so did the Totem Heritage Center.</p>
      <p>Citing paperwork deficiencies, the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault put Women in Safe Homes on probation for the year and termporarily suspended payment for the $840,000 in funding the organization gets each year. The probation remained in force for several months but funding was restored within a couple of weeks. The probation was lifted by the end of the year and former borough assembly member Agnes Moran became the new executive director of WISH in December.</p>
      <p>Tiernan Johannsen, a fifth grader at Houghtaling Elementary School, was the 2016 Ketchikan Spelling Bee champion. The winning word, m-a-g-n-o-l-i-a.</p>
      <p>In February, the MV Susitna finally left Ketchikan, nearly six years after it was completed at the Ketchikan Ship and Drydock (Now Vigor Alaska). The Sustina was towed to Seattle where it was determined whether or not its engines would be repaired from water damage or scrapped. It was later purchased by the Philippines Red Cross and barged across the Pacific to the Philippines.</p>

      <p align="center">The M/V Susitna, originally constructed for Alaska's Matanuska-Susitna Borough using public funds, arrived at Subic Bay Freeport, Philippines in December 02, 2016. The Phillippine Red Cross paid $1.75 million for the M/V Susitna far from its original public tax funded price of $80 million. The vessel was purchased as an ambulance ship. by the Phillippine Red Cross. The vessel was never used by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough for its intended purpose.<br>

The FBI later determined that local law enforcement was acting appropriate in its investigations of the missing people.</p>

      <p>Governor Bill Walker met with local officials and promised to spend the more than $90 million left in the state coffers from the Gravina Access Project on Ketchikan transportation projects. State officials had previously committed to only spending $23 million of the money in Ketchikan. More than $300 million in federal money was originally earmarked for the project, most of that money went elsewhere in the state.</p>
