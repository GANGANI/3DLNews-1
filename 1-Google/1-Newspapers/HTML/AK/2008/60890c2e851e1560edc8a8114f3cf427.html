      A giant meteor may have exploded over Alaska thousands of years
      ago, shooting out metal fragments like buckshot, some of which
      embedded in the tusks of woolly mammoths and the horns of bison.
      Simultaneously, a large chunk of the meteor hit Alaska south
      of Allakaket, sending up a dust cloud that blacked out the sun
      over the entire state and surrounding areas, killing most of
      the life in the area. </FONT><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Such is the scenario envisioned
      by Rick Firestone, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley
      National Laboratory in California. Firestone and his colleagues
      have found mammoth tusks and a bison skull with nickel-rich iron
      particles in them on one side, suggesting the metal fragments
      all came from the same direction.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Firestone's theory emerged
      when his colleague, Alan West of Dewey, Arizona, saw at a Phoenix
      gem and mineral show a mammoth tusk peppered with tiny bits of
      metal. Intrigued, West and Firestone looked at tusks owned by
      the same dealer in Calgary. By passing a magnet over mammoth
      tusks in Calgary, Firestone and West found seven mammoth tusks
      collected somewhere near the Yukon River and a bison skull from
      Siberia that had tiny iron fragments burned into them. The fragments
      also contained nickel.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;One in 1,000 tusks had
      this material in it,&quot; Firestone said.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Firestone also thinks he may
      have found the divot left by the ancient meteorite, an impact
      crater that is now occupied by a round body of water named Sithylemenkat
      Lake in the upper Kanuti River drainage.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The creeks coming out
      of the lake are very rich in nickel,&quot; Firestone said, referring
      to a metal associated with meteorites. &quot;And the shape is
      consistent with a crater from a meteorite that may have been
      a half a kilometer in diameter-a pretty large thing.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A meteorite that big would
      have torched anything within a 100-mile radius and could have
      buried the mammoths farther away from the crater, preserving
      the tusks struck by metal fragments. Firestone said the dust
      kicked up by the meteor would have eliminated any mammoths that
      survived the meteor's hit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;There was probably 10,000
      years with no mammoths,&quot; he said, adding that other mammoths
      eventually migrated back into Alaska.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Dale Guthrie, one of Alaska's
      few experts on mammoths, said he found Firestone's theory interesting,
      but Alaska scientists who know about impact craters think he
      is probably off on his guess that Sithylemenkat Lake is the place
      where a giant meteorite struck about 35,000 years ago (the approximate
      age of the mammoth tusks). Scientists have confirmed only one
      impact crater in Alaska-called Avak, near Barrow-and have discovered
      only about 140 impact craters on the entire planet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Buck Sharpton, an expert on
      impact craters and the Vice Chancellor for Research at the University
      of Alaska Fairbanks, said the lake would have to be much older
      than 35,000 years because it has no rim associated with more
      recent impact craters and doesn't look to him like an impact
      crater. He thinks the iron bits in the tusks could be cavities
      filled by &quot;being immersed for millennia in porous sedimentary
      fill through which iron-rich water percolated.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As for Sithylemenkat Lake,
      Gordon Herreid didn't mention a possible meteorite impact when
      he wrote a 1969 geology report on the lake for the state (which
      ordered the investigation because of possible nickel deposits
      there). Jan Cannon wrote in the journal Science in 1977 that
      the lake looked to be the only visible impact crater in Alaska
      based on a study of Landsat satellite images. One year later,
      William Patton of the U.S. Geological Survey argued in Science
      that glaciers, rather than a meteorite, created the lake.</FONT></P>
