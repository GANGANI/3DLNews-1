      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">September 25, 2008<BR>
      Thursday</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      It was interesting to see Ketchikan's  Mayor Weinstein, whom
      I voted for, on CNN ragging on the so called &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;.from
      the bully pulpit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I was wondering when I was
      watching, if the Mayor and left wing hack reporter were actually
      on the Walden Point Road to Nowhere or the Gravina Road?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Seems that the National Media
      is clueless about the Walden Point Road to Nowhere that was visible
      from the helicopter that whisked the Mayor and the correspondent
      of the Clinton News Network, bent on bashing Palin and supporting
      Obama around the area. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I heard that the pilot overheard
      the reporter asking - well, what is that ugly scar over there,
      but was quickly distracted to the Gravina Road. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hey, National Media,  if you
      are listening - you are on the take from the Obama win at all
      costs campaign, to bash and trash our community and governor
      . But, alas you will ask nothing about the Walden Point Road
      to Nowhere that was visible from your helicopter, where the multi
      tens of millions of tax dollars have been blown to make a stupid
      Boondoggle Road out of a small town to move the ferry out of
      downtown Metlakatla, that now services the people of Metlakatla
      just fine. Now, the citizens of Metlakatla will have to drive
      20 miles to Walden Point to catch the ferry to Ketchikan. The
      terminal that is in downtown Metlakatla works just fine the way
      it is. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The road is not even close
      to being finished after 6 years of torment and 10's of millions
      of tax dollars poured into it with no end of pork in sight!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">This hideous road hacked into
      a beautiful mountainside,  is clearly visible from Google Earth
      and the EPA had no say in the lands destruction. My question
      to the National Media is, why no coverage of this Boondoggle
      Road to Nowhere? And all the focus is on the Gravina Road? </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well, I will tell you why,
      it is to try to bash Sarah Palin so Obama will get elected plain
      and simple. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The left wing political hacks
      at ABC, NBC, CBS, CBC, CNN, NPR, MSNBC, AND A THOUSAND OTHER
      HACK SITES. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">They are hurling the rudest,
      lowest slime at Sarah Palin &amp; family, which has never been
      seen in politics ever!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A Florida nut case, disgraced
      democrat hack Judge that was removed for corruption. Alcee Hastings,
       said Wednesday that VP candidate Sarah Palin needs people to
      be wary of her because, &quot;anybody toting guns and stripping
      moose, don't care too much about what they do with Jews and African
      Americans&quot;.     </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now what the hell??  If any
      Republican said that about Barak, this would be on National News
      for a week! </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But that is the Liberal news
      you never hear of. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then, there's the nutty CBC
      columnist Heather Mallick, who said Todd Palin was a f%$#@$g
      hillbilly and Sarah was a hooker and all Alaskans are drunken,
      crazy people and Palin is White trash and other slanderous juvenile
      nonsense. Think if an American columnist like Bill O'Reilly called
      Barak Obama,  Black trash??</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We have never seen such vile
      attacks in our political history!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now, they are trying anything
      to blame the Ponzi Scheme Mortgage meltdown on Bush, McCain and
      other Republicans, when if you really follow what happened, it
      is the Democrats Like Barney Frank that repeatedly blocked all
      oversight of the whole mess and former Fannie Mae Execs. are
      Obama's &quot;Top Economic Advisors&quot; and should be thrown
      in the clink!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Why should I bail out any of
      these crooks? I say let it run its course and those who lose
      so what!!  But what it is, is that all the whining folks who
      will lose their 401k savings and houses and such, somehow think
      its up to me to save them. <BR>
       <BR>
      I have no retirement or healthcare, and if you put your money
      in those crooked companies, oh well - tough luck!!  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">No one would shed a tear if
      I lost all I had, they would just say, hey Tom Ferry made some
      bad investments in Ketchikan Real Estate and now he's out on
      the streets, too bad, I still have my cozy taxpayer guaranteed
      retirement complete with Colas and endless perks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Well that's how I feel about
      this meltdown. The Democrats, Barney Frank and Chris Dodd are
      two boneheads that never let John McCain have any oversight.
       Ask any local banker what happened. They were forced by the
      Fed's to lower their standards on lending, so all the poor folks
      could get a home, even if their credit sucked and they could
      not really afford a home. All that didn't matter to the libs...
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Now I might be on the hook
      for more than a trillion dollars. No one really knows how much
      it might cost, maybe two trillion. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">That means, no Hillary care
      now, forget it won't happen. They might even have to take away
      Indian care. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I think McCain is a lot smarter
      than we give him credit for. He is going to now go in and find
      out who the culprits are and as we Conservatives know,  most
      of them are thick with Obama. No wonder Obama wants to debate
      instead of investigate. The truth will come out in a week or
      so that he is thick as thieves in with the perps that bankrupted
      America. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We need to grab pitchforks
      and torches and burn the barons out of their mansions, like Obama's
      Chief Economic Advisor, Harold Rains who made 90 million dollars
      as Fannie Mae's, CEO in six years. He's big buddies with Charlie
      Rangel ,who has millions stashed in illegal offshore tax havens,
      another crook - Pathetic!<BR>
       <BR>
      We need a good depression to clear out all the old geezer politicians
      and banker fraudsters and let honest people take over. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Grab all the scumbags mansions
      and kick the crooks out on the streets and really take back this
      country. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Lord,  this doesn't even include
      the 7 billion, we Alaskan taxpayers are on the hook for to bail
      out the public workers of Alaska Unions. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I say, to hell with all of
      you!!  Get your hand out of my wallet! I can't afford to supplement
      all these socialist lifestyles anymore. <BR>
                                                                  
          <BR>
      I challenge anyone to prove I am wrong!<BR>
