      Al Gore today said his irresponsible lies blaming global warming
      for every catastrophe to occur on Earth in the past few years
      were themselves a consequence of global warming, and warned that
      if we don't want more people like him mouthing off, we had better
      cut back soon on carbon emissions.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The warming has fried
      my brain,&quot; Gore said, adding that he had totally lost control
      of his tongue, which wags mendaciously at every opportunity.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Why, not so long ago,
      I was arguing in my Oscar-winning movie that we would have oceans
      rising 20 feet within the very near future, only I failed to
      explain what I meant by 'very near future.' I meant within a
      couple of thousand years. I should have modified the phrase better.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;That,&quot; he said,
      with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders, &quot;is more or less
      typical of what's been happening, although I didn't exactly blame
      Hurricane Katrina on global warming. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I noted there had always
      been and always would be hurricanes and that their frequency
      depends on lots of things, but then, you know, I added how warm
      oceans make hurricanes stronger and what not, and if you didn't
      get the impression I meant global warming was behind Katrina,
      I missed my bet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I made a similar point
      but was still a little less careful when I was interviewed on
      public radio the other day,&quot; he said. He shook his head,
      and glanced downward, the smile now gone from his face.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I was talking about the
      cyclone in Myanmar, and then I tied it in with a storm that hit
      Bangladesh last fall and a cyclone that ravaged China the year
      before that, and then I said, 'We're seeing consequences that
      scientists have long predicted might be associated with continued
      global warming'.&quot; </FONT></P>

      &quot;Now, of course, I left myself a way out. I did use the
      word 'might.' But if you look carefully at that sentence, the
      impact on an audience is, &quot;Watch out, run for it, global
      warming is causing calamities, just as science said it would.'
      The more responsible thing would have been to make it clear we
      cannot possibly say as much. I left myself wide open for the
      critics who have pointed out how certain scientists said last
      year that the hurricane season would be about as fierce as fierce
      gets, and then had to find excuses when the season was more mild
      than wild.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;But listen,&quot; he
      said, his eyes narrowing and a look of sincere smugness crossing
      his face, &quot;none of this means I am wrong on the big issue,
      which is that greenhouse gases are causing everything to become
      unbelievably hot. Our only hope is to cut back on energy usage
      per capita to a level about like we had a couple of centuries
      ago. If we don't do this, at some tiny sacrifice in the way of
      giving up most of what we call modernity and some millions starving
      here and there, you will have more people like me. You will have
      people whose brains have been cooked and whose capacity for a
      realistic, honest sense of balance has been utterly destroyed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;You will have people
      refusing to admit that what's actually happening doesn't fit
      their assumptions and engaging in ad hominem attacks on any scientist
      with differing explanations from their own. You will have people
      predicting sweeping illnesses, famine and more and calling for
      solutions that will give us sweeping illnesses, famine and more,
      much as ethanol is now causing hunger in the world. So get with
      it, do you hear me? Good heavens, get with it!&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Here my report ends, and with
      it a confession for anyone who didn't catch on: I made up the
      Gore confession. His global alarmism made me do it.</FONT></P>
