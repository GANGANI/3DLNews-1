      Most chemists can't display samples of a compound that is named
      after them.  So, in a way, I was a very fortunate wannabe chemist
      when I raided my piggy bank for a gleaming clump of pyrite -
      also known as fool's gold.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pyrite is a common mineral
      that is a compound of reduced, or electron-rich, forms of iron
      and sulfur.  About the only thing that it has in common with
      gold is its color, and even that requires some gullibility. 
      As far as minerals go, gold is soft and malleable.  Its beautiful
      luster is extremely uniform and resistant to corrosion.  Pyrite
      is almost as hard as quartz (the principal component of common
      glass) and it naturally forms a multi-faceted structure, often
      with indelible striations in color.  It is easily oxidized to
      rusty goo and sulfur dioxide gas, which you get a whiff of every
      time to strike a match. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Another crystalline treasure
      that I collected in my youth - <A HREF="http://www.3dchem.com/molecules.asp?ID=184">amethyst
      </A>- has a superficial look-alike as well, but there is some
      dispute over which one belongs to the fool.  Also known as purple
      quartz, amethyst is often found in the same six-sided peak-capped
      prisms as the large quartz crystals used by psychics to facilitate
      their clairvoyance.  (In this case, the identity of the fool
      is not in dispute.)  </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The similarities between amethyst
      and quartz, however, go beneath the surface hardness and the
      shape of the crystals.  Both have the chemical composition of
      silica (one-part silicon and two-parts oxygen) but in amethyst,
      for every million silicon atoms, approximately 40 are replaced
      by iron atoms, and this makes the color purple.  Ironically,
      the uniformity and depth of color, which increase the value of
      the gemstone, depend on the distribution of impurities.</FONT></P>

      <P><A HREF="http://www.galleries.com/minerals/halides/fluorite/fluorite.htm"><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fluorite</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1"
       FACE="Verdana"> can have the same beautiful purple color as
      amethyst, but the similarities end there.  The color is due to
      impurities, yes, but they are europium atoms sparsely distributed
      among a lattice that has a 2:1 makeup of fluorine to calcium
      atoms.  Fluorite is not as hard as amethyst, and it naturally
      forms cubic shapes.  I wouldn't call fluorite &quot;fool's amethyst&quot;
      because both are beautiful minerals and are worthy of the thoughtful
      collector's attention. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The name amethyst comes form
      the Greek word for &quot;not intoxicated&quot; and is tied to
      classical mythology involving the Greek god of wine.  Dionysus
      poured his intoxicating beverage over a virgin, named Amethyst,
      after she had prayed to be turned into colorless stone to prevent
      ravaging by beasts in his forest.  She remained stone-cold sober,
      but was now purple and made of stone.  Or something like that.
       The details of who did what to whom and why are a little sketchy
      on Wikipedia, just as they often are the morning after a party
      hosted by college students on Greek row.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">And this is precisely the reason
      that a growing chorus of college presidents have borrowed Amethyst's
      name to identify their petition to reconsider the drinking age
      in the United States.  Amethyst also inspired the traditional
      but foolish belief that wine goblets made of the mineral named
      after her would prevent intoxication.  </FONT></P>

      <P><A HREF="http://www.amethystinitiative.org/statement"><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Amethyst Initiative</FONT></A><FONT
       SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"> asks state and federal representatives
      to engage in a public debate about the far-reaching effects of
      allowing adults between the ages of 18 and 21 to vote and serve
      in the military, but not to consume alcoholic beverages.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Groups such as Mothers Against
      Drunk Driving have reacted forcefully against this initiative.
       Critics of this initiative often use the word &quot;foolish&quot;.
       As a result, some college presidents, particularly in areas
      where temperance laws still exist, have withdrawn their names
      from the petition.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">While raising the drinking
      age has probably resulted in fewer alcohol-related traffic fatalities
      among young adults, so has sharply raising the price of gas.
       My point is that there are many factors at play, and changing
      one can have unintended consequences on many. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Unintended consequences, far
      greater than any frenzied madness unleashed by Dionysus, were
      what led Congress to overwhelmingly approve the 21st amendment
      to the United States Constitution, repealing the Eighteenth and
      ending the so-called Prohibition era.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Interestingly, and to be filed
      under &quot;some things never change&quot;, politicians of the
      day anticipated that grassroots efforts would make it difficult
      to ratify the repeal of Prohibition by the usual, and sober,
      process of votes in state legislatures.  Instead, they opted
      for state conventions.  Political conventions aren't quite frat
      parties, but they aren't church picnics either.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On the surface, the military-at-18-but-alcohol-at-21
      rule strikes me as fundamentally un-American, and not altogether
      different from the &quot;three-fifths compromise&quot; between
      North and South that was originally written into the Constitution.
       </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Also to be filed under some
      things never change, if we don't consider all the factors, and
      think things all the way through, we're sure to be fooled again.
