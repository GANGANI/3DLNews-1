      Erin Burnett of CNBC is not just another frequently appearing
      pretty TV face in the world of big-time business reporting. The
      anchor of CNBC's &quot;Street Signs&quot; (2-3 p.m.) and co-anchor
      of &quot;Squawk on the Street&quot; (9-11 a.m.), Burnett is a
      former investment banking analyst at Goldman Sachs and a former
      vice president at Citigroup. She's also a member of the Council
      on Foreign Relations and a regular contributor to NBC network
      news shows and &quot;Morning Joe&quot; on MSNBC.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I talked to Burnett by telephone
      at 3 p.m. Thursday as stocks were soaring on word that the federal
      government was going to create a special entity that would handle
      the huge real estate debt that has brought down major financial
      institutions and created a crisis on Wall Street:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Q: On a 1-to-10 scale, 10 being a meltdown, where are we right
      now?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: It depends on who you ask.
      For many market players, this is a 9 or 10 event. You continue
      to see headlines discussing this as the worst crisis since the
      Great Depression. Some people would even say it's the worst crisis
      since 1907, so if you think about it that way, you have to say
      it's a 10.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you look across America,
      which is something I've been spending a lot of time doing with
      CEOs of regional banks who can speak for one bank or up to 1,000
      banks, there is a slow economy. That is a broader fundamental
      issue. But in terms of whether these banks are operating, able
      to get money, able to lend money, able to consider bringing in
      new customers and funding new projects, their answer is, &quot;Yes,
      they're able to do all those things.&quot; So on that Main Street
      level, things have gotten worse, there are some real concerns,
      but it is most certainly not a 10. I don't know what it is, but
      let's call it a 5 or a 6.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: What is your sound-bite
      answer to a typical stockholder or nervous 401(k) owner who asks,
      &quot;What the heck's going on?&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: Over the past few years,
      money is like water. There was a lot of money and that money
      helped big institutions lend money to all sorts of people, including
      regular Americans. That's why mortgage rates were absurdly low
      and people could buy bigger homes than they ever thought they
      could buy for no money down. It's all part of the same story.
      Money was easy to come by and so it was very easy to borrow.
      What happens for an individual homeowner or an overall economy
      is that at one point people start to look and say, &quot;Wow!
      Should I really be lending money to this person? Does this really
      make sense?&quot; And money becomes a little bit more expensive.
      Interest rates go up a little bit. That's where we are seeing
      the strain now. It's lax spending and you've got to pay the piper
      some day. You go to a party and you binge. You eat the corn dogs
      and pigs in a blanket. You drink the cider, you drink the wine,
      you have the vodka. But you wake up the next morning and you
      feel pretty awful. That's where we are right now.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: To paraphrase John McCain,
      are our economic fundamentals sound?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: Nora O'Donnell asked me
      that the other day on MSNBC right after McCain made that comment
      about the fundamentals being sound. It's a refrain that Treasury
      Secretary Henry Paulson has used, the president has used, but
      a lot of people roll their eyes at. They're wrong in the sense
      that incomes by any fair measure have not grown for average people
      over the past eight years; certainly they have not outpaced inflation.
      Home prices over the past couple years have fallen sharply --
      15 percent over the past year. And we have been losing jobs in
      this country for the last five months. So in that sense you could
      say that the fundamentals are not strong. But, if you compare
      job loss now in this particular slowdown to job loss in a normal,
      &quot;standard&quot; recession, we're not losing that many jobs.
      We'd be losing a whole lot more in a standard recession. So things
      could be worse. But in terms of the fundamentals, I would say
      they are strong.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">America gets most of its jobs
      from small businesses. Those small businesses are small companies,
      family-owned companies across the country that create most of
      the jobs and they really create the entrepreneurial spirit that
      makes this country the place a lot of people want to move to
      because they think they can fulfill their aspirations and their
      ambition.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In that respect, the fundamentals
      are strong. That's what makes America the envy of people around
      the world. I have spent a lot of time over the past year traveling
      to the Middle East and India and Africa. Even in Libya, where
      I was last weekend and where there is an ingrained dislike of
      the United States on one level, there is such amazing admiration
      for our financial system. That's pretty invigorating. On that
      level the fundamentals are strong. That may not be specifically
      what John McCain was referring to, but I can tell you that he
      is both right and he is wrong.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Q: Is another big shoe going to drop on us?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: I wish I knew the answer
      to that one. Last fall everyone thought that the next shoe to
      drop was a billion-dollar write-down from a bank. Those were
      the big things that were causing such huge concern and fear.
      Then when Bear Stearns happened, everyone thought that was the
      final shoe. And then this summer happened and you had Fannie
      and Freddie and then a week later you had Lehman Brothers and
      Merrill Lynch. And now you have aggressive stock price drops
      for the two remaining independent investment banks (Morgan Stanley
      and Goldman Sachs). Nobody knows what the next shoe is and I
      think that's the fear. It could be a commercial bank. It could
      be one of those investment banks. It might not be anything. But
      it is that fundamental uncertainty that's really causing the
      system to freeze up.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: Where should people put
      their money? Should they keep it under their mattress, put it
      in a CD or what?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: That's a tough one. One
      of the things to emphasize to people is there are significant
      investment protections in place in this country. There are federal
      protections in place for people who save money -- we all know
      about the FDIC. There are also protections in place for investors
      through what is called the Securities Industry Protection Corp.,
      the SIPC. If you have a brokerage account and your broker fails,
      they must give you back everything in your account -- and they
      usually do. If there is a problem with that or fraud, the SIPC
      will step in and people will get their money back usually up
      to half a million dollars. Insurance is regulated (by states)
      across the country, but there are also protections in place for
      that. The thing I would emphasize is that there are protections
      in place.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Generally speaking, you are
      protected. The one thing nobody can protect you against is a
      big drop in market value; there's no protection in the world
      that can help you from that. If you really think the market is
      going to keep crashing, maybe you would take your money out.
      But at this point, if you have gotten this far, you potentially
      run the risk of being one of the people who run out of the market
      and then you just might miss the big bounce, which is what happens
      to retail investors all the time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I'm not recommending anything
      specifically. But if you have a long-term plan, you might want
      to stick with it. I will say this: Talking to hedge fund managers,
      talking to pension fund managers, they all tell me that they
      see a lot of opportunity right now. So there will come out of
      this probably some of the most amazing buying opportunities in
      a long time. Good luck finding them. </FONT></P>

      Q: Do you put the blame for this financial crisis on any one
      thing or organization?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: I don't, and I'm not saying
      that to be coy. I don't believe anyone knows exactly who is to
      blame. I think that is because a lot of people were to blame.
      Fundamentally, greed was to blame. A lot of people at a lot of
      different institutions in a lot of different roles -- at banks,
      at hedge funds, regular investors, home buyers, regular people
      across the country -- were greedy. People thought that they could
      invest their money and it would be guaranteed to go up. The most
      sophisticated investors and regular homeowner people went out
      and took out these loans that frankly if they had been really
      looked at they would have realized they couldn't afford to. Home
      prices have never gone up 50 percent a year, and suddenly people
      started to think that was acceptable. Or even 10 percent a year
      was acceptable. Those things, if we had really looked honestly
      -- any of us -- at ourselves in the mirror, we would have known
      that was impossible. So in a sense, everybody is to blame. That's
      my big-picture answer.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On a more specific level, certainly
      there was some real failure in the regulatory system. That doesn't
      mean we need to regulate more. It just means the regulation wasn't
      appropriate for the financial innovation that was out there.
      The lending was lax. Banks were giving loans to individuals and
      companies that shouldn't have gotten them. And the people taking
      out those loans were not being responsible in many cases. You
      can't really just say, &quot;Oh, it's the regulators' fault.
      If we had regulated it right everything would have been fixed.
      Or if we put all these restrictions in place. If we didn't let
      people short-sell everything would be fine.&quot; All of that
      is too simplistic to blame the entire crisis on.</FONT></P>

      Inc.<BR>
      </FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: Is there a political solution
      to this crisis or is it a matter of letting the economics and
      financial conditions play out?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: The RTC thing in a sense
      would be political. It would involve the government. When you
      have the financial system as a whole truly at risk, it's hard
      to imagine really not having the government involved. A lot of
      people who would be as free market as one could be are holding
      their nose and saying Hank Paulson did what he had to do. There's
      no question we have just seen the greatest increase in government
      involvement in capitalism that we've ever seen, frankly, and
      that many people would have a real ethical problem with -- and
      not just ethical, might believe it would cause markets to operate
      inefficiently over time. But if you're the treasury secretary
      and you realize you are going to end up with potential financial
      Armageddon, you have to do what you have to do. So I think it
      is very hard to be critical of Treasury Secretary Paulson.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I think most people on Wall
      Street would say, &quot;Thank goodness he's there.&quot; He understands
      these companies. He knows how they operate. He knows how they
      make money. He understands the product they offer. That says
      a lot. I think a lot of people are very grateful that he's there.
      They may wish that some of these decisions that he's been forced
      to make don't end staying with us forever -- like nationalizing
      insurance companies or nationalizing home ownership. It's hard
      to judge if you can't come up with a better way of having handled
      the crisis when the crisis actually struck. Maybe if we'd made
      different decisions years ago we could have prevented it. But
      certainly over the past six months it's hard to imagine what
      could have been done specifically to completely avert the crisis
      that didn't involve the government in any way shape or form.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The one thing that I would
      say that our constituents and that I believe is that government
      may need to be involved, but you want them to be involved in
      the smallest possible way they can be involved to help fix the
      problem. That's what you want it to be. Getting that balance
      right is not necessarily easy, I recognize that. You certainly
      don't want the government telling capital where it should be
      allocated. People who have expertise in capital are the best
      people to make that decision.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Q: The Wall Street Journal
      says there's no end in sight for this crisis. How long do think
      it will last?</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A: In terms of the immediate
      crisis right now, this sort of not knowing what is going to happen
      every day -- and whether you are going to have to work 48 hours
      through the weekend at the Treasury Department and have another
      bailout or a crisis -- that, hopefully, will start to calm a
      bit. But the broader issue -- the long-term change in lending
      standards, where it might be harder to borrow, where you might
      have to put more money down, etc., -- is probably going to last
      a long time. I don't know how long, but I can tell you that the
      guidance I get from CEOs in the housing industry and the banking
      industry is that it is likely at least to the end of next year
      and probably well into 2010.<BR>
