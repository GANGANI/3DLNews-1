      Ketchikan, Alaska - Alaska is a land of geological superlatives:
      Big mountains, vast spaces, huge earthquakes.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So it would stand to reason
      that an event that happened exactly 50 years ago on July 9th
      is also the largest of its kind ever recorded.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On July 9, 1958, the largest
      wave in modern history occurred in Lituya Bay, on the northern
      Southeast Alaska coast about halfway between Cape Spencer and
      Yakutat.</FONT></P>

      Initially, the wave - generated by a landslide that itself was
      generated by a massive earthquake that shook the region for more
      than a thousand miles up and down the coast - reached a height
      of more than 1,700 feet. It was still nearly 100 feet high when
      it reached the mouth of the bay seven miles later.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In its path were three small
      trolling boats taking advantage of the fact that Lituya Bay was
      the closest anchorage to the lucrative Fairweather fishing grounds
      offshore.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In fact, Lituya Bay is the
      only secure anchorage along more than 100 miles of Gulf of Alaska
      coast from just north of Cape Spencer to Yakutat. The entrance
      to Lituya Bay is extremely dangerous, and should only be attempted
      is short (10 to 20 minute) periods of slack water, according
      to the United States Coast Pilot book series.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Despite that challenge, the
      bay is often the refuge of choice when the weather gets bad along
      the coast.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Interestingly enough, the weather
      on July 9, 1958 was not the reason that three fishing vessels
      chose to anchor up in Lituya Bay.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">According to one of the surviving
      fishermen, Howard Ulrich, it was a sunny day and the waters around
      the mouth of the bay were calm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Fishing had been poor
      on that memorable ninth day of July and I pulled my gear and
      headed the <I>Edrie </I>for Lituya Bay early in the evening,&quot;
      Ulrich told the Alaska Sportsman Magazine in an article for its
      October, 1958 issue. &quot;all was smooth.it was a quiet and
      peaceful anchorage.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two other boats joined the
      <I>Edrie</I> inside the bay, that night, the <I>Badger </I>and
      the <I>Sunmore.</I> But they chose an anchorage on the other
      side of the bay from the Edrie. When the wave came, two crews
      would survive and one crew would not.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A History of Big Waves</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The unusual geology of Lituya
      Bay has lent itself to several large waves in the last 150 years.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The seven mile long, two mile
      wide bay has two large glaciers and several large mountains rising
      steeply from tidewater. It is only a few miles as the crow flies
      from tidewater to high mountains like Crillion (12,726 feet)
      and Fairweather (15,300 feet) making it a popular staging area
      for climbers. In fact, two groups of Canadian climbers narrowly
      missed being in the bay the night of July 9th. Had they been
      camped at tidewater as planned, the wave's death toll would have
      more than 20 rather than only two.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The weather also plays a role in the bay as it gets a large amount
      of precipitation - mostly rainfall. Some of the inland areas
      along the coast between Lituya Bay and Yakutat have had more
      than 300 inches of rain according to the National Weather Service
      and the winter and spring of 1958 was a wet one throughout Southeast
      Alaska. The ground in Lituya Bay - which frequently gets up to
      150 inches of rain a year - was oversaturated even though it
      was sunny that July.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The third factor was the massive
      earthquakes that frequently topped 6 and 7 on Richter Scale in
      the area.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A final factor was the deep
      water - up to 800 feet - near the head of the bay. When earthquakes
      or other events caused landslides, they would displace large
      amounts of water sending it rushing toward the narrow mouth of
      the bay and the open ocean.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Federal geologist Don Miller
      was the foremost expert on Lituya Bay in the 1950s and the early
      1960s. In his 1960 report, &quot;Giant Waves in Lituya Bay Alaska.&quot;
      he pointed out evidence of five &quot;giant&quot; waves created
      primarily by land or glacier slides between 1853 and 1958.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      The 1853-54 wave was estimated at 395 feet, the 1874 wave at
      80 feet, the 1899 wave at 200 feet, the 1936 wave at 490 feet
      and the 1958 behemoth swept trees off a hillside at more than
      1,720 feet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In addition to those giant
      waves, the waters of Lituya Bay had also been the site of several
      other disasters involving both the native Tlingit tribes and
      groups of American, British and French explorers and adventurers
      from the 1780s into the Twentieth Century, according to Philip
      Fradkin in his 2001 book &quot;Wildest Alaska: Journeys of Great
      Peril in Lituya Bay.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Most of these involved the
      deadly, narrow entrance that featured tide rips and waters running
      up to 13 knots in either direction. Most notable was a disaster
      that cost French explorer Jean-Francois La Perouse more than
      20 of his sailors. Fradkin also noted that Tlingit oral tradition
      featured several stories of &quot;giant&quot; waves and mass
      drownings in the bay.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Three Boats In the Bay</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There were two commonly used
      anchorages near the mouth of Lituya Bay on that July night in
      1958. Ulrich and his eight-year-old son &quot;Sonny&quot; chose
      to anchor about half a mile in from the mouth on the south side
      of the bay in place called, appropriately enough &quot;Anchorage
      Cove.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Two other trolling boats, the
      <I>Sunmore </I>(with Orville and Mickey Wagner on board) and
      the <I>Badger</I> (operated by Bill and Vivian Swanson) anchored
      up on the opposite side of the bay, just behind the nearly mile
      long spit that extended most of the way across the mouth of the
      bay. The opening itself was less than 300 yards across and most
      of that water was too shallow for boats to cross. Some fishermen
      estimate there may less than 50 feet of open water at times.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Ulrichs had anchored up
      just after 8 pm, while the other two boats - running partners
      who both lived in Juneau - anchored up around 9 pm.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Around 8 pm, a plane took off
      from near Cenotaph Island (so named after the drowning of the
      20 French sailors in 1786). On board were 10 Canadians who had
      just returned from the first Canadian ascent of Mount Fairweather.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The expedition was scheduled
      to leave the following day, but the pilot of their Royal Canadian
      Air Force amphibian arrived at 6 pm that night and told them
      to pack immediately,&quot; Fradkin wrote in &quot;Wildest Alaska.&quot;
      &quot;He was worried about the possibility of fog and wanted
      to get the climbers back to Juneau that night. The climbers cursed
      the pilot's nervousness. They missed dinner in a hurry to pack
      and departed at 9 pm. Another party of climbers was due that
      day by boat but they had been delayedHad the two groups proceeded
      as planned, there would have been a total of 20 climbers camped
      on the shoreline that night.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Fradkin noted that the Canadian
      climbers weren't the only living things making a fortuitous getaway
      from the bay.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;As the Canadian climbers
      flew away, so did the nervous kittiwakes (that nested on the
      cliffs of Cenotaph Island),&quot; Fradkin wrote. &quot;The gulls
      ascended like so much confetti blown upward. The high intensity
      alarm call of thousands of birds echoed through the still bay.
      They passed over the Badger and splattered the boat with droppings.
      Some crashed into the vessel's rigging and plummeted to the deck.
      The Swansons were frightened.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Up and down the coast as far
      as Yakutat and Hoonah observers would report similar odd behavior
      by shore birds and other animals. Then, at approximately 10:16
      pm, it happened.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Cursing Myself For
      Not Moving Sooner&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The quake was later determined
      to be 8.3 on the earthquake scale and was centered 45 miles south
      of Lituya in Cross Sound. It was felt strongly as far south as
      Seattle and as far north as Anchorage. At Yakutat, 80 miles to
      the north of Lituya, three people out berry picking died instantly
      when a small island they were on immediately dropped more than
      two dozen feet under the water. Later measurements determined
      that a nearby mountain had risen more than 50 feet at the same
      time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Overall, the earth had moved
      some 21 feet horizontally and 3.5 feet vertically along most
      of the fault line. While most earthquakes last only a few seconds,
      the initial length of the quake was later estimated at more than
      two minutes by Don Miller.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Then Lituya Bay got hit with
      the other shoe.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Miller - who was in Glacier
      Bay at the time of quake and flew to Lituya the next day - determined
      that less than two minutes after the initial tremor, the side
      of an unnamed 5,616 foot peak on the east side of Gilbert Inlet
      (at the head of the bay) plunged into the bay. At least 2,000
      feet of rock fell.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The noise was deafening,&quot;
      Fradkin wrote. &quot;The violent impact of forty million cubic
      yards of rock, ice and coarse soil weighing ninety million tonswas
      heard 50 miles to the north. Ulrich said it sounded like an explosion.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">With the first jolt, Bill Swanson
      tumbled out of his bunk on the <I>Badger</I>. He later told the
      Alaska Sportsman that the he could see even the highest mountains
      shaking. Then he saw the Lituya Glacier appear to literally rise
      up into the air.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I know you can't ordinarily
      see that glacier from where I was anchored,&quot; he was quoted
      in the October, 1958 issue. &quot;People shake their head when
      I tell them I saw it that night. I can't help it if they don't
      believe mebut I know what I saw that night.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From his vantage point, he
      could also see the mountainside slide away and crash towards
      the water. From his viewpoint on the other side of the bay, Ulrich
      could see the wave rise up and devastate the forested hillside.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">All three boat crews had been
      woken up by the earthquake. But while the captains of the <I>Badger</I>
      and <I>Edrie </I>were transfixed by the spectacle at the head
      of the bay, the Wagners on the <I>Sunmore</I> jumped to immediate
      action and got their boat headed out of the bay.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It proved to be a fatal decision.
      Swanson reported seeing the <I>Sunmore</I> just about to turn
      out into the entrance when it was caught by the wave and flung
      over Harbor Point across the opening from the end of the spit.
      All that was found later was an oil slick marking the spot where
      the boat went down in deep water.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ulrich told Alaska Sportsman
      that he was &quot;petrified&quot; by the landslide and the wave
      and didn't begin to act until he saw the wave, then still some
      300 feet high engulf Cenotaph Island some two miles away from
      his boat.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;I began to move then,&quot;
      he said. &quot;And I moved fast, cursing myself for not moving
      sooner.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot; I Think We've Had
      It. Goodbye&quot;</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He got a life jacket on his
      son and started the engine. He started to pull the anchor and
      found it unmovable.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;The wave (then estimated
      at more than 75 feet high) was almost upon us and we were fastened
      to the bottom with a heavy chain,&quot; Ulrich said. He surmised
      that the quake had caused the anchor to get tangled on the bottom.
      He let out all his extra chain, in hopes that it would be enough
      to allow the boat to ride up and over the wave. Then he turned
      the boat into the wave and held on.</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      &quot;As the Edrie began her almost perpendicular ascent to the
      crest of the wave, the chain snapped,&quot; Ulrich said, adding
      that he wanted to get a message out so his wife in Pelican would
      eventually find out her husband and son had died. &quot;There
      seemed to be no hope for survivalI grabbed the handset of my
      radiophone and yelled into it: 'Mayday! Mayday! This is the <I>Edrie</I>
      in in Lituya Bay. All hell has broken loose in hereI think we've
      had it. Goodbye.' &quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But the luck that had abandoned
      the Wagners was still on Ulrich's side. At the top of wave, he
      regained enough control of his boat to hold on and steer around
      the debris being carried by the wave. A few seconds later, the
      worst had passed.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">He sent out another message
      saying he thought they'd made it through. Immediately, other
      boats outside Lituya began radioing back. But, Ulrich noted,
      the silence from the <I>Badger</I> and the <I>Sunmore </I>was
      ominous.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Just about the time that Bill
      Swanson saw the wave engulf the <I>Sunmore</I> as it tried to
      escape, the wave - estimated to be approximately 80 feet high
      - hit his boat and carried it over the La Chaussee Spit and dumped
      it stern first into the open ocean.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;We went way over the
      trees and I looked down on rocks as big as an ordinary house
      as we crossed the spit,&quot; Swanson told the Alaska Sportsman.
      &quot;We were way up above them. It felt like we were in a tin
      can and somebody was shaking it.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After the crash landing, the
      boat immediately began to sink. They were surrounded by acres
      of wood debris - including a large tree that smashed through
      the pilot house and broke several of Swanson's ribs - but managed
      to get into eight foot skiff with only their underclothes on,
      according to Fradkin's book. At nearly midnight, they were found
      by the crew of the vessel <I>Lumen </I>which was picking its
      way through the miles of debris looking for signs of survivors
      in the pitch dark.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">After surviving the giant Lituya
      wave, Ulrich continued to fish but then quit the business a year
      later. As recently as 2004, he was still reliving the events
      of July 9, 1958. He wrote a brief story that appeared in Esquire
      magazine about that night under the title &quot;What it Feels
      Like to Survive a Tsunami.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Swansons eventually got
      a replacement boat, but Vivian - whose hair reportedly turned
      gray overnight after the Lituya incident - refused to go fishing
      with Bill again, according to Fradkin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On the night of May 26, 1962.
      Bill Swanson returned to Lituya Bay for the first time since
      the wave in 1958. Shortly after passing through the narrow entrance
      to the bay, he suffered a massive heart attack and died.<BR>
