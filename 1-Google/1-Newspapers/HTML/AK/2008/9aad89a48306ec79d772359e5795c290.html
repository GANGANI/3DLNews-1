      Ice worms, so small and wispy that several would fit on your
      fingertip, live on warmish glaciers, eating algae and slithering
      toward the few spots in the narrow range of temperature they
      can endure. Ice worms die if the temperature drops much below
      freezing. At temperatures comfortable for humans, they disintegrate.<BR>
                 <BR>
      This summer, a few biologists are making a ski-and-crampon trek
      over the glaciers on the south side of the Alaska Range to see
      if rumors are true of the ice worm's existence there. Ice worms
      typically live on warmer glaciers in lower latitudes or near
      the coast of Alaska, not on the colder ice of the Interior. </FONT></P>

      &quot;A worm in Denali would have to be a bit different to survive
      the harsh winters,&quot; said Rutgers professor Dan Shain, a
      trekker and one of the few people who study ice worms.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Shain, Alaska Pacific University
      professor Roman Dial, and a few others are making a ski and packraft
      traverse of the southern Alaska Range this August in search of
      the ice worm. Mountaineers, pilots, and park rangers have reported
      seeing ice worms on glaciers within Denali National Park.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For the past six years, Shain
      has stepped foot on more than 100 glaciers from Oregon to Alaska,
      finding ice worms on level snowfields, steep cones of avalanched
      snow, crevasse walls, hard glacier ice, and glacial rivers and
      pools. The worms are similar in structure to earthworms, but
      an inch-long ice worm is a large one. They are as thin as thread,
      and are super sensitive to temperatures. Ice worms freeze and
      die if their bodies drop just a few degrees below 32 Fahrenheit,
      and dissolve at temperatures warmer than about 40 degrees.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">How does such a fragile creature
      survive? Ice worms stay within glacier ice during the heat of
      the day, but squirm to the surface in the evening. For this reason,
      the group will be on the lookout for worms after 8 p.m. on the
      Denali National Park trip. Nobody knows where ice worms spend
      the winter, but Shain said they probably burrow within ice and
      snow that provides insulation and temperature stability during
      the darkest of days. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      And what does this unlikely creature eat? Shain said the worms
      appear to feed on the single-celled algae that grows on glaciers,
      and may also eat bacteria, fungi, and other organic material
      the wind blows onto glaciers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">During the current trip, the
      biologists will use their mountaineering skills on a traverse
      over glaciers flowing south from the high peaks of the Alaska
      Range. They plan to fly from Talkeetna onto the Eldridge Glacier,
      then ski and walk over glaciers just south of Mt. McKinley, including
      the Buckskin, Ruth, Tokositna and Kahiltna glaciers. Shain spoke
      with a climber who saw Alaska Range ice worms that were small
      enough to fit on his fingernail with room to spare. That body
      size-probably smaller than ice worms on glaciers farther south-might
      be an adaptation to living on colder northern glaciers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If the group finds ice worms,
      Shain will collect several hundred and bring them back to his
      lab in New Jersey to see how different the worms are from those
      living much farther south.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Finding them would be
      great, and would likely mean a new species to science,&quot;
      Shain said. &quot;The alternative (not finding them) is less
      appealing, but that is the risk.&quot;</FONT></P>
