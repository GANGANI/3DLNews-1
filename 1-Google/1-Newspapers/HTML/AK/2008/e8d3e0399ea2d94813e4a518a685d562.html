      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"><BR>
      Ketchikan, Alaska - Ninety years ago on November 23rd, the city
      of Ketchikan let out a collective sigh of relief.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For nearly a month, theaters,
      restaurants, schools and most stores had been closed. City Health
      officer Harry Ayers had forbidden gatherings larger than a handful
      of people. The reason: An attempt to stop the spread of the &quot;Great
      Influenza&quot; in Ketchikan.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On November 23, 1918, the public
      ban on gatherings would be lifted and life would return somewhat
      to normal but many residents would still be affected and some
      local residents were suffering lingering affects as late as the
      summer of 1920.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The influenza had arrived in
      Ketchikan in October, on ships coming from Seattle and Vancouver
      where it had quickly spread. Although it would &quot;only&quot;
      claim around 16 lives in Ketchikan, public health officials would
      later estimate that nearly a third of the more than 2,000 residents
      of the community would come down with influenza that would claim
      more than 50 million lives world-wide in a matter of months.
      </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Modern scientists estimate
      that more than 20 percent of the people on earth had at least
      some symptoms of the &quot;Great Influenza.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The exact cause of the Great
      Influenza has never been precisely pinpointed, although most
      researchers agree that it first appeared in the United States
      in the spring of 1918. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Within months it was spread
      world wide, primarily because of the massive troop movements
      taking place in the latter stages of World War I.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">John Barry, author of the 2004
      book, &quot;The Great Influenza:The Epic Story of the Deadliest
      Plague in History&quot; believes the first signs of the new virulent
      form of the flu appeared in Haskell, County Kansas in February
      of 1918. By early March it had spread to large military encampments
      at Fort Riley and Fort Dodge.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Barry writes that plague was
      different from most of the known flus at the time because it
      tended to strike down young healthy people at a greater rate
      than the traditional targets of the flu: the young, the elderly
      and the already sick.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It was later determined that
      the great influenza inflicted its greatest damage by causing
      the immune systems of people to go into a form of overdrive that
      literally killed them.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Because healthy people had
      stronger immune systems they were more susceptible to the 1918
      influenza. Many died within hours of showing the first symptoms
      &shy; usually an inability to walk, followed by a blueish tint
      to the face and finally the coughing of blood from the lungs.<B></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Headlines Announced
      The Flu Was Coming&quot;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although the first cases of
      the influenza didn't appear in Ketchikan until late in October
      of 1918, residents had had a warning it was coming. Headlines
      in the September 17, 1918 Ketchikan Daily Progressive Miner noted
      that the epidemic was raging in Boston and New York.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By Oct. 12, Seattle officials
      were reporting dozens of deaths.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In mid October, Ketchikan resident
      Author Moa &shy; the adopted god-son of Forest Hunt &shy; wrote
      to his family in Ketchikan from Fort Dodge, Kansas, where he
      had been training for service in Europe since early September.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;There are many cases
      of Spanish influenza in camp and several deaths have occurred
      from it,&quot; he wrote, in the letter that was printed in the
      Oct. 18 edition of the Daily Progressive Miner. &quot;The camp
      is under quarantine now.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">By then most of the coastal
      communities in Alaska were also under quarantine. Territorial
      Governor Thomas Riggs had placed a marine quarantine in place,
      but it was impossible enforce because of the need for supplies
      in the isolated communities.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On October 19, it was reported
      that theaters in San Francisco and Seattle were closed and that
      public gatherings were banned. In the same issue of the Progressive
      Miner, it was reported that the captain of a local fishing vessel
      had just arrived from Prince Rupert and reported that more than
      800 cases of the influenza and eight deaths had occurred there.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Also on the 19th, it was reported
      that pianist at the Dream Theater, Mrs. F.J. Woods, had left
      for Seattle the day before to go to Camp Dodge to take care of
      her husband, who had been stricken with the flu.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Oct. 22, six cases of the
      influenza were reported in Loring and Ketchikan city council
      held an emergency meeting to decide what to do. The Loring cases
      were limited to crew members on the cannery ship Star of England,
      but local officials were concerned that others traveling from
      Loring would spread the disease here.<B></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Officials ordered
      Ketchikan 'Closed'&quot;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The city council chambers were
      packed by citizens worried over the spread of the influenza.
      The council immediately approved the closure of most public operations
      in the city including the &quot;schools, churches, theaters,
      and prohibiting of all public and social gatherings, pool rooms
      and all.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Children were warned to stay
      inside their homes and &quot;special officers have been appointed
      to see that none enter the city without a physician's certificate
      of health.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Daily Progressive Miner
      quoted city mayor A.A Wakefield as saying the city would take
      &quot;every precaution to prevent infection from what ever source,
      at whatever cost and in accord with the principal that an ounce
      of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But it was already too late.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The next day, Dr. Henry Story
      reported to the Daily Progressive Miner that he had already been
      called to attend to several cases of the influenza. At least
      two cases were attributed to a recent arrival on the Princess
      Sophia. Story reported that the strain of the flu thus far appeared
      to be a mild form and that the patients were recovering.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Oct. 25, Story reported
      that two dozen more cases of the flu had been reported and several
      families were completed &quot;infirmed.&quot; Later that day,
      Mayor Wakefield order the public library to be closed int order
      to prevent the transferring of the disease by books.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On the 26th, the city set up
      a &quot;temporary&quot; hospital in the basement of the Methodist
      Church. Dr. Story reported that more than 100 residents were
      now showing signs of the disease and that several were in &quot;very
      serious&quot; condition. Mayor Wakefield asked for volunteers
      to help man the sickbeds and one who stepped up was Main School
      teacher Harriett Rossiter, according to local historian June
      Allen.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Most people were afraid
      to go anywhere near those ill with the dreaded disease,&quot;
      Allen wrote on SITNEWS in 2003. &quot;But Miss Rossiter nursed
      the isolated flu patients in a temporary hospital set up in the
      basement of the Methodist Church on Main Street, earning the
      town's gratitude.&quot;<B></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Villages Also Report
      Epidemic&quot;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Dr. Dickenson also reported
      to the Daily Progressive on the 26th that the influenza had spread
      to several of the villages in the area and that many Natives
      were falling ill.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Also on the 26th, Russel Radenbaugh
      reported in a letter that &quot;all the Ketchikan boys&quot;
      had Camp Dodge were suffering from the flu but that his case
      had been mild.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Unfortunately, here is where
      the historical record has a hole. Two of the three employees
      at the Daily Progressive Miner, Paul Stanhope and Frank Elkins,
      came down with the disease, according to Lew Williams Jr's history
      of Alaskan news papering &quot;Bent Pins to Chains.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Daily Progressive Miner
      apparently stopped publishing until the second week in November.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 14, George Hunter reported
      to the Daily Progressive Miner that seven people had died in
      Hydaburg.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 16, the newspaper reported
      that Hazel Brown of Ketchikan had also died overnight, the fifth
      person to die in Ketchikan. That same day funerals were held
      for Mrs. George Brown and George Reglas.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 17, Dr. Story reported
      that the number of cases &shy; now estimated at more than 900
      &shy; had appeared to have peaked and that only a handful of
      new cases appeared overnight.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 20, the Progressive
      Miner reported that the its printer Frank Elkins had died and
      that he was the eleventh local victim of the influenza.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 22, city officials
      met and decided to lift the quarantine on public gathering. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;At the meeting it was
      evident that the people felt the worst was over and according
      voted &shy; almost unanimously &shy; to lift the ban,&quot; the
      Daily Progressive reported on the public meeting. <B></B></FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">&quot;Theaters 'Influenza
      Free'&quot;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On Nov. 23, theaters were opened
      again and on the 24th, local churches had their first public
      services in more than a month.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The two Ketchikan theaters,
      the Dream and the Grand, both ran large advertisements trumpeting
      the fact that both theaters had been &quot;fumigated, cleaned&quot;
      and were &quot;entirely influenza free.&quot;</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But if the worst was over in
      Ketchikan, the same could not be said in much of the rest of
      Alaska. Nome reported that more than 150 Natives had died in
      nearby villages. Public health officials now estimate that between
      4,000 and 5,000 Alaska Natives may have died in the Great Influenza
      of 1918, approximately 20 percent of the statewide Native population.
      By comparison, an estimated 500 white people died statewide,
      approximately two percent of the white population.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Early on in the epidemic, Territorial
      governor Riggs had traveled to Washington D.C. to seek additional
      funding and additional manpower to deal with the crisis and was
      granted $100,000 and several doctors were sent north. But winter
      had already arrived and they were unable to visit many of the
      isolated villages. When they surveyed the villages in the villages
      in the Spring they found that many of the smaller ones had been
      completely wiped out.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There were similar occurrences
      in Native villages along the British Columbia coast according
      to Prince Rupert Daily News.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Contemporary news accounts
      also indicated that Prince Rupert had been hit harder that Ketchikan
      by the epidemic.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The November 19, 1918 edition
      of the Daily News indicated that the epidemic which peaked in
      Prince Rupert around Oct. 22 had killed more than 35 people and
      sickened over 1,200.</FONT></P>
