<p>The modern world is awash in news.  Every day, we can turn on our computers, flick on the TV or tap on our phones to get the latest updates from locales both far-flung and close to home.</p>
<p>And yet there are still important stories left untold, voices that never enter the media mainstream.  WAMU 88.5 in Washington, D.C. is proud to produce Breaking Ground with Kavitha Cardoza, a documentary series dedicated to those voices, to making the invisible visible by uncovering the stories you won&#8217;t hear anywhere else.  Stories about adults learning how to read and write for the very first time, stories about military children, and stories about students who struggle to graduate from high school. </p>
<p>In all these stories, Kavitha Cardoza brings a dogged commitment to rigorously reported journalism, as well as a compassion that encourages interviewees to open up.   She believes in letting people tell their own stories, and through those stories, challenge our assumptions about the world around us.</p>
<p>Breaking Ground is intelligent, compassionate, and vibrant. It is through respect for each member of our community that Cardoza introduces us to people who need our understanding, and at times, our help.</p>
<p>Letâs start a conversation.</p>
<hr />
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Kavitha Cardoza</h4>
<h6>Host, Breaking Ground</h6>
<p>An experienced journalist, Kavitha Cardoza blends her own storytelling style with amazing stories of resilience and ingenuity. Cardozaâs authentic interest in highlighting the challenges of the poor brings us people who might otherwise be invisible.</p>
<p>Born in Liverpool, England, Kavitha and her family moved back to their native India when she was 7. Cardozaâs father, an eye surgeon, split his time between treating paying patients and treating the poor. Cardoza and her sisters assisted their mother with cooking meals for poor patients, and Cardoza would travel with her mother to pharmacies, negotiating discounted and free prescriptions.</p>
<p>When she first came to the U.S., Cardoza remembers her surprise at the physical separation between the poor and the rest of society, and the inequality this causes. âIn India, the people are blended together. Poor and privileged live side by side.â Cardoza recalls.</p>
<p>She saw this as an opportunity, and Breaking Ground was born. âAfter a story airs highlighting the needs of a person, family, or community, I get calls from listeners asking âhow can I help? People have such open hearts and want to make a difference,â Cardoza notes.</p>
<p>Cardoza began her career in 2002 at WUIS-WIPA Public Radio, University of Illinois at Springfield. There she reported and produced features for the Illinois Public Radio networkâs 11 member stations.</p>
<p>Since 2008, Cardoza has been producing series and documentaries for WAMU on a variety of topics, with an emphasis on education and poverty. Considered an expert on education, she frequently participates on panels and other speaking engagements around the country.<br />
Cardoza is a contributor to NPRâs Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Weekend Edition Saturday, Tell Me More, Latino USA, BBC World News America, Marketplace, Voice of America, PBS NewsHour, The World, The Kitchen Sisters and Radio Slovak.</p>
<p>Cardoza earned masterâs degrees in broadcast journalism from the University of Illinois and in communication from the Manipal Institute of Communication in India. She holds a bachelorâs degree in economics, English literature and psychology from Mount Carmel College in India. She lives in Washington, D.C. and has earned more than 25 awards for her work.</p>
