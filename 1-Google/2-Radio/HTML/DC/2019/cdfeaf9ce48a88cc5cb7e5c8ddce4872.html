She aims for her work to serve as a \u201cvisual voice for the people,\u201d showing all aspects of human life. Her raw and compelling candids expose truth, adversities, beauty, and culture. Dee developed a fascination for photography as a teenager, when she never left the house without a disposable camera to capture daily life of family and friends. But her love for the medium blossomed while taking a black and white photography course in college. She would spend half her days snapping candids and the other half in the dark room, developing her own film. Dee holds a BFA in filmmaking and digital photography, and she continues to live in D.C. with her two children.

\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a marathon.\u201d","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">About 1 in 4 kids growing up in the U.S. lives in a house with one parent, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/short-reads\/2019\/12\/12\/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent\/\">Census Bureau statistics<\/a>, with that number growing to nearly half in Black homes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melissa Kearney is an economics professor at the University of Maryland and the author of <a href=\"https:\/\/press.uchicago.edu\/ucp\/books\/book\/chicago\/T\/bo205550079.html\"><em>Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind<\/em><\/a>, and she says that single parents are strapped for not only cash, but also time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe have mounds of data showing that households that only have one parent as compared to two ,they have much less income coming in.\u201d That, of course, is unsurprising. What those numbers don\u2019t reflect, Kearney says, is that kids growing up in those households are less likely to graduate from high school or college and are more likely to become unmarried parents themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The circumstances of single parenthood also limit the ability of guardians to spend time with their children. \u201cThat probably feels intuitive to anybody who\u2019s tried to raise kids,\u201d Kearney says. \u201cIf you want to drive your kid around to activities or sit down and help your kid with their homework, if there\u2019s not another adult in the house who can help out with those chores, or who is doing the work of bring in income, you just have less time to engage in those sort of childbearing activities.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But despite all of these challenges, single motherhood is the reality for many people. That includes Ward 7 resident Tiffany Browne.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Browne\u2019s road to parenting and career success was not a linear path.\u00a0 She says her late father always predicted that she would grow up to live a \u201cbohemian lifestyle,\u201d but life had other plans. She got pregnant in her mid-20s. At the time, Browne was a student at Howard University. \u201cI was just scared.\u201d She told WAMU photojournalist Dee Dwyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After the birth of her daughter, Browne returned to school and got her degree. But she did not have to do it all on her own. While she returned to the classroom, her mother and late father pitched in to provide childcare.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u201cThe reward for me was to have my daughter at my graduation,\u201d she reflects, sitting at the dining room table of the house where she grew up. The same house where she is now raising her daughter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since her graduation, Browne has grown accustomed to a busy life. \u201cIt\u2019s always sort of a mad dash out the door,\u201d she says of getting her teenage daughter ready for school in the morning before turning to her work as a public relations professional. On top of that she\u2019s a part of the D.C. chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, a non-profit that advocates for Black girls and women. She also volunteers for a local political campaign. All of this career and community involvement coincides with the time commitments she has for her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a marathon, but somehow I manage.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Browne says she makes it through the day by giving herself permission to rest. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come without guilt,\u201d she says. \u201cI think what helped was keeping in mind that you can\u2019t pour from an empty cup.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This month for Voices of Wards 7 and 8, Dwyer spoke with Browne about her journey as a single mother, and her hopes for herself and her daughter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7026776\" style=\"width: 1521px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7026776\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1521\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3-300x249.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3-1024x848.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3-1500x1243.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3-900x746.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/Browne3-600x497.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Tiffany Browne in front of the fireplace in her Ward 7 home.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><em><strong>&#8216;Single mom&#8217; &#8211; what is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear those words? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I hear exhaustion, but I also hear triumph. I also hear legacy, in terms of not necessarily single motherhood, but just in terms of generations of mothers before me within my family and I\u2019m specifically thinking about on my mom&#8217;s side from my mother, grandmother and even my great grandmother, who I was fortunate to know growing up. She passed away when I was 13. Getting that sense of three generations and knowing that I carry that with me is a big thing to me.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What does a day in your life look like for you as a single mom? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty hectic. It&#8217;s funny because in recent months or so, I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out&#8230; how did I get here? Like, I&#8217;ve never been such a workaholic, but I\u2019m at that level, so the typical day is: I get up around between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., get myself together, get my daughter together and ready for school. She&#8217;s in high school, nearby &#8211; she&#8217;s at a Catholic school, they go in a little bit earlier than\u00a0 DCPS or any other neighboring jurisdictions. It&#8217;s always sort of a mad dash, if you will, [to get] out the door.<\/p>\n<p>The blessing is I work with a PR firm that is based in Montgomery County, Maryland. The beauty of this job is I don&#8217;t necessarily have to go in unless I absolutely [must], so if I&#8217;m meeting with the client or if there&#8217;s, a mandatory staff meeting.<\/p>\n<p>But for the most part, I get to work from home, which allows a flexible schedule. Some days can be very intense [where] I&#8217;m sitting here at the dining table, working past 6:00, depending on what a client&#8217;s needs are. I&#8217;m part of the D.C. chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women. If there&#8217;s a committee meeting or if there&#8217;s an event, then I&#8217;m dealing with that. I&#8217;m also, volunteering on a local political campaign. I&#8217;m kind of wearing multiple hats lately and juggling.<\/p>\n<p>If my daughter has something, I&#8217;ve got to go for that, particularly at the school. The school has parents club meetings, and these count towards parent service hours. It&#8217;s pretty much a marathon. Somehow I do manage to get sleep. But then there are times like today &#8211; I&#8217;ve been on deadline for something for work since yesterday. I ran over yesterday, like I finished work about 7 p.m. and gave myself permission to rest and pick the work back up later in the night.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>You mentioned you &#8216;gave yourself permission&#8217; [to rest]. As a single mom, how did you get there? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t come without guilt, because I think one of the things that we deal with &#8211; as single moms &#8211; is guilt, specifically when we take our attention away from our child or our children, and we want to give that attention to ourselves. What helps is keeping in mind, &#8216;you can&#8217;t pour from an empty cup&#8217;. You just can&#8217;t, because you&#8217;re no good to yourself or to your child or children.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you at the exact moment, but I do remember coming to terms with myself because, again, as much as I love my mother and loved how she raised me, her generation viewed motherhood and parenting a little different. It&#8217;s more like you&#8217;re sacrificing everything, your whole self, just to make sure your child is okay. While I appreciate that, part of my heart hurts for my mom because when her and I have conversations, I do wonder, was there anything for herself that she wanted to go after?<\/p>\n<p>I know for me, once I became a mom, now that I think about it, I probably did subconsciously say that I&#8217;m not going to sacrifice my full self just for the sake of my child. Like, yes, I want my daughter to have the best life that I can give her, even if it&#8217;s better than my own. But at what cost? I&#8217;m not going to fully let myself go. Now that my daughter is a teenager, is a little bit older and self-sufficient, I do make it a conscious decision. &#8216;Well, mommy is going to go out with her girls tonight.

Not only do you become a mom in your twenties, but a single mom. Can you take us back to those days? When was the moment you realized, &#8216;It&#8217;s all on me.&#8217;?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was in college, at Howard University. I was a commuter student, my only regret is I didn&#8217;t actually live on campus, I still sort of was starting to come into my own. I had a job in the federal government. I was, also majoring in journalism. Around that same time, <em>Sex in the City<\/em> was a big show. Pretty much every Black woman that was in the field at the time or emerging, such as myself, we all wanted to become the Black Carrie Bradshaw even before we realized Carrie could be a jerk sometimes. We just loved that lifestyle of being single, dating, having fun with your friends. For me, I wasn&#8217;t into turning up too much because, being from here (D.C.), a lot of my friends who were the same age as I went away to school.<\/p>\n<p>At some point, I meet my daughter&#8217;s father. We started dating, for like a year. In hindsight, I realize our relationship was toxic. That was a tribute to our age at that time, being in our twenties and still trying to figure things out. We had a daughter, and by that time, I had taken a break from Howard&#8230; there was a lot going on with me.\u00a0 Around that time 9-11 hit, and I was doing a journalism internship. Everything I wrote about was [on] the aftermath and the recovery taking place at the Pentagon. That really drained me.<\/p>\n<p>The moment I knew I was going to be a single mom&#8230; I initially didn&#8217;t make any attempt to do child support. I just figured based off the conversations that I was having with her father at the time, that he knew that this was also his responsibility, and he knew what he needed to do. At this point I&#8217;m not working. My family was helping me out, I was on WIC, [and] whatever little assistance I could get at the time until I could figured out what my next move was going to be.<\/p>\n<p>My daughter was running low on Similac, [or it] might have been diapers or something. Rather than turn to my parents, I said, &#8216;You know what, she has a father.&#8217; I remember I went to him twice. Asking him the first time, he was like, &#8216;Okay, I got you my payday.&#8217; His payday came, there was no assistance. Finally he came out with all these different excuses of why he couldn&#8217;t help at that time. I was frustrated and was just like, &#8216;You know what? I&#8217;m not going to go through this again.&#8217;\u00a0 Knowing the toxic relationship that we had, I was just like, &#8216;No, I&#8217;m going to hold his feet to the fire.&#8217; That&#8217;s when I went and did child support. That was my realization of\u00a0 &#8216;Tiff you\u2019re really doing this by yourself. He&#8217;s already shown you that he is unable to step up and step in like you need him to.&#8217; I have always remained fair in this situation. I never turned bitter or anything.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I did go back to Howard, I had one year to finish. I graduated, freelanced for a while, and then eventually got a stable job. I&#8217;ve been on a upward trajectory ever since.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What\u2019s your outlook for the next five years? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>All I know is next year my daughter graduates from high school. She&#8217;ll be 18, I&#8217;ll be 45. I feel like the world will be my oyster. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out, &#8216;What does that exactly mean? What does that look like for me?&#8217; Particularly around dating. I&#8217;m slowly but surely trying to dip my toe in the dating pool. Which is&#8230; an adventure. I do desire to be married. So hopefully, I don&#8217;t know, maybe I&#8217;ll luck up and end up being married.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Is there anything else that you want to leave us with<\/strong>?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I will just say that motherhood, as much as I love my daughter, has been interesting [and] entertaining. It&#8217;s been a rollercoaster ride. I would just say, &#8216;Just hold on to your seats, ladies.

The given name is Thomas, last name \u201cGoode\u201d \u2013 not in Hollywood, but in my neighborhood. The nickname is Kokamoe, the reason why it\u2019s called a nickname is because a person named Nick gave me that name (laughs).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>How do you get the name Kokamoe? \u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gambling (craps).\u00a0 \u2018Little Joe from Kokomo,\u201d that\u2019s what everybody says when they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.casinocitytimes.com\/linda-mabry\/article\/deciphering-the-language-of-craps-26214\">gambling<\/a>. The point four for \u2018Little Joe, from Kokomo\u2019. I always liked to gamble when I was younger and that was my favorite, point four. So I just kept the name \u201cLittle Joe from Kokomo\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>What do you do for a living? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m an electrical contractor. I turn on lights and put in plugs. That\u2019s going to always have some type of living, especially with your own business. As with me being an electrical contractor, I want to give some of these youngins and some other people [the opportunity] to learn electrical skills. When they go on a job from my training, at least they\u2019ll be able to know what they\u2019re doing and understand what goes on in life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I think I\u2019ve been doing electrical work [for] 32 years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Did you grow up seeing art in your community? How did we get here?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t even know. I think that came from back when I would listen to my grandmother. She used to be singing in her church, church music! She would be singing at night in church, singing her church songs.\u00a0\u00a0But I\u2019m just listening because most of the time I\u2019m on punishment and not going out.\u00a0But as I\u2019m listening to her, I can hear some melody and tone, and then I could hear my mother and them downstairs, they\u2019re cranking too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I\u2019m indulged in all the music, but at the same time, I\u2019m looking at their lifestyle like, damn, they\u2019re good but they\u2019re doing grown-up stuff. The main thing I took on was the singing. Somebody [could] be arguing, and next thing you know a song comes on, and they\u2019re all back in rhythm.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>When did you first start rapping?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was at Capitol Cab. They had a DJ outside, you know how they have those little functions at the park. Everybody had a function at the park. So this DJ, he was playing his oldies but goodies, everybody wasn\u2019t up to tempo. [While there] I sang \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xag5RKD0VHk\">the family affair<\/a>\u2018 song.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody loved for me to sing that song every time they came around, then they started to pay me for it. That\u2019s how I started. When I was singing it, I can see [that] everybody was amazed because [it] looked like we were all a family.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think it is about your message that makes people smile and be in rhythm?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The way I see it is, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s presented \u2013 because it can be said any type of way.\u00a0 But you can feel it, how a person says something.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Why the bus..how did you get there?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to drive without a license, I got my license taken a long time ago. I\u2019ll never forget the time I had a customer with me, and it was hot, and the police pulled me over. They made us walk on the highway. So from that point on, I said \u2018Man it ain\u2019t even worth driving no more. Why\u2026I keep getting caught up!\u2019 So I started catching a bus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So as I\u2019m getting on the bus, the little kids just be so disrespectful and so \u2018woo woo woo\u2019. I go to the back and all the kids be loud. And I say, \u2018You say something, I\u2019ma fry you up. You say something I\u2019ma fry you up. She say something I\u2019ma fry her up. Any one of y\u2019all say something and I\u2019ma fry somebody up.\u2019\u00a0 And then they\u2019re all quiet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they\u2019re quiet I decide to pick on them anyway and I start rapping. And as I start rapping\u2026the best thing about it is I can rap without cussing. And I was rapping about everything they had on, everything from each one of them. And they used to love that. They used to get on the bus and say \u2018Kokomoe fry me up, fry me up.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0They used to love that. \u00a0They understood my terminology. The kids started being late for school. Just so they would go to school, I\u2019d get off the bus where their school was.<\/p>\n<p>Then the kids were being late for school, that\u2019s what really made them [teachers] mad. I\u2019d get off the bus where their school was [so they can go in]. A lot of those kids that have graduated have become rappers. A lot of them have done things off my influence, they\u2019ll tell you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>D.C. legend and longtime rapper Kokamoe freestyles at the X2 bus stop as a fan looks on. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-13.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe boards the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-4.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe freestyling on the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-6.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe waiting for the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe freestyles at the X2 bus stop.<span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><em><strong>When was that moment that you noticed you started receiving love in the city?

I\u2019ve always got to be active \u2013 up doing something, moving around,\u201d says Harvey during breaks in a workout at his home gym in Capitol Heights, Md.<\/p>\n<p>Harvey began competing nine years ago, and when he\u2019s preparing for a boxing match almost every day starts the same: He\u2019s up early in the morning for exercise \u2013 maybe a run or jump roping, followed by strength training. Afterwards, he has a light breakfast (either oatmeal or eggs \u2013 but he does love his cereal).<\/p>\n<p>By the afternoon, though, Harvey\u2019s busy either sparring or hitting the bags.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5002339\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5002339\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1142\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Featherweight boxer Jahmal Harvey trains at The Campus gym in Capitol Heights, Md. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>This steadfast lifestyle has paid off for Harvey \u2013 in October he became <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usaboxing.org\/news\/2023\/october\/27\/four-team-usa-boxers-qualify-to-paris-2024-olympics\">the first male boxer for Team USA<\/a> to qualify for the upcoming Olympics in Paris, after winning gold at the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile. But the 21 year-old from Oxon Hill, Md., says he never expected to become a world contender when he first picked up the gloves.<\/p>\n<p>At 12 years-old, Harvey\u2019s youth football coach introduced him to boxing in between seasons.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTruth be told, when I first started boxing, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cAnd then football season came around. I was like, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want it to stop boxing.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since then, Harvey has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teamusa.com\/profiles\/jahmal-harvey-1147400\">won multiple national championships<\/a>. In 2021, he became a world champion when he won the gold for the featherweight division. Throughout that time, and even now, Harvey is still technically considered an amateur in the sport. But he\u2019s come a long way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Italy, Bulgaria, Ecuador and Great Britain, Finland, Czech Republic, Germany,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cIt feels good to compete on that world level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Harvey, going to the Olympics this summer means he\u2019ll be up against some of the best boxers in the world. \u201cIt keeps you grounded because you\u2019ve always got to be at the top of your game, because you can lose at any given time,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-11.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Coach Darrell Davis helps boxer Jahmal Harvey put his gloves on to train. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-7.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s levels to boxing.

He\u2019s getting bigger.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not only does Harvey need to maintain his weight, but he needs to continuously increase his athletic and pugilistic skills, too. To do this, his coaches make him spar one-on-one with other high-level athletes, or with multiple partners, a different person each round. Fresh \u201cbodies,\u201d as coach Darrell Davis calls them, ready to push Harvey to his limits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s levels to boxing. So you got to keep leveling up.

He\u2019s done a lot that a lot of people can dream [of, but] that they couldn\u2019t do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Harvey might be one of the best amateur boxers in the United States, he is humble, and often credits his coaches and his family for his success \u2013 or downplays it. When asked if he remembers the moment he realized <em>how <\/em>good of a competitor he is, Harvey replies that he\u2019s more concerned with his next challenge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m doing big things but it\u2019s always more things to accomplish,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cSo it\u2019s, \u2018Am I good enough to do that?\u2019 There\u2019s always moving on to the next thing, not staying complacent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To some, that might come in contrast to the braggadocio that is stereotypical of the boxing world, but humility seems natural for Harvey. He doesn\u2019t shy away from sharing that he lost a few fights last year, which motivated him to get better. He even offers advice to aspiring boxers \u2013 kids that he knows might be looking towards him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard days where you\u2019re going to want to quit. It\u2019s all about dedication. Staying dedicated in the gym. Just pushing yourself to the max and then just keep on going,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared to learn how to take an L, so you could take some wins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, Harvey <em>is<\/em> a tough competitor, but he\u2019s also an easy going young man. And like most 21 year-olds, he likes to spend time with his family and friends \u2013 including a birthday trip to Las Vegas last month.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5002338\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5002338 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1146\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jahmal Harvey sits with his brother, Amir Lee (left) and Kennedy Pullen-Davis (top right), daughter of his coach Darrell Davis. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He enjoys playing video games, watching football, and going out to bowl or golf. Harvey also reads lots of books. In particular, mystery and thriller novels, much to his parents\u2019 and coaches\u2019 surprise. Though, he argues the genre helps with his focus and gives his mind a break from boxing. \u201cI feel like reading is the most therapeutic for me,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, Harvey <em>really<\/em> likes his cereal. His favorite brand right now is cinnamon oat crunch Cheerios. Still, he remains disciplined, even when it comes to his favorite foods.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI be having to cut that out \u2013 because it\u2019s like so sugary \u2013 once I [need to] make weight,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cBut I\u2019ll work out five times to get me a bowl of cereal, anytime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite Harvey\u2019s tenacity and accomplishments, he still has a literal Olympian task ahead of him. He says it can be hard to maintain the discipline he needs, but he doesn\u2019t have to look far to keep motivated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be better for myself and do better for me,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cThen another aspect is just family. Like waiting to have my whole family financially stable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a competitive boxer, there is a living and prize money to be made from the sport. Harvey, a self-described \u201cfamily man,\u201d says he doesn\u2019t want to change his lifestyle much. He just wants to give back to his loved ones so that they can live comfortably, instead of working overtime and worrying about bills, mortgage payments, and car notes.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5002314\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5002314 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/12\/Dee-Dwyer_Jahmal-Harvey-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than boxing.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Go-Go Museum and Caf\u00e9 has been a long time coming. Anti-violence activist Ronald Moten, who\u2019s behind the forthcoming museum in Anacostia, has spoken publicly about his idea for a place that would celebrate the history and culture of go-go music for at least five years. But ask him about it directly, and Moten will say that the work to create this museum began decades ago.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNone of this stuff just happened,\u201d Moten tells DCist\/WAMU. \u201cThis was a vision and a fight with others to make it happen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moten is referring to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-11-18\/go-go-is-the-sound-of-anti-gentrification-in-d-c\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal battles<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> between go-go supporters and lawmakers in the 1990s and 2000s, when the D.C.

The forthcoming 6,000-square-foot museum and caf\u00e9 will be a site where visitors \u2014 particularly, young people \u2014 can learn about the genre\u2019s roots in the drum traditions in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/washingtoncitypaper.com\/article\/187566\/motherland-connection-gogo-goes-to-africa\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">African<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/timeline.carnegiehall.org\/genres\/go-go\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latin<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> music and engage with the work of legendary D.C. performers like Chuck Brown and\u00a0 Backyard Band. Musicians will have access to the building\u2019s recording studio and performance stages, while community members will be able to take culinary lessons in its test kitchen or find a moment of peace in the community garden.

But he also says he\u2019s gotten all the necessary permits approved (\u201cthe hardest thing I ever had to do in my life\u201d) and that he\u2019s not phased by the naysayers: \u201cMost of the time when I do something, people tell me I can\u2019t do it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moten is planning for an April 2024 grand opening of the museum \u2014 exactly five years after he and go-go scholar Natalie Hopkinson kickstarted the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/04\/09\/this-is-the-sound-of-florida-and-georgia-avenue-go-go-fans-are-trying-to-bring-the-music-back-to-metro-pcs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#DontMuteDC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movement that fought to keep go-go music playing outside in Shaw.

It\u2019s a way to always make sure that the culture stays where it\u2019s supposed to be. A museum is a historical place that people can actually come to and connect to what\u2019s going on in Ward 8. So to me it\u2019s Southeast, Southside \u2013 for the Go-Go Museum \u2013 nowhere better it should have been than right here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean, listen, this is us. This is who we are. This is our culture. This is what we grew up on. And it\u2019s about time that we literally have a place that we can say represents our culture, our music, who we are. No matter how gentrified these spaces may get, this is always going to be here. They\u2019re going to know what go-go is and they\u2019re going to know that we\u2019re here to stay.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5001085\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1654px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5001085 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/11\/DCist_Voices_GoGo-Museum_Opening-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1654\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Clarence Johnson at The Go-Go Museum groundbreaking and launch of the traveling go-go museum and stage. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Clarence Johnson\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means history.

We can keep this in our community amongst ourselves, amongst our family and kids.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To me, art speaks for itself. Art tells a story of its own. We\u2019re all artists in one way or another. You can be a photographer \u2013 you\u2019re telling a story through your art; in a museum it\u2019ll have our history about go-go, about how we were raised and came up on go-go music. We\u2019re trying to spread it across the nation, from country to country, from city to city, state to state, continent to continent. We want it to be worldwide.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5001086\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5001086 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/11\/DCist_Voices_GoGo-Museum_Opening-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1233\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Dantes Augustin at The Go-Go Museum groundbreaking and launch of the traveling go-go museum and stage. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Dantes Augustin\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-Go means a lot to me because the revolution started with the beat of the drum, and it was illegal to have the drum in your possession \u2013 when they beat the drum all the warriors heard the call, and they attacked the colonizers. But to make it known, the drum is mystical, it\u2019s voodoo, it has ancestral guidance. You could speak to your ancestors through the drums if you only knew how to connect with them. The higher spirits, the divine ones, the departed ones, they communicate with drums. When you want to celebrate them, honor them, you beat the drum. In Africa, this is where our forefathers came \u2013 with the drum, and they knew how to beat it and [how] to communicate with the highest spirit. \u00a0So, this is where it all started!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go-go is D.C.\u2019s favorite, number one music. When you listen to the beat, your body must move. You can\u2019t sit down because it has that effect \u2013 is electrical, it\u2019s energy, it\u2019s synergy and its power. \u00a0It\u2019s magnetic, it gravitates people. It\u2019s an ambiance, it\u2019s a celebration, it\u2019s Chocolate city!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0As you know, they had an ordinance [for] noise in D.C. for playing go-go on Georgia by the Howard Hospital. And this is nonsense! To have a museum just like the Smithsonian \u2013 it\u2019s a great privilege. To be in your own community, with your own art, with your own talent, with your own artists that bring youth awareness and teach the youth the value of music, the value you have in your art..We have our own museum; we could do the biggest show for the youth and stop the gun violence because go-go\u2019s going to provide opportunities for them so they won\u2019t be on the street. We give them music, we give them art, fine arts, and we\u2019ll give them radio because We Act Radio is next door to it. It\u2019s collaboration! You have designers that\u2019s going to display in our museum just like the colonizer\u2019s museum. But ours is going to have flavor.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Go-go music is finally getting a dedicated museum in D.C.

Roy Wilkins, the executive director of the NAACP, and Bayard Rustin, a key organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, <a href=\"https:\/\/mondoweiss.net\/2018\/12\/rights-movements-israel\/\">were among critics<\/a>. The SNCC statement was also criticized for its accompanying drawings of a dollar sign inside the Star of David, which evoked anti-semitic tropes. In 1975, Rustin and others, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1975\/09\/12\/archives\/blacks-organize-proisrael-group-committee-seeks-to-counter-un.html\">created<\/a> Black Americans to Support Israel Committee, an organization aiming to stop anti-Israel and anti-semitism among Black people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJewish Americans supported us, marched with us and died for the cause of racial freedom,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1975\/09\/12\/archives\/blacks-organize-proisrael-group-committee-seeks-to-counter-un.html\">reportedly said<\/a> A.

Gay recalls going to the Western Wall with a group of college students and the Israel Defense Forces stopping only the visibly brown person to ask a series of questions. (Israeli security has limited Palestinians\u2019 access to the Western Wall Plaza, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/reports\/2016-report-on-international-religious-freedom\/israel-and-the-occupied-territories\/israel-and-the-occupied-territories-the-occupied-territories\/#:~:text=The%20authorities%20permitted%20both%20Muslims,Wall%20were%20separated%20by%20gender.\">according <\/a>to the U.S. State Department.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt became very clear to me that that was a version of stop and frisk, but at one of the holiest sites in the world,\u201d Gay tells DCist\/WAMU. \u201cIt was considered fine. It was considered rational and okay and helping Israel meet its security needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gay says the Israeli government\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/23924319\/israel-palestine-apartheid-meaning-history-debate\">policies toward Palestinians in occupied territories<\/a>, restricting their movement and limiting their right to vote, brought to mind the U.S. government\u2019s treatment of Black Americans under Jim Crow laws and segregation. Gay\u2019s time in Jerusalem complicated her pre-existing views; she says she was raised going to a church that portrayed Israel exclusively in a positive light and facilitated holy land tours.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can still love and want all the safety in the world for the [Jewish] people I know and also want everyone in this world to live free from segregation, to live free from state violence,\u201d Gay says.<\/p>\n<p>Another Black organizer in D.C., Derecka Purnell, who is a part of The Dream Defenders, traces the start of her activism for Palestinian human rights back to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2014\/08\/13\/us\/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html\"> 2014 Ferguson protests.<\/a> Purnell, who was raised in St. Louis County, says Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer a few minutes from her home. The killing spurred Purnell, along with many other protesters, to take to the streets in the Missouri suburb to demand justice for Black lives.<\/p>\n<p>Purnell recalls how Palestinians supported Ferguson protesters during their uprising, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/ferguson-gaza_n_5679923\">sharing advice on social media<\/a> on how to respond to police deploying military tactics. Palestinians themselves also protested in Ferguson, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2018\/11\/another-ferguson-protester-bassem-masri-has-died.html\">including the late Bassem Masri<\/a>. Almost a decade later, Purnell found herself organizing an event at a D.C. art gallery, the Culture House, titled \u201cDear Gaza: Love Notes on Black and Palestinian Solidarity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The event was earlier this month, on the night of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.palestine-studies.org\/en\/node\/1654576#:~:text=On%20Nov.4%20an%20estimated,for%20Palestine%20in%20U.S.%20history.\">the country\u2019s largest Pro-Palestine protest to date<\/a>. Hundreds of thousands of people <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/11\/06\/dc-protest-ceasefire-gaza\/\">gathered at Freedom Plaza<\/a> to call attention to Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, including dozens of Black activists who met outside the Wilson Building. Some of those protesters went to Culture House afterwards for rest and reflection.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for Black and Palestinian people to come together to think about the way that our struggle has been united,\u201d Purnell tells DCist\/WAMU. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use culture to tell the stories of our resistance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the Culture House gathering, several Palestinians read poetry they wrote about the Israel-Hamas war to the crowd, many still wearing their keffiyeh scarves and holding their signs.

Charles Turner, 74, will be working with a group of grandparents who help people experiencing mental health crises. Irene Picot, 64, will be practicing her aqua aerobics \u2013 and trying to turn others on to the exercise too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, they\u2019ll be busy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI hope to have a safe, wonderful, prosperous, serving summer,\u201d says Janice Alston Mason, whose agenda for the next few months includes going to church, spending time with her family and friends, and connecting with youth in her community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elders of Wards 7 and 8 find themselves pouring into their communities year round, but especially in the summer \u2013 whether it\u2019s 10-year-old children in their neighborhood or 80-year-old residents at their senior wellness center. For Janice, Charles, Deyanne, and Irene, this isn\u2019t anything out of the norm, especially after raising kids and grandkids. But in between working at a camp, counseling families, or advocating for the benefits of water aerobics, they\u2019ll also be taking time to just\u2026have fun.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur trips are to explore the arts, nutrition, and shopping,\u201d says Deyanne, who visits <a href=\"https:\/\/dacl.dc.gov\/service\/senior-centers\">Washington Seniors Wellness Center<\/a> on Alabama Avenue in Ward 7. \u201cWe\u2019re FANS \u2013 Fun, Arts, Nutrition, and Shopping.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She and her peers recently saw a play at Anacostia Playhouse, and on other trips, they\u2019ve gone out to Baltimore to visit museums, shop, and try new restaurants. The programming is done through the Washington Seniors Wellness Center \u2013 a center run out of D.C.\u2019s Department of Aging and Community Living. Across all residents, they agree that the city needs to increase funding for senior programs, but should seek advice from the seniors themselves as to what they want out of them.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI guess its the age old thing that at some point everyone feels, when you reach a certain age you revert back into immaturity\u2026so it gets to a point where everyone thinks they know what\u2019s best for seniors, well, better than seniors know what\u2019s best for us\u2026If you\u2019re going to spend some money on us, this is what we want you to spend it on,\u201d says Charles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is evident when programming doesn\u2019t meet the wants or needs of the community it\u2019s supposed to serve, he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI guess to put a point poetically, when you are approaching the autumn and winter of your life, there is not a lot of thought towards summer,\u201d Charles adds . \u201cAnd I guess the powers that be, people don\u2019t think about what a senior is going to do for the summer.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this edition of Voices of Wards 7 and 8,\u00a0 we spoke to elders about summer \u2013 their plans, memories, and favorite parts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4989192\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1537px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4989192 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/Dee-Dwyer_Elders_Voices-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1537\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Janice Alston <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Janice Alston\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I live in Ward 8. I\u2019m a retired, proud, paraprofessional.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went back to school at a late age and I even made the Dean\u2019s list, which was wonderful.\u00a0 Before I started working, I volunteered at Leckie elementary school \u2013 I volunteered for 10 years.\u00a0 You can always be of service \u2013 because that\u2019s my number one, my faith in God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My grandmother lived to be 104 and we stand on the backs of all those that have gone before us. So I tried to instill compassion, love, fellowship, giving, serving and being of service into mine. I\u2019ve got three fine sons and I instilled that in them, [so] then they instill that into their families.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This summer I\u2019m going to do activities with my church and spend time with family and friends. We\u2019re probably going to do more things outside. Even though we have some of the violence and stuff, we trust that God will cover us. And we need more people to do a lot of things with their kids.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I wish they would bring back some of the things that did work [with kids]. I went to a recreation center and and felt safe. And when you open the trade schools back, and the recreation centers \u2013 man them with people that really, really have the heart for the students and the seniors as well, that\u2019s what they need. We need something, especially for the summer when kids are out of school and the people aren\u2019t at home so the kids won\u2019t feel like they have to be trapped there in their house.<\/p>\n<p>Me, I live right down the street \u2013 they used to call it \u2018Alexander Gardens\u2019. And I spend just about all my retirement paying my rent. But thank God for my family and for getting some services, I know that will help in the summertime as well.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4989196\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4989196 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/Dee-Dwyer_Elders_Voices-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1188\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Charles Turner <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Charles Turner\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I plan for this summer \u2013 well, as well as we can plan these days, I\u2019m working with this organization that at one time was called \u2018grandparents in favor of COVID-19 vaccination.\u2019 When that scare or that panic subsided as much as it has, we morphed into \u2018grandparents who are dealing with people who have mental health challenges.\u2019 Then there\u2019s an organization from Zimbabwe who has a program called Friendship Bench. Their program consists of training people to help people who are in mental health crisis or having mental health challenges. They want to set up a model program here in D.C., where we might use the same techniques.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have three levels of training \u2013 where [they teach] lay people to sit and have a place on a bench, an actual physical bench \u2013\u00a0 where people can come up through by arranging appointment times, or maybe we\u2019re just sitting there where people will know that there\u2019s somebody they can come and sit down and talk with, maybe just cause a lot of people just need somebody to empathize with them.\u00a0 And once we identify the area of their challenge, their\u00a0 mental health challenge, we can refer them to the appropriate person or program or system to help them meet that challenge.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we need is more summer programs. There is a program that the department of parks and recreation runs, a summer program, where they have a senior camp for seniors for a week, and they have a couple of sessions of that. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary to do for the summer. I guess to put it poetically, when you are approaching the autumn and winter of your life, there\u2019s not a lot of thought towards summer. And I guess the powers that be don\u2019t think about what a senior is going to do for the summer. The senior camp program, that came about because the mayor gave money to parks and recreation to set up senior program, but they don\u2019t come to us and ask us what we\u2019d like to do for the summer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0A resource we would need the most is for them to give us not only a seat at the table to determine what we need or what we want, but also [for us to] be part of the determining factor on what is prioritized, and how the resources or funding or whatever they give towards us doing something for the summer is applied. They come around and ask us what we want, but we never hear anymore about it until something appears. To me it\u2019s like the tail wagging the dog, you know?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I guess it\u2019s the age old thing, that at some point everyone feels that when you reach a certain age, you revert back into, I guess, immaturity. So it gets to a point where everyone thinks they know what\u2019s best for seniors, well, better than the seniors. A lot of them, a lot of us, are comfortable in our retirement \u2013 and feel that we put up the fight and don\u2019t need to spend a whole lot of energy this way.<em>\u00a0<\/em>But some of us still want to determine what\u2019s best for us. And if you\u2019re going to spend some money on us, this is what we want to spend it on, you know, and this is what we think you ought to spend it on first.<em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4989198\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1652px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4989198 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/Dee-Dwyer_Elders_Voices.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1652\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Deyanne Nicholas <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Deyanne Nicholas\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am a native Washingtonian. I spent most of my life in Ward seven and eight. I attend the Washington Seniors Wellness Center. I\u2019m 73, and I accept the title of being a senior. And kudos to those who have lived long enough to be super seniors, those I classify maybe in the upper eighties and nineties, and of course, a hundred.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The D.C. weather in the summer can be a killer, almost. It gets very hot and humid here, but I love it. I was blessed to have selected a profession that took advantage of summer weather. I\u2019ve retired after 45 years with D.C.\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation \u2013 and summer camps, and the swimming pools were our golden stars. I\u2019m still onboard as a seasonal employee. I am looking forward to this summer, being a camp monitor at some of the day camps in southeast and nearby northeast. I just got my passport back. I\u2019ll do some traveling, I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m planning to do some traveling.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Can you share a bit about your most memorable summer?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love the spring as well. I will share with you a memorable spring. I have lost a dear cousin who is like a sister, I\u2019m an only child, but she had a sister. We all took a road trip to Georgia to see other family members and it was awesome.\u00a0 It was great. It was bad! We had big fun and we were also celebrating our birthdays in March, so I really wanted to share that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Do you feel as though the seniors in your community are provided enough resources to enjoy the recreational activities in the summertime throughout the city? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the seniors need transportation to the centers. So, if transportation services could be improved upon that would be great. Our facility, which is the original senior wellness enter in the area, could use some upgrades, improvements, and enlargements. So that would be welcomed.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4989191\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4989191 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/Dee-Dwyer_Elders_Voices-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1251\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Irene Picot <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Irene Picot\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always do something for the summer.

Just to be a D.C. resident, you can go anywhere in D.C., and you have a good time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we can get the crime down, get security\u2026 better security everywhere for the seniors and then get these children out with these guns, it will be a better summer.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4989193\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1613px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4989193 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/Dee-Dwyer_Elders_Voices-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1613\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Wynona Ford <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Wynona Ford<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This (Washington Seniors Wellness Center) is where I come to exercise and we go on trips, and I\u2019m loving it.

We can choose to love despite anything that faces us. Love is a protector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you stick with a person through thick and thin, ups or downs; that\u2019s love,\u201d\u00a0 Ward 8 Resident Joseph Patrick says of his life with his partner of 23 years, Elvera Patrick.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t spell it L-O-V-E, you spell it [with] devotion [and] caring.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Black love adds another intersection to that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBlack love is the ability to love yourself out loud unapologetically,\u201d Ward 8 resident Alejaibara Badu says. \u201cI had to learn love and Blackness, being an eighties baby \u2013\u00a0 being dark in my melanin form. I was born in the South, so everybody wasn\u2019t happy about Blackness. Being a man and being Black also meant that I had to learn how to make myself safe.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love comes out of necessity in a world that doesn\u2019t always love us back. The scarcity of love can take different forms too. Lack of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/11\/13\/ward-8-gets-a-second-supermarket\/\">physical and financial<\/a> investment in Black communities, open discrimination towards Black people, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/what-is-internalized-racism-2834958\">internalized hatred<\/a> we\u2019re socialized to believe. Black love fills what hatred takes away, and allows our community to appreciate each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEvery time I see a Black woman with natural hair, I compliment her; I go out of my way to compliment her,\u201d Kymone Freeman, co-founder of the Black Luv festival, says. \u201cNot in a \u2018pull-up on her\u2019 manner, but just giving her love because she\u2019s probably been exposed to the Westernized ideology of what beauty\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we have to choose to love ourselves, to love each other, and fight to protect ourselves and our community. And it\u2019s not a given. Black love is something that is learned and practiced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got to show love and be open to love before you can give it out and talk to other people about love,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have felt it yourself, and then you\u2019ll know what to give out to a person.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does Black love look like in Wards 7 and 8?

It started for me, the term came into my lexicon, October 16, 1995 at the Million Man March, where I hugged more men than I hugged in my entire life before or since.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine being like a hard rock and you come out there with your boys and you\u2019re taunting the police. We were smoking weed in front of the police and drinking in front of the police daring them to do something because we know it ain\u2019t happening that day, right? And there\u2019s this brother who came up to us and he said, brothers we\u2019re not (N word) today, just for the day we\u2019re not (N word).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That just threw me for a mind trip because I had never ever entertained thought that I was not a (N word). I just assumed I was because everybody said I was. My environment had already determined that for me. That day, he gave me the realization that I had a choice \u2013 I could choose be a (N word) or not \u2013 I never signed up for this shit. And then so we got into the theme of the day, you know, we put the drinks away, put the weed away, and really started paying attention to what\u2019s really going on. When I say I hugged more men in my life, that was therapeutic, and then we were charged to go back to our community and do something. So, I walked around like, what am I going to do?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I said I\u2019m going to do a <a href=\"https:\/\/blackluvfest.com\/\">Black love festival<\/a> in Washington, D.C. Tupac had been assassinated, Biggie got assassinated. I was a witness to a homicide when my cousin was stabbed to death. I was like, the party\u2019s over. It ain\u2019t fun anymore, I\u2019m not a (N word).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the anniversary of Tupac\u2019s assassination, September 30th, 1997, I did a Black love festival at Fort Dupont Amphitheater. Fast Forward, 25 years later, we just did the anniversary back at Fort DuPont Amphitheater, and it was the biggest event we ever done. Thousands of people were there, 10,000 people were there. We had the biggest artists. We had a Jumbotron out there. You know, we honored our elders, everybody had a good time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love is everything. It is Afrofuturism. It is <a href=\"https:\/\/ayeeko.africa\/blogs\/blog\/sankofa-sankofa-symbol-and-meaning\">Sankofa<\/a>, looking back. It is the underpinnings <a href=\"https:\/\/www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org\/kujichagulia.html\">Kujichagulia<\/a>, self-determination. It is our saving grace. It is our resurrection, if we embrace it, it will solve all our problems if we just realize that we need to practice it in some shape form and matter every single day.<\/p>\n<p>If I see a Black woman with natural hair, I\u2019ll go out of my way to compliment her. Not in a pull up on her type of manner, but just giving her love. Because I know that she\u2019s probably has been exposed to the westernized ideology of what beauty is supposed to be, she might not have heard that before. And so that\u2019s Black love. So I think Black love is the biggest threat to the institution of white supremacy, and we need to embrace the program.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>How often do you see Black love in Wards 7 and 8?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, it\u2019s funny, because the answer that you would expect is \u2018Not often, you know this is bleak, and we\u2019re in a high crime area, there\u2019s a lot of violence.\u2019 Since I\u2019ve been here, I know of four people who\u2019ve been murdered on this block. Martin Luther King said \u201cOnly in the darkness can you see the stars\u201d. So having said that, when I see random acts of kindness or random acts of Black love, it stands out. It makes my day. I remember when we got robbed and I still to this day think it was the police, a bus driver pulls up in front of <a href=\"https:\/\/weactradio.com\/\">WeAct Radio<\/a>, gets out, and comes to my door to give me 20 dollars. He tells me, \u2018I heard what happened, hope you don\u2019t close up shop, keep going.\u2019 Like, oh my God, it blew my mind. It blew my mind.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a picture, a mugshot of Martin Luther King Jr., signed by Harry Belafonte by the way, that sits in the window. Around that time, I came by the studio, and someone had kissed his picture on the glass. It\u2019s red lipstick, bold on MLK\u2019s cheek. It\u2019s random letters in the mail, you know, <a href=\"https:\/\/poets.org\/poet\/haki-madhubuti\">Haki Madhubuti<\/a> \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/thirdworldpressfoundation.org\/\">Third World Press<\/a> out of Chicago, sending me books and love, those are like Flintstone vitamins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love is like that cup of Gatorade, that cup of alkaline water when you are running a marathon at different checkpoints just to keep you going. Black love sustains us \u2013 it\u2019s the little things, it ain\u2019t the grants, it ain\u2019t sponsorship, it ain\u2019t that. It\u2019s the people that who have limited resources who try to share theirs with you. And I see that all the time. I see that all the time.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4985869\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4985869 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/04\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Love-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1221\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Alejaibara Badu, Southeast, D.C. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><b>Alejaibara Badu \u2013 Master Life Coach<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Black love is the ability to love yourself out loud, unapologetically and everything that is Black. Black love is not being afraid of your scars, your wounds. Black love is appreciating your sweetness because it comes from your Black nectar.\u00a0 Black love is loving the wideness of your nose. The fact that any time your soul is happy, your booty shakes. Embracing every aspect of what makes you. A Black love is not being ashamed of Blackness. You can\u2019t be in love with yourself and be Black and be ashamed of another Black person because it\u2019s not of Black love.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love is easy. Black love is rich. Black love takes time to drink water and rest. Black love is a dance \u2013 like \u2018I can\u2019t stop\u2019 movement. Black love is just showing up unapologetically as yourself, not being afraid of being yourself and being an advocate for yourself wherever you are. Black love is not silent. Black love is very much out loud.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love is something that I had to learn. Love is not something that was taught. Love was something that I always felt to be true. I had to learn love and Blackness, being an eighties, baby \u2013\u00a0 being dark in my melanin form. I was born in the South, so everybody wasn\u2019t happy about Blackness. Being a man and being Black also meant that I had to learn how to make myself safe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took the birth of my daughter Madison \u2013 when she was born, I was able to return back to love and love so deeply that I knew it was important to show up as an advocate for love.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a home in Africa. I\u2019m building a retreat center in Africa on the land in Osun State right by the river called The Village of Love A love is Sweet. All of that love that I\u2019m creating there, to bring folks to heal in Africa, while also looking around and seeing people still change the color of their skin because they don\u2019t understand the importance of Black love.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love is believing in regeneration because it can be a heartbreak and a transformation at the same time. I have to constantly be in a space of reincarnation. The beat has to be a muscle. The beat has to be a dance, the beat has to be strength and not a beat down. \u00a0To be unapologetically Black and in love, out loud, man\u2026 some folks are gonna look at you, baby. Some folks are going to move when you say something when you show up in a certain way, some folks are going to be so envious that you\u2019re able to do it out loud that they\u2019re going to end up being jealous instead of being Black and proud.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I see Black Love in Wards 7 and 8, it\u2019s impossible to not to see it. Black people are in Wards 7 at 8. If you don\u2019t be afraid of those that gather, you come close to those that gather, You will see how to take care of each other. I could be insecure in my head, in my mind, and go for a walk outside and come back empowered because the folks around me gave me love and wards 7 and 8. It\u2019s here, love is here. If you can\u2019t see the love here, then it\u2019s because you\u2019re in fear and fear is an opposition of love.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black love needs to be continued to be chanted in Wards 7 and 8. Folks take us for granted because they\u2019re confused on what Black love is. So more resources need to be devoted towards 7 and 8 and not resources given to organizations that\u2019s been in existence pimping in Wards 7 and 8. I feel like it\u2019s time to fund rest for Black people so they can learn to be still and heal. I feel like the outside needs to come in to love Wards 7 and 8 because Wards 7 and 8 is loving themselves because all they have is themselves. So, when is Wards 7 and 8 going to get some Black love in return?<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4985868\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4985868 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/04\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Love-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1241\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Elvera Patrick with husband Joseph Patrick in the home.

Doing anything that got to do with their family or friends or whatever it is. That\u2019s my love for her just making sure she\u2019s happy. That\u2019s the love I have for my wife. You know, other people see it differently, probably.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve been together 23 years. We\u2019ve argued, but I don\u2019t call it arguing because they only last an hour, you blink your eye \u2013 you won\u2019t even know it happened. Nobody\u2019s going to be perfect as far as love goes, it\u2019s what you feel for your partner. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s got to be giving all the time and showing her expensive things \u2013 just to be there for her when she needs you. That\u2019s the love I know.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera:<\/strong> For me, Black love is finding that right one. Sticking by him through thick and thin, no matter what.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>How has your experience been when it comes to love? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> My experience has been like living in heaven since I met her. I can\u2019t see no other love in my life. I can\u2019t see nobody outdoing her as far as my well-being is. You know, for these 23 years, I\u2019ve never really wanted for anything. I never really wish for anything. It was just always coming because she showed me that. And that\u2019s what I think love should be about.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Why is Black love important within our communities these days? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera: <\/strong>Showing Black love in our communities these days is so important because it all starts within the home. Me being a mother of four, three daughters and one son, 16 grandchildren and six great grandchildren \u2013 when they see the love that me and Joseph have, they love it. And them being around us and seeing how we act towards one another is so important to our children today. One day they\u2019re going to be adults, seeing what we have gone through and showing them a lot of love, they will know how to reach out and love their significant other.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> I also think that the younger generation going through what they\u2019re going through now, what you see, they\u2019re doing these wild things. The different disrespectful things is because they never had love shown to them in their family when they\u2019re coming up. Even when they were babies, they never had the love bestowed on them, so how can they give it out? This is a problem with our younger generation. I feel that the parents that\u2019s bringing the younger kids up, they need to show them more love and really show them love. So, do you see it\u2019s not just buy[ing] them things, but talk[ing] to them, do[ing] things with them \u2013 in that way the love, they\u2019ll know what love is. They\u2019ll think before they go out there and disrespect people\u2019s property, disrespect people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>How did you both meet and fall in love? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph<\/strong>: I met her over from a neighbor, a friend of mine. I was working with them, doing house repairs and stuff like that. We were over there playing dominoes. She and her cousin happened to come over and introduced themselves, saying that they needed a ramp built for her father that was having health problems. We started going to Home Depot, I can remember we were holding hands the first day, you know, (laughs) that was kind of strange. I guess we were both looking for love or somebody to be there for you. We just gelled instantly. It\u2019s just one of those beautiful things and we never separated. I came here to see her one night, and I just never left. We went on and we got married, we\u2019ve been here in this house 23 years with the love.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera:<\/strong> Yes, well, that\u2019s when it started.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph: \u00a0<\/strong>It brings you back to high school days, I\u2019ll never forget that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera: <\/strong>I had invited him over to the house and told him, I said, You ain\u2019t going nowhere!\u00a0(Laughs)<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>How has this 23-year journey been for you both? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> It\u2019s been educational, knowing what you can accomplish with nothing. You\u2019ve got to have a purpose. We\u2019ve had ups and downs with the family, kids and grandkids, they\u2019re having problems. You\u2019ve got to learn to stick in there and don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t deal with this.\u2019 That\u2019s what love is, when you stick with the person through thick and thin, ups or downs, that\u2019s love. I took care of her daddy, her momma, that\u2019s how much I loved her, until they passed. She was making me feel that love, so I wanted to give it back.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>How has your love influence others around you?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera:<\/strong> We have gone out together dressed in matching attire. Every time we step out, it brings a lot of love, and it makes us feel joyful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> It rewards\u2026 they\u2019re seeing and complimenting you so you must be doing something right or they wouldn\u2019t say nothing at all!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>What advice would you give people who are looking for love, especially in our communities? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> Let it come from the heart. Do something instinctively. Don\u2019t go looking for it. Don\u2019t go showing all this money, nice cars, and all that. Everybody wants a nice car. But when you\u2019re the main thing it\u2019s going to be, \u2018Is it true?\u2019 Do you really feel this or you\u2019re just doing that to get that person? Or are you willing to go out your way for that person and to share things with that person? Everything else will take care of itself. You don\u2019t go looking for the prettiest or the finest or the one making all the money or stuff like that. Just be yourself and love will find you. You ain\u2019t to find love. Love will find you, believe me. You won\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening! That\u2019s the real true love. When you meet somebody, next thing you know you\u2019re doing all these crazy things. Well, that\u2019s love to me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera:<\/strong> I 100% agree, Dear.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Is there anything else that you would like to leave us with when it comes to Black love in Wards 7 and 8?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph: <\/strong>The grass ain\u2019t always greener on the other side of that fence. Believe that once you get it, don\u2019t think something else is going to be better because they\u2019re not going to have what you are leaving. They might have something else, but they won\u2019t have what you like there. So don\u2019t look for things that it\u2019s not for you, if it doesn\u2019t natural fall on you, leave it alone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera:<\/strong> Treat him like a king. Always be respectful. Even when they are feeling down, you know, still, you got to continue to uplift.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph: <\/strong>A man have to respect his woman. All that come out to love, one big red heart.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m glad I could throw some things on this young generation. That\u2019s the biggest problem we have right now. The love for each other, not just man and woman but love for people. It\u2019s not here, back in the old days, you could feel it walking down the street, talking, speaking to your neighbors, these guns take away love. How are you going to have love and you got a gun?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Elvera: <\/strong>Back in the day, it truly was a village.\u00a0 When was the last time if you ran out of sugar, you could go next door? Can you go and get a man for a cup of sugar\u2026 they\u2019ll look at you like you crazy. But that was the love. If you see a child out there, I will take them in and say, \u2018Sit here for your mom.\u2019 With all everything that\u2019s going on, people are scared.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Joseph:<\/strong> They\u2019re doing things to these children. Terrible, I\u2019m appalled every time I look at the news it\u2019s something else that\u2019s not showing love.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4985870\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1620px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4985870 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/04\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Love-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Raji Rankins, Northeast, D.C. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Raji Rankins \u2013 Executive Director of Sewing Opportunity Never Ending (SONE)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I look at Black love like strength and power, as a simple explanation. As I go deep into what I see Black love as, I would have to say that successful Black love brings about a certain type of infinite power that develops creation \u2013 creation that has the ability for abundance, and that is healthy Black love. Now, because we have an inverse of that, I always recognize that Black love that does not have that healthiness can have the inverse effect and could have a catastrophic explosion. In both of it you see greatness because we see greatness in destruction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have had a humbling experience with Black love. I am a relationship person. I\u2019ve really been in relationships pretty much all my life. I recognize in each one of those scenarios, there\u2019s a certain part of yourself that you have to be open to share to with another person. And a lot of times that comes with struggle, something that person is struggling with. That ability to sacrifice yourself for that struggle is humbling. It teaches you love, It teaches you sacrifice, it teaches you maturity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Why do you feel as though Black love is important, especially within our communities? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black excellence is upon us, it\u2019s almost in the air, you can kind of like smell it sometimes when you\u2019re in the different cities and at the different types of events and networking. You can tell when Black excellence is around the corner. I believe that Black love is important almost as how art is important in this time of revitalization. It will help to keep our culture intact, our way of living intact, understanding of self-intact.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>Do you see a lot of Black love and wards 7 and 8?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do not smell it like how I smell Black excellence. That\u2019s a clear distinction. However, I do see it very prevalent in its early infant stages\u2026 a beautiful Black love. You see it repeatedly. It always surprises us when it\u2019s over. But if you notice, the surprise comes with the fact that you thought, \u2018Oh, I thought ya\u2019ll was [going to last] because you really had a true connection early on.\u2019 I see lots of young Black love. I see lots of new, fresh love. Old, young, middle aged, I see it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I see it as sustainable, no. It\u2019s always present in our neighborhood. I\u2019ve been engaging with 16- and 17-year old\u2019s in our summer fashion program that we\u2019ve had in partnership with UDC for ten years. I\u2019ve watched these young people as they\u2019ve developed over time, communicated, and shown a level of love in dysfunction. \u00a0I\u2019ve recognized during over COVID the last two years, that we as a community have embraced depression and anxiety to a place where there are times where our partners are going to just rely on saying \u2018It\u2019s you that\u2019s why I\u2019m feeling like this.\u2019 Being able to accept that you may be experiencing a trauma, you might be experiencing anxiety, a hormonal imbalance, takes some of the \u201cIt\u2019s You\u201d off the table.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><em>What does it take to have a successful marriage?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hard work and dedication, every day its work. That\u2019s that\u2019s the key.<\/p>\n<p>I would just say expect the hardest work that you will ever do in your life. Just expect the hardest work that you\u2019ll ever do in your life, because they\u2019ve always told us one thing \u2013 something that you don\u2019t work hard for and work<em> really<\/em> hard for is\u00a0 \u00a0not as precious as what it would be. So if\u00a0 at the end of the day, if you want your Black love to be the most precious thing, then ultimately expect for it to be some of the hardest work that you will ever do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong><em>How do you feel your marriage inspires those around you? <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like my love ultimately empowers. The way that I give love, mainly the way that I refrain from hate. Most people around me recognize that I\u2019m not a person who won\u2019t share the spotlight, that won\u2019t be a giver, because for me, ultimately power is in numbers. You know how you roll as a team, how you shine as a team. That\u2019s what really brings power.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p> &#8220;The word &#8216;Love&#8217; is most often defined as a noun, yet&#8230;we would all love better if we used it as a verb.&#8221; \u2013 bell hooks<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/23\/04\/25\/voices-black-love\/","currentSlug":"voices-black-love","created":"2023-04-25T15:08:15","modified":"2024-04-03T17:35:16","time":"Apr 25, 2023","timestamp":1682435295,"timestampGMT":1682449695,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Elvera Patrick with husband Joseph Patrick in the home.

better \u2013 time for women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last few years there has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/library\/stories\/2021\/03\/women-business-ownership-in-america-on-rise.html\">growth<\/a> in women-owned businesses across the country. Kristi Whitfield, director of the DC Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD), says the same is true in D.C.: and more and more women have been seeking small business assistance from her department.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new recognition of the talent and the ingenuity that women bring,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen see the gaps in the marketplace, and women are about creating solutions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As of 2021, women owned 47% of small businesses in D.C., according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.advocacy.sba.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/30141324\/Small-Business-Economic-Profile-DC.pdf\">U.S. Small Business Administration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Whitfield says part of what\u2019s fueling this growth is that many workplaces aren\u2019t giving women the flexibility they want. She began running her own business \u2013 D.C.\u2019s first mobile cupcake truck, Curbside Cupcakes \u2013 when she became a mom.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re the boss, having your kid there in their little carrier is not something you have to ask permission for,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>But being the boss comes with its own challenges. Women are less likely than men to have access to the credit and capital to set up and grow their businesses. And on average, businesses owned by men still earn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/resource\/blog-post\/are-women-owned-businesses-successful-male-owned-businesses#:~:text=Biz2Credit%20reports%20that%20in%202021,580%2C%20while%20men's%20was%20594.\">revenue<\/a>. \u201cThe patriarchy remains alive and well,\u201d Whitfield says.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.bankofamerica.com\/content\/dam\/newsroom\/docs\/2022\/Women%20+%20Minority%20Business%20Owner%20Spotlight%20ADA.pdf\">It\u2019s even harder<\/a> for women of color living in under-resourced communities. There is great talent east of the Anacostia River, but it needs fertile ground.<\/p>\n<p>Whitfield says her department has worked to level the playing field. There\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcsbdc.org\/dream-grants-for-ward-7-8-micro-businesses\/\">Dream Grant<\/a> program, for example, that awards up to $10,000 to business owners in Wards 7 and 8. DSLBD also set up a crowdfunding loan program with nonprofit microlender Kiva, which helps small business owners build credit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe people in [Wards] 7 and 8 are amazing and strong and smart, and are doing really cool and innovative things,\u201d Whitfield says.<\/p>\n<p>There are women driving the local fashion scene, women opening bookstores. There are women opening hair and nail salons, women in manufacturing.<\/p>\n<p>Ramunda Young, the co-owner of Mahogany Books, says when you\u2019re a Black woman and starting your business, you find yourself entering rooms where you aren\u2019t heard.<\/p>\n<p>Now, she says she gets to choose which rooms to enter, and which to stay in.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy out here as a woman. People second guess your intelligence. They second guess your integrity,\u201d Young says. \u201cWe always have to show up in a room and be bigger and badder, so to speak, or bolder, just for somebody to recognize our value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jheri Taylor, who founded nail salon She Nail\u2019d It, says it\u2019s not easy to access capital, and that getting grants can be a lot more complicated. But Taylor says she and other Black women have the skills, and each other.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do see a lot of women welcoming and banding together,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This women\u2019s history month, DCist\/WAMU heard the stories of five business owners: how they got to where they are, the challenges they\u2019ve overcome and continue to face, the support they need, and what inspires them.<\/p>\n<p><em>Their responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982972\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982972 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Women-Business-Owners-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1123\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Ramunda Young, co-owner of MahoganyBooks, at the store\u2019s Anacostia location. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Ramunda Young \u2013 co-owner, MahoganyBooks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What made you set up shop in Ward 8?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were looking at literacy stats, and the literacy stats are kind of crazy over here. And it may be for a lot of different reasons\u2026access to printed materials is a huge thing. And so not having a bookstore in this community for over 20 years really spoke to us. We were out looking at this spot in Virginia, but [we thought] what about over here, what about home \u2013 and I say home from my husband\u2019s perspective, he was was born and raised in D.C.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why not be here? Our people are here, our community is here, Black people are here. And so we felt like it checked all the boxes to be in this space.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>You could have set up any kind of shop, why books?\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ever since I was a little kid, I loved reading, but I did not have access to Black books until I got to college. I went to a HBCU in Oklahoma called Langston University, and so when I started reading Black books, my life just changed. I felt like ya\u2019ll couldn\u2019t talk to me! I know so much more about who I am now. One of the books that really impacted me was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mahoganybooks.com\/9780924944031\">Nile Valley Civilization<\/a> by Dr. Tony Browder. It was just mind boggling for me to read the contributions that\u00a0Black people, that African people, have contributed to this world. So that\u2019s my perspective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then my husband\u2019s perspective \u2013 he was raised in D.C. His mom took him to bookstores all the time in D.C. I\u2019m from Oklahoma, so it was a totally different. His experience was reading Black books. We had two voracious readers coming from two different perspectives and we both have a commitment to community; we both have a commitment to culture. Books was this kind of crossroads that met us both. We used to go on dates in bookstores before we even talked about wanting to do this. I mean, we\u2019d sit in bookstores for hours and just sit and read. And so, when we tossed around ideas of what we want to do as far as a business, books was an easy one for us.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the extensive impact Black books had on him growing up and then me from college, it just made sense to delve into that micro niche [Black books] and not just be a general bookstore. We could have been a \u2018Black and Noble\u2019, so to speak, but we said, \u2018No, we want to dip all the way down into Black books.\u2019 I worked at one of the biggest bookstore chains in the world and what I saw was Black books being removed from the shelves. The inventory was getting smaller and smaller.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest thing was why would we let somebody else be in control of our narrative? If they don\u2019t think our books are important on their shelves, why would we leave it up to them to say it\u2019s not worth it? So for us, we said we don\u2019t want to be in that position. So,opening our own bookstore was saying we want to take this into our own hands.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What are some of the challenges of being a business owner, as a Black woman?\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Going to get financing. There were so many questions. Yes, I get you\u2019re supposed to be questioned to find out the financial viability of a business. I get that. But we\u2019re giving you all the proof! We\u2019re showing you that books are billion dollar business, and to still get turned down and have them say, \u2018No, you\u2019re competing with another big online behemoth,\u2019 and not really understand our business. That\u2019s the Black cloak that I say that I have to wear \u2013 I wear it all day and I\u2019m proudly Black \u2013 but then to add the woman layer on it, not having your voice heard in rooms, I would walk into rooms and people kind of looked at me like, \u2018Okay, why are you here?\u2019<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why shouldn\u2019t I be at this table? Always being second guessed when I was at the table was hard as a woman. It was just crazy to me. I think that\u2019s a hurdle that women always have. We always have to show up in a room and be bigger and badder so to speak \u2013 or bolder \u2013 just for somebody to recognize our value. So that is a thread that has continued. I get into rooms a little bit easier now, but I now choose the rooms.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s crazy out here as a woman, people second guess your intelligence. They second guess your integrity. But if a man or white person walks into a room, they automatically are steps above, as far as credibility and viability. And that\u2019s just from many, many, many centuries of intrinsic racism \u2013 how people see us, how they think we\u2019re not smart enough, and that\u2019s not the case for us. But oh, well, we\u2019re here now, 16 years and counting!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982973\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1645px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982973 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Women-Business-Owners-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1645\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jerri Evans, owner of Turning Natural juice bar at her Capitol Hill location. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Jerri Evans \u2013 owner, Turning Natural<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>How long have you been in business and how did you get your start? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It will be 10 years in December, and I\u2019ve been juicing now for over 25 years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It essentially started with my mom. My mom started juicing because she was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in 2001 \u2013 and juicing wasn\u2019t a fun thing for us; she had her Jack LaLanne juicer and they made a whole bunch of noise. She was juicing for health, because during her remission of stage two breast cancer, she couldn\u2019t eat anything, she was very nauseated all the time. Juicing was a big part of her, one, getting nutrients in, and two, having something in her body that could help her as she goes throughout the day taking chemotherapy and radiation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">When my mother passed away, at the time I was still an aeronautical engineer. I had no concept of,\u2019I\u2019m about to start a business.\u2019 I quit my job maybe seven months after my mother passed and everyone was like, \u2018Are you freaking crazy? What are you doing?\u2019\u00a0 I just wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t mentally there. I wasn\u2019t in a place where I wanted to continue to do work in that way. I was living in Atlanta, and decided I wanted to come home.\u00a0 I knew that I wanted to do something centered around health, but I wanted it to be fun. I wanted it to be something that people could do every day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I came up with the concept, okay, maybe I can open a juice bar. But mind you, I left D.C. at 17. I\u2019d never paid bills in this city, so I never truly understood how expensive it was to live here, let alone open a business. The first spot that I looked at, two Ethiopian brothers owned it, and they wanted $7,000 a month. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry?\u2019\u00a0 And you don\u2019t know at the time what a triple net lease is. You don\u2019t know at the time that you have to have a million dollars in in general liability insurance. You don\u2019t know that you must have all of these different things. So, it\u2019s not just $7,000 a month, you have an electric bill, you have a gas bill, you have all these other things. I was like \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m gonna stay in my kitchen.;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">But then I realized, as we were growing so fast, I have to have a space. My godfather had a church that had like a 350 square foot space, and we turned that into technically our first juice bar. And it\u2019s been up since then!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>How has it been being a Black women in business? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let\u2019s start with the beauty: I have had an indescribable amount of support from people, and there\u2019s something about Black people\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of things magical about Black people. But when it comes to that support and how we stick up for each other, how we really truly ride for each other\u2026 I came into this thinking, Oh, I\u2019m just going to have one juice bar. And, you know, a lot of the customers came from the church. A lot of customers came from people that my mom knew and that I knew. But then when I started to see faces that I just did not know, they would come in and just order juices or order smoothies. I was like, \u2018What\u2019s happening? Like, this is a real business?\u2019<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about it: We have Black people who want to be a part of something, whether it\u2019s on the customer side, whether it\u2019s on the vendor side, whether it\u2019s on the staffing side. Like it\u2019s really a conglomerate. You literally see nothing but Black faces. We do have customers who are not Black, but it\u2019s just something about watching us come in and support and rally and creating something that is specifically Black identifying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think people are afraid to talk about the success part. Like, this business has afforded me a life that I probably would not have lived. Yeah, I was aeronautical engineer and I made money, but we\u2019re scared to talk about that. I get to travel, and I get to go to a grocery store and not worry about how expensive eggs are because they\u2019re expensive right now.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, for balance, it has to come with the ugly side. And it\u2019s you just don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. There\u2019s not enough conversation around the things that you don\u2019t know that you should know. Either you learned them through hitting a brick wall or experiencing hardship, or you\u2019re like lucky enough to find somebody to say, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s how I did it and this is the way that it should go.\u2019<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>Which Black women inspire you? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oh, there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s so many in in so many different genres of life. I\u2019m an avid reader, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, Octavia Butler, bell hooks are some of my favorites. What I love about them is how they write about Black women. I can see myself in their writings. I can identify with how they speak. I identify with how they describe how I look.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I am forever inspired by my mother. I think that I\u2019m learning more about her in death that I have in the 24 years that I had with her. She had desires, she had goals, and she had dreams. You [often] don\u2019t look at your parents that way, specifically your mother.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Why did you choose to set up shop in Anacostia?<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m from Anacostia. We started talking to a few people and they were like, \u2018You know, Virginia would be great.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, what?\u2019\u00a0 This is not to say that people in Virginia do not have access to healthy food options, but I have a personal responsibility. I told my team we\u2019re going to Southeast. I drove them around \u2013 I saw for lease sign, and I was like, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m peeking in, then I see two eyes looking back at me. They came to the door, and we started talking. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was scared. We just got this first location, it\u2019s up and running, I won\u2019t say it\u2019s running smoothly but it\u2019s running. The audacity, I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m about to do another location \u2013 financially, how does that work?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">We made it work. So that was one of my main reasons of coming into Southeast, because we deserve good things. We talk about gentrification often and my biggest issue with gentrification is displacement. We\u2019re not included in these plans. I wanted something that replicated what is traditionally white, right? Traditionally it is not something that our culture is involved in. And like that first day and first weeks I was like, \u2018Oh my God, where are you people coming from and why do they want this?\u2019 Like, you\u2019re literally sitting back and you\u2019re having this imposter syndrome. I wanted to make sure that I included a community that grew with me to give back to.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What advice would you give Black women looking to open a business? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">People think that they have to have something perfect to present. Start where you are with what you have, then you can make it better later. We were writing labels on bottles with Sharpie pens. I didn\u2019t have labels.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultivate a community of people, not just entrepreneurs. Like there\u2019s a community of people that I have never personally met but know my name and support my company and I can never truly put into words what that means to me. I hope the words \u2018Thank you\u2019 never become redundant \u2013\u00a0 I tend to say thank you a lot to people because it still surprises me that people wake up and choose Turning Natural.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982971\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1631px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982971 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Women-Business-Owners-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1631\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jheri Taylor, owner of She Nail\u2019d It, in her suite located at Black and Forth. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Jheri Taylor \u2013 owner, She Nail\u2019d it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What inspired you to start your own business? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">This March makes the 6th year that I\u2019ve been an entrepreneur. It fell into my lap\u2026no \u2013 I was more so forced into it. I\u2019ve been fired from every job I\u2019ve ever had, getting 15 or 16\u00a0W2\u2019s a year. I knew that the work force wasn\u2019t for me. I feel like I\u2019m a Type A personality. I dislike things that aren\u2019t done a certain way, I like them structured. I use my voice to speak up if things aren\u2019t right and if I feel things can be done a more efficient way. I don\u2019t mind speaking up. So sometimes, that\u2019s shunned upon, especially being a Black woman in a majority caucasian setting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I got fired like a week, a week and a half after I did everything for \u201cShe Nailed It\u201d. I think it was destiny. God will push you and make you so uncomfortable if you\u2019re not operating in the world that he has for you. I definitely feel like that\u2019s what happened for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">That first year was rocky. The first three months were crazy: my wife had gotten locked up, incarcerated, and from there literally everything was on me. I was going to school\u2026.she got locked up while I was in class. So, when I graduated I had to take the savings and go get some supplies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I started out mobile \u2013 initially I was thinking to myself, \u2018What can I do to be different?\u2019 One, I didn\u2019t know there were so many sisters in the nail tech industry. I did not know that. But we\u2019re all tucked away in our homes operating that way. I was trying to figure out a way that I could separate myself from the masses. Clientele was was slow, super slow, but I would still promote. I\u2019d put fliers on people\u2019s cars. \u00a0Instagram was a thing and so was other social media, but not like how it is set up now for content.\u00a0 My clientele grew from word of mouth.<\/p>\n<p>It was a journey. When my wife came home, I wasn\u2019t making any money, so we were $10,000 behind in rent. And [it was] like, one of the scariest times of my life. And this is the first year \u2013 so hectic for her to come home to. Good thing for her savings! But things turned around, which I\u2019m super grateful for. Clientele grew, my skill set grew, which is then what made people start wanting to get services done by me. And again, this has been a journey.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What have some of\u00a0 the challenges been, and also some of the glow? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the challenges have been pushing through when we don\u2019t feel like it. You don\u2019t feel encouraged. That\u2019s been a challenge because especially through the pandemic, or even before that. When I didn\u2019t have a clientele set I still got up and made a post or did advertising on foot or whatever. It was pushing through to get success.\u00a0 The challenges are internal, definitely, because you don\u2019t have anybody to motivate you \u2013\u00a0 as far as the structure from the corporate world where you have a boss that\u2019s telling you, \u2018Hey, this needs to be done, this needs to be turned and you have a deadline.\u2019\u00a0 You don\u2019t have that on the entrepreneurial side. So just being my own driving force, if\u00a0 you will.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sometimes I feel like some girls like to tussle in the beauty industry, just from my experiences. I think collaborating sometimes is a little bit hectic, it\u2019s not really welcomed and fostered. It\u2019s taught me, maybe everyone\u2019s not for you or that\u2019s just not your tribe. It hasn\u2019t been super welcoming for me across the nail tech industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The good things are I\u2019ve made connections with a lot of entrepreneurial women in <em>other<\/em> fields that have taught me so much. They haven\u2019t been gatekeepers. Whatever it is they struggle with, they are pretty much the blueprint so that you don\u2019t have to make those same mistakes \u2013 you know how to navigate it should it come about. I\u2019ve gotten to connect with some amazing women.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being able to be creative in my own way has created such a freedom in thinking and my mind. Overall it\u2019s changed my perception, I used to think \u2018my way or the highway\u2019, now <strong>I\u2019m<\/strong> open to different perspectives on things.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How do you feel you can be supported more as a Black woman owned business?\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Access to capital or easier access to capital. Making the [grant application] process easier.\u00a0 You would need to hire a professional or know someone to get through it. It\u2019s enough to actually discourage someone. I know that the funds are there, why is it so difficult to get them to people?<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">But sometimes we\u2019re in our own way, too. For me it was not having any overhead, I didn\u2019t have to pay anyone else except for me. Sometimes that can keep us in a place of comfort and not even wanting to reach out and see what opportunities are out there for us, also.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I do see a lot of women welcoming and banding together. We\u2019re definitely repping, representing each other well and putting each other on for more opportunities. We\u2019re aware of our work and I\u2019m proud of us. Yes, ladies, I\u2019m proud of us, 7 and 8 Wards!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982970\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1534px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982970 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Women-Business-Owners-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1534\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Shannon Evans, owner of Natural Kinks hair salon. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Shannon Evans \u2013 owner, Natural Kinks\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>What\u2019s your experience been like as a business owner?\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ve had Natural Kinks for 20 years. We specialize in natural hair and natural haircare. It\u2019s been good. It has its ups and downs. This is is my third location due to the gentrifying of the neighborhood. I have lost two salons to developers. They sold the building and didn\u2019t renew my lease. Hopefully this person won\u2019t sell and I\u2019ll be good. Just staying in this area right here on Capitol Hill has been hard. It\u2019s like you get a space, you just pray that you can renew your lease when your lease is up and they didn\u2019t decide to sell. So that\u2019s the only thing. But I love doing hair, been doing it for over 20 years I\u2019ve had a business for 20 years. Having a lot of clients that\u2019s been supportive, continue to repeat and come back, [is why] I\u2019m still here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong><em>\u00a0What made you get into this business?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ve always been into the hair. As a little girl, I started out braiding hair. Then I stopped braiding hair because I decided to go natural. I started working at a natural hair salon to get educated on natural hair.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What are the challenges you\u2019re faced with and how can you be supported more? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s hard to even get a stylist. It\u2019s hard to find a space that you can afford. It\u2019s hard to find the grants and things that can help you out with it. Unless you know somebody, who knows somebody, who knows somebody. Other than that, a lot of young ladies are going and getting suites. That\u2019s been the big thing now \u2013 they finish [school], they get they get their license, and they go and do their own thing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everybody wants to work for themself in this industry now, they don\u2019t want to work for nobody or be in someone else\u2019s space. [They] do their own marketing on social media and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s hard getting people. To get more staff, to get more young ladies who\u2019s willing and want to learn. I have the clientele support. I just don\u2019t have the staff support. They\u2019ll come long enough to build the clientele and then they want to leave.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What would like to say, about being a Black woman in business in D.C.?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Work hard and abide by the rules and regulations, make your customers happy and they\u2019ll keep coming back. Hold on to your customers and your staff.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I like decorating, I decorated all the shops. I like to make them (customers) feel comfortable, where you can come in the place and feel like you\u2019re not in a salon. I want you to feel at home, I want you to feel welcome, like family. I try to have a warm environment for the customers to walk in here and still work like they are working from home. I have two or three of them out there. They always pop the computer open or are on a meeting or whatever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What is your \u2018why\u2019? What keeps you going? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s a passion. I love doing natural hair. I love making people look good, feel good, be able to sit in my chair and let their hair down. They might want to share something that\u2019s going on in their life.\u00a0 The good things, bad things, all the way around. I get it all, I just listen, you know? I\u2019m there for them like a therapist, but not a therapist. When they say stylists\u00a0 are therapists, [they mean] we hear it all. I just have to learn not hold on to what people are going through.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982974\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982974 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Dee-Dwyer_Voices_Black-Women-Business-Owners.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1227\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jenelle Henderson, owner of Dressed to Manifest at Vintage and Charmed Classic Clothing. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Jenelle Henderson \u2013 owner, Dressed to Manifest\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tells us about your business and the role that it plays in the community.\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>My business is called Dress to Manifest, and it is a style and image consulting business that utilizes sustainable fashion to make women feel beautiful and align their wardrobes with what they want manifested. I then partner with vendors, vintage stores, sustainable fashion brands, and handmade brands to create looks for my clients. Everything we do is only sustainable fashion.<\/p>\n<p>I believe everything we need has already been created and I don\u2019t want to be a contributor to waste. I believe we\u2019re put here to be good managers and stewards of what we already have. While I love clothes, I hate the idea of fast fashion and retail waste and Back people being the largest consumers of anything, but [especially] of retail.<\/p>\n<p>We are also the largest consumers of waste, but we don\u2019t profit off of our waste because we then give our things back to white owned organizations for them to profit again off of us. Goodwill is a multibillion-dollar brand. My business and my model are to provide an alternative for our community that actually goes back to our community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>What are the challenges you\u2019re faced with?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being in Southeast, I had no idea it had such a stigma. I\u2019m from Atlanta originally, but I love Southeast. I also love us and we are here, Black people are in Southeast. Black people who have businesses and own homes are in Southeast. I\u2019m from Atlanta, where there\u2019s a large percentage of Black people doing well. That\u2019s how I grew up. I want to be surrounded around brown and Black people doing well. But people are really scared of Southeast.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019ve had some comments they\u2019ve been made, especially since I\u2019m back in the area, that I\u2019ve really have felt like, well, don\u2019t bring yourself over here because we don\u2019t want your business anyway. There\u2019s a little self-hate going on. I think that one of the challenges is that there seems to be a stigma about this area that extends beyond the community into Black people and even into the politics here, that disgusts me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I just believe that if we don\u2019t pour into this community, this community is going to be taken from us like other communities have been. If we don\u2019t see the power and the love and the beauty in Southeast, then we\u2019re not going to have it. And that\u2019s going to be very sad because I see so much of D.C. having already been lost to people who don\u2019t give a \u2018F\u2019 about our communities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think the biggest challenge is to break that stigma up. I\u2019m bout to bring all of my gifts to Southeast because I think it\u2019s important that Black people do well here and that we shine a light into this community, because I hate some of the growing pains that I\u2019ve experienced just from being over here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s a lot of \u00a0jewels over here and it\u2019s a lot of community over here. I have felt more community living in Anacostia than I have anywhere in D.C. and I\u2019ve been all over this city. I feel safe walking up and down the street. People speak. People are taking pictures of me. People are putting me on to stuff. There is love in this community, and I just want to be one of the people who shine the light on the love that is here.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>How did you get involved in fashion?\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Me putting together looks was an outlet, and everybody started knowing me as the fashion girl, like in school and law school. Once \u2013 I was an attorney \u2013\u00a0 my judge called me the fashion princess. At some point I realized because I was getting stopped so much, getting asked about where I was shopping, I realized it could be a business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was getting my legal career kind of stripped from me that made me say, \u2018O.K. God, what do you want me to do?\u2019 And I heard him say, \u2018Make women beautiful.\u2019 I\u2019ve been in this thing since. I got business cards made the next day and got clients the same month, just dressing people. I had to learn some business \u2013 but the fashion thing\u2026 You know, clothes are a manifestation tool. That\u2019s why I refuse to walk away from them at this point, because I know the power and the energy they possess, especially when you talk about secondhand clothing. You can make some shit shake, some rooms move, some doors open off the energy of clothes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">So that\u2019s why I love them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in fashion. That\u2019s why we have this store, because I just want to pour into women. And I know how much I can do now. I can only give so much of myself. But I do know I have a gift of of manifestation through wardrobe, and so if I can share that gift and teach some people about just the power of what clothing can do\u2026Yeah, we\u2019re going to be in fashion for a while.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em><strong>How could you be supported more?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m one of those people, I\u2019m not asking for a handout. Although I would say I have a pretty affluent clientele, I have people in my circle who are well taken care of. I don\u2019t want an investment that is not genuine and not in alignment to what my purpose is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I do find it hard to tap into funding, particularly because I service women and because I\u2019m not in tech and because how I move is not traditional. What I do is so spiritual. It ain\u2019t a lot of money for spiritual businesses, I\u2019m just putting it out there! So either you\u2019re going to have to figure out how you get it for yourself, or you\u2019re going to have to trade in some of your your business to really kind of fit into the mold of what they want to give money to.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I need a space at this point. How I get a space, whether it\u2019s through money, someone gifting me, I just need a bigger space than what I\u2019m in now. I need a warehouse. We need to be able to donate back to a Black owned thrift store. We\u2019re in a Black owned community, we need to be able to donate back. I need to work like a Goodwill or Salvation Army\u00a0 \u2013 on a larger scale \u2013 which means that I need people in place who understand the business model and a lot of people don\u2019t. This business model is not sexy because it\u2019s used clothes, but baby, Goodwill is a multi-billion dollar business with a B and their CEO makes multi-million dollars as a salary. I\u2019m just trying to tell you that the average thrift store is not a mom and pop it\u2019s bringing in $100,000 a day. If we want to talk about building Black wealth, then we need to learn how to recycle wealth and recycle our goods.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Black girls, we\u2019re here to unite, fly girls we\u2019re here to unite. I\u2019m trying to give to as many Black women businesses as possible. It\u2019s enough of us who make beautiful things, who have beautiful gifts, and we\u2019re just not being seen, so come over here and let me get you dressed so you could be seen on the scene. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. I\u2019m just here to give you my gifts so that you can act in yours.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a Black woman and you\u2019ve got a business and you\u2019re still in the game, or you\u2019re still trying to figure it out \u2013 I just love you for being a Black woman, because it\u2019s a lot for us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:

Too often, residents have needed to find creative ways to keep businesses and art programs alive amid underinvestment from the city and potential developers. But what could the majority-Black neighborhood in Ward 8 achieve with more funding?<\/p>\n<p>Kristina Noell was appointed executive director of the Anacostia Business Improvement District (BID) in 2018, and she began asking this very question while meeting with local Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, the BID\u2019s arts council, and more than 110 local business owners she says she visited.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing she says people wanted to amplify: Anacostia\u2019s arts and culture scene. The neighborhood is already well-known as an official historic district, but Noell and other local leaders wanted official recognition of the area\u2019s creativity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to be a world class area, just like the rest of the city,\u201d Noell says. \u201cAnd we want to be able to showcase what we have and what is so special about where we are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So, last July, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development\u00a0(DMPED) awarded $3,780,000 to the Anacostia BID to formally establish the Anacostia Arts and Culture District. Noell says she asked for \u201ca lot more money than that\u201d and that it\u2019s an American Rescue Plan Act grant, meaning there are restrictions on how the funds can be spent over a five-year period.<\/p>\n<p>This grant is just the first step \u2014 it\u2019s a transformative placemaking grant that can be used to add murals, signage, lighting, outdoor furniture, and greenery to welcome visitors and highlight already existing programs like Art to Go Go and the Anacostia Jazz Hop, Noell says. With an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=41nEwdYtbIA\">unveiling ceremony<\/a> last week, Mayor Muriel Bowser solidified the designation and <a href=\"https:\/\/dc.gov\/release\/mayor-bowser-unveils-anacostia-arts-and-culture-district\">promised<\/a> an additional $202,000 to create public art in Ward 8 through DMPED and the MuralsDC program.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about what the community wants, DCist\/WAMU spoke with Ward 8 artists about what art means to them and, specifically, what they hope to see in an official Anacostia Arts and Culture District.<\/p>\n<p><em>Their responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.<\/em><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4979820\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1523px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4979820 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_DCist_Art-District_-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1523\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Artist Chris Pyrate. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Chris Pyrate \u2013 Artist\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Art means to me, a vision that someone has in their head that they can only see. Something that doesn\u2019t exist, yet that they can make other people see. That\u2019s what art is, the process of making people see what\u2019s in your mind.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>We<\/strong> <strong>have a new arts district coming here to Ward 8. How do you feel about that? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it\u2019s about time. I always tell people a big inspiration to me about what I do is, if I had seen people like me, early on, I probably would have got to my destiny or purpose way faster instead of going through a bunch of different trials and tribulations, you know, growing pains. And especially coming from around there \u2013 there\u2019s a very limited scope, at least when when I was growing up, of people you see like you and what they\u2019re able to do with their life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think art is just so unlimited in general. It makes even other things possible to you, even outside of art. When I was a kid, I wanted to make video games \u2013 that\u2019s through art. I feel like from video games, to designing cars, to whatever you see, art means unlimited imagination.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What<\/strong> <strong>type of support would you say is needed for the arts district to be a thriving arts district, for it to be successful?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think its twofold, I think you need funding, but funding isn\u2019t always the answer because you need direction with that funding. You need different generations of artists to help lead it. We have different timelines of how you can make it, it\u2019s not a linear career path. How people made it 40 years ago is still relevant in a gallery type of way. [But] you need young artists to represent the ever-changing ways that\u2019s coming. I don\u2019t think funding works without artists\u2019 representation because you get a lot of people who represent wards and cities and can spend budgets, but they\u2019ve never experienced art or making art. They don\u2019t know what it takes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>How do you envision this arts district? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think we need loud walls, colors, because everybody passes them and drives, passses [through] that [area] all the time. \u00a0I think it just creates an atmosphere. You look at a place like Wynwood in Miami, there\u2019s no place like that. We have that talent here and we have the walls for sure. There\u2019s a lot of brick, and instead of just leaving things the natural color, why not expose people\u2019s imagination? I think that\u2019s a great environment for kids to grow up in specifically. Because kids gravitate towards that stuff\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 especially over there,(Ward 8) kids have got to grow up quick. Just having that type of art everywhere \u2013 I\u2019m speaking of murals specifically. I see that immediately.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think art installations too, they do that in Miami, L.A., a little bit in New York. Statues, things like that. They rotate, it\u2019s not just a historic statue, but something creative. Something interactive too, where people can use it but it\u2019s also art at the same time. I just see interactive from walls to installations.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I just think this is mad important. Having proper representation of people from the area, specifically Ward 8, Anacostia, around that area \u2013 get those artists involved too, so it doesn\u2019t get out of hand. Some of this stuff loses identity in the process, and I think we can\u2019t allow that.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4979821\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1418px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4979821 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_DCist_Art-District_-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1418\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Keyonna Jones \u2013 Artist, and Executive Director of Congress Heights Arts and Culture Center. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Keyonna Jones \u2013 Artist, Executive Director of Congress Heights Arts &amp; Culture Center<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0We are an art gallery, first and foremost. We provide programs and workshops. We also serve as a rental space for the community. But we have a mission to expose, inspire, educate and heal our community, all through art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about, and what do you envision a new arts district in Ward 8 to be like?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I\u2019m very excited about the opportunity that\u2019s coming east of the river. I think there\u2019s a lot of development and things happening, but my lane specifically is about art and how we can use art to make our communities better. And so that much money that\u2019s dedicated to specifically what I do and love every day is very exciting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">What will it look like? It will look busy. It will look colorful. Plenty of murals, plenty of gallery shops that can [be] just next door to each other \u2013 you can walk down a strip full of art. I think it\u2019ll be a space where artists will want to come from all over the city, not just from east of the river. I think it will help us thrive as a community. More traffic, more business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think it\u2019s important to have a space and multiple spaces that all types of artists can visit and benefit from. I think we have a lot of galleries and traditional places for visual arts, but it\u2019d be exciting to see some more diverse places for music or dance, just touching every avenue of art. I think that\u2019s important and it\u2019s cool to see on our side, things that you\u2019ve never seen before that you could go see downtown in the Smithsonian \u2013 high caliber art.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What do you feel is needed? What type of additional support does Ward 8 need to have a thriving arts district?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think one thing that most people need to know, or most people start to learn about the businesses east of the river \u2013 in, our community, is that we need technical support. There\u2019s a lot of us that are doing it from passion,\u00a0 and we\u2019re one woman or one-man bands just trying to handle a lot of work. So, I think not only just creating spaces for us to be in, but having that back end support, whether it be accountants, CPA\u2019s, grant writers, anything that could help the other businesses that are already here scale and expand I think would be helpful.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4979819\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4979819 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_DCist_Art-District_-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1213\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Dionne McDonald -Curator at Honfleur Gallery. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Dionne McDonald \u2013 Curator, Honfleur Gallery\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">Art is a lens in to worlds, known and unknown. It is shapeless and cannot be contained. Art challenges your beliefs and reshapes our perspectives. \u00a0It is softness a cove or haven. Art is mostly visual but reaches all of our senses. Sometimes art is a life raft. As a new arts district establishes itself in Ward 8, I\u2019d like to see the richness of the culture that already exists here be amplified.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What type of additional support do you feel Ward 8 needs to be a thriving arts district?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">More visibility, accessibility and more unbiased support. The funding of projects that are impactful and meaningful to this community. Making sure the commitment to authenticity is maintained.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4979822\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1517px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4979822 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_DCist_Art-District_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1517\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Dietrich Williams, Co-Founder of Capitol Hills Boys Club at The Laundromat. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Dietrich Williams \u2013 Co-Founder, Capitol Hills Boys Club at \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The artists\u2019 residency is something that was created out of a need. We \u2013 Marc Garrett, my business partner \u2013 have been working in the arts as muralists\u00a0and created a program of the things <em>we<\/em> need and saw that \u2018oh, <em>everybody<\/em> needs this stuff\u2019.\u00a0 Being muralists in Wards 7 and 8 and Ward 6 as well has shown us over the past two years \u2013 we keep meeting photographers, we keep meeting poets, we keep meeting rappers, we keep being producers. But everybody we meet is from over here (Ward 8), we keep meeting them in different spaces, but everybody\u2019s from over here (Ward 8).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about Ward 8 having an arts district?\u00a0 How do you envision it?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be supportive of artists and art serving organizations, to be collegial in their approach in their 5,10, 15 year plan. The largest arts area in D.C. really is is in Wards 7 and 8. I envision them just being collaborative with the artists and artists\u2019 organizations so we can help shape whatever this is going to be like for everybody. And it\u2019s not just like something that\u2019s [going to] come here and [be] imposed on us and saying, this is going to be like this and this is going to be this way, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What type support does the arts district need to provide?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">The arts district needs open space for artists to be inclusive in whatever it is that they plan on rolling out. It\u2019s going to need a space where artists can go and create things in a drop-in capacity. We need that because artists on this side of town, we can\u2019t afford to rent buildings and to have studio galleries. With the cost of living and the real estate, it\u2019s just not an option to do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">And one of the things we want is to be able to leverage some equity for artists so they can just be artists \u2013 whatever that looks like for them. Give them assistance, don\u2019t tell them how to be artists. You know, there\u2019s a lot of spaces that can tell you how to be artists, but what they\u2019re not doing is helping you with <em>being<\/em> artists, and with removing some of the barriers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">You may need to have an exhibit on how to go out there and begin working. Maybe you need supplies, maybe you need a place to show, maybe you need a website, maybe you need marketing and people need to know who you are. Maybe you need the business aspect of it \u2013 like being a sole proprietor and have an LLC and being registered with all the necessary agencies so you can be an artist.<\/p>\n<p>Just try to be as inclusive as possible.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4979816\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1534px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4979816 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_DCist_Art-District_-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1534\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Marc Garrett, Artist and Co-Founder Co-Founder of Capitol Hills Boys Club at The Laundromat. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Marc Garrett \u2013 Artist, Co-Founder of Capitol Hills Boys Club at \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">[Art] is a form of expression. It\u2019s an expressive interpretation that people can connect with.\u00a0I\u2019m a practicing artist and I\u2019ve been a professional artist since 2012.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about the new arts district and what do you envision for that?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I feel like D.C.\u2019s culture oftentimes has come from its poor, more so than its affluent. If I were to do anything, I would start here, too. But on a more enlightened note, the cheapest real estate is here. So that\u2019s the real reason why it\u2019s going to start here if it can happen, because there\u2019s a lot of open development that needs to take place and it can happen a lot faster with an underdeveloped area where impoverished people are given checks to give up their property, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What do you envision for for the new arts district?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">If I had a stronger connection to the construction and developmental process, the banks that reside in the city and the philanthropists, I would try to seek out the best ones. The ones that have a good rapport. Ones that have proven themselves to make equity wherever they\u2019ve gone. And if they\u2019re going to come here, I would like to see that happen versus any of the macro developers that just want to come here because they see stuff moving around over here and they want to pad their resumes with good intentions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>What type of support do you feel Ward 8 needs to thrive in the arts district? And what type of support do you need to have a thriving artists\u2019 residency specifically? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">I am a muralist and a commercial artist, so the bulk of my support has been in the form of supplies and grants. I think that<a href=\"https:\/\/humanitiesdc.org\/\">\u00a0D.C. Humanities<\/a> is trying to work on the connectivity to its artists that want to apply. I think that there is a lot of application discrepancies that get in the way of a lot of artists\u2019 funding that they can have access to. So, what I would hope to provide is a bridge over top of that so that people can get to the money that they deserve and have access to a lot of the things that other operating artists have.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\">With everything on the rise, I hope \u2018rising tides raises all ships\u2019 and I hope we can connect with some of the developers to ensure that whatever it is that they have in mind is overseen by the right people, whether it be us or other like-minded organizations.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;ll be a space where artists will want to come from all over the city, not just from east of the river.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
