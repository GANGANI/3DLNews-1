Council <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/24\/02\/06\/dc-council-vote-crime-bill-secure-dc\/\">cast its first of two votes<\/a> on an omnibus public safety bill with about 100 provisions. The bill, called \u201cSecure DC,\u201d is a combination of provisions from a dozen different crime bills the council has previously considered, with some new ones tacked on. Secure DC is currently scheduled for a second vote before the D.C. Council on March 5, where councilmembers are likely to propose additional amendments before ultimately passing it and sending it on to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for her approval.<\/p>\n<p>Because the bill is so long \u2014 and because it tackles a variety of policy issues ranging from gun penalties to food quality at the D.C. Jail \u2014 you\u2019d be forgiven if you were somewhat confused about its contents. So we solicited your Secure DC questions, and put the most frequently asked ones (along with their answers) together in one place for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a question we didn\u2019t answer here, email me at <a href=\"mailto:jgathrig@wamu.org\">jgathrig@wamu.org<\/a> and we\u2019ll consider adding your question to this post in an update!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Secure DC? Can you give a quick overview of the bill?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This bill has 100 provisions, so there would be nothing quick about an overview. But here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of what the bill does, just to show how wide-ranging it is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ups the penalties for certain gun possession offenses, and creates new gun offenses like \u201cendangerment with a firearm,\u201d which criminalizes firing a gun in public<\/li>\n<li>Broadens the definition of carjacking to include cases where a person might be a bit farther away from a person\u2019s car, responding to concerns from prosecutors that the current definition of carjacking is being narrowly interpreted by the courts<\/li>\n<li>Requires several public safety-related government agencies to share more data about the outcomes of diversion programs, 911 errors, pretrial supervision, and more, either with the public or the Mayor and D.C. Council<\/li>\n<li>Amends or relaxes certain police reforms passed by the D.C. Council in recent years, including vehicular pursuit and neck restraint policies<\/li>\n<li>Expands a rebate program for residents who purchase private security cameras for their homes<\/li>\n<li>Tilts the law to favor more pretrial detention for adults and children accused of crimes categorized as violent or dangerous<\/li>\n<li>Creates a felony charge for strangulation<\/li>\n<li>Raises the age of child victims for which people convicted of sexual abuse face additional criminal penalties<\/li>\n<li>Creates a new \u201corganized retail theft\u201d offense for planning\/directing theft from stores<\/li>\n<li>Ups the potential penalties for thefts of $500 worth of property or more<\/li>\n<li>Re-establishes a prohibition on wearing masks under certain circumstances (like for the purpose of concealing your identity while committing a crime or intimidating someone)<\/li>\n<li>Delays the implementation of a law that would ban cashless businesses<\/li>\n<li>Allows the police chief to designate certain areas \u201cdrug free zones\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Issues guidance for more nutrient-dense food at the D.C. Jail, and creates a hospitality vocational training program for people detained at the jail<\/li>\n<li>Creates a Director of Emerging Adult Services to work on improving city services like education programs, workforce development, housing, and health care for justice-involved young people aged 18-24<\/li>\n<li>Mandates that both law enforcement and the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice hold meetings to review recent shootings and target services\/interventions to people at risk of being shot (DMPSJ says these meetings are already happening)<\/li>\n<li>Allows police to force people who evade Metro fare to provide their true name and address, or be subject to a fine.<\/li>\n<li>Allows the agency that supervises people on probation to impose GPS monitoring on those who violate their conditions of release without an order from the court or the parole commission (The agency has been doing this, but the D.C. Court of Appeals recently ruled that it was unlawful \u2013 which means that without this explicitly written into D.C. law, hundreds of people would be taken off electronic monitoring)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To read the full bill and all of the amendments the council has passed, go to the D.C. Council\u2019s website <a href=\"https:\/\/lims.dccouncil.gov\/Legislation\/B25-0345\">here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you clarify what the latest version of the bill says about collecting DNA?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A previous version of Secure DC changed the rules for when law enforcement can collect DNA samples from people accused of crimes and enter them into a national database. It would have allowed law enforcement to collect a person\u2019s DNA at the time they are arrested. Then, it would allow law enforcement to analyze it and enter it into a national database either once the person has been charged with certain crimes or once a judge has determined that law enforcement had probable cause to arrest them. This provision was struck by an amendment before the council\u2019s first vote on the bill. As of now, Secure DC won\u2019t change the laws on DNA collection.<\/p>\n<p>Under current D.C. law, law enforcement can collect DNA samples from any person convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanor sexual abuse offenses and then enter them into an FBI database called \u201cCODIS,\u201d so that law enforcement agencies across the country can have access to the samples as they investigate crimes. Prosecutors can also obtain warrants for DNA samples from defendants during the course of a pending case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which criminal penalties are being changed? Does Secure DC create new mandatory minimums?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to changing penalties for some retail theft offenses, Secure DC would increase penalties for several gun possession offenses \u2013including possession of a machine gun or \u201cghost gun\u201d (the term commonly used to refer to a gun that people assemble at home, which doesn\u2019t have a serial number and is, therefore, less traceable to law enforcement).<\/p>\n<p>Secure DC would also create new gun offenses \u2013 like an offense for endangerment with a firearm (shooting a gun in public), an offense for discarding firearms and ammunition on someone else\u2019s property, and an offense for possessing a stolen gun or a gun with a tampered serial number.<\/p>\n<p>The bill also creates penalty enhancements for violent or dangerous crimes in certain locations \u2013 like Department of Parks and Recreation facilities \u2013 and crimes against certain groups of people, including vulnerable adults, Metro passengers and employees, and rideshare, taxicab, and food delivery drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Secure DC doesn\u2019t create any new mandatory minimums, but there are two new statutory minimums in the bill. The two are slightly different: under a mandatory minimum, people must serve the entire length of the sentence in prison \u2013 but a statutory minimum allows judges to release someone to probation, for example. The new statutory minimums are for possessing a firearm with an obliterated, removed, or altered serial number (people convicted of this crime would be subject to \u201cno less than 2 years nor more than 10 years\u201d of incarceration), and for possessing a firearm with intent to sell it (also \u201cno less than 2 years nor more than 10 years\u201d).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would the bill change the threshold for felony theft, and what is the intention behind this change?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Under current D.C. law, the definition of \u201cfirst-degree theft\u201d is stealing property that has a value of $1,000 or more. It\u2019s punishable by either a fine or a maximum of 10 years in prison. People who commit any kind of theft after being previously convicted of theft two or more times are subject to harsher penalties \u2014 including a mandatory minimum of one year in prison and a maximum of 15 years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>Secure DC would make the theft laws even stricter, by lowering the threshold for first-degree theft from $1,000 to $500. So under the law, people convicted of stealing $500 worth of property could be subject to that maximum 10-year sentence. Secure DC would also make it a felony to commit theft two or more times within six months if the aggregate value of the stolen property is $500 or more.<\/p>\n<p>The rationale behind the change is, essentially, that police will be more likely to arrest people \u2013 and prosecutors will be more likely to charge people \u2013 if they are more likely to receive some kind of punishment. Ward 2 Councilmember and Judiciary Committee chair Brooke Pinto, who is spearheading Secure DC, has said in hearings that she\u2019s repeatedly heard frustration from police officers and residents that people who steal are often \u201cno-papered,\u201d which means prosecutors don\u2019t pursue charges against them. (The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office might disagree with this characterization as of late; they recently released a spate of press releases announcing indictments of people for enhanced second-degree theft, which could potentially subject them to that mandatory minimum of one year in prison.)<\/p>\n<p>Critics of lowering the theft threshold argue it introduces disproportionate penalties, making an iPhone thief potentially subject to harsher penalties than someone convicted of misdemeanor sexual abuse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s been a lot of information going around about the face covering provisions of the bill. What does this section of the bill do? What would it mean for people who wear masks to protect against illness or people who wear religious face coverings?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Secure DC would make it illegal for any person over the age of 16 to wear a mask or any other kind of accessory that covers a substantial portion of their face in public \u2013 <em>but only under circumstances. <\/em>Those are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can\u2019t wear a mask to hide your identity while you commit a crime or engage in conduct prohibited by civil law<\/li>\n<li>You can\u2019t wear a mask if your intent is to deprive any person or class of people equal protection under the law<\/li>\n<li>You can\u2019t wear a mask to threaten, intimidate, abuse, or harass someone else<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An earlier version of Secure DC also made it illegal to wear a face covering with the intent of causing another person to \u201cfear for [their] physical safety.\u201d That piece was struck in an amendment proposed by At-Large Councilmember Christina Henderson, who worried it was overly broad and subjective.<\/p>\n<p>Pinto has said the rationale behind this provision is to give officers more discretion to stop people who they believe are wearing masks with the intent of committing a crime. Pinto\u2019s office says the law is structured in a way that prioritizes stopping the behavior, rather than immediately arresting someone for it.<\/p>\n<p>Some advocates say the language of the bill is still overly broad. The provision that criminalizes intimidating someone else while wearing a mask, for example, potentially makes it illegal to yell at someone while wearing a mask.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What new provisions roll back the measures put in place after George Floyd\u2019s death?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The bill changes reforms in several major areas:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Release of disciplinary records<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Secure DC changes a law the D.C. Council passed that would allow the public release of police disciplinary records (the law was not funded in the city budget, so it has not yet gone into effect). Under the not-yet-funded police reform law, the city would have been required to release information about officers\u2019 medical histories and their use of counseling programs \u2013 but only if the information was a material issue in a complaint against them, or if they were mandated to go to counseling through the disciplinary process. In contrast, Secure DC would explicitly allow the city to redact all of an officer\u2019s medical or counseling records.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Neck restraints<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Secure DC would change the city\u2019s laws governing police neck restraints. Under current law, a \u201cneck restraint\u201d is defined as any time a police officer applies pressure against a person\u2019s neck \u201cwith the purpose, intent, or effect of controlling or restricting the person\u2019s movement, blood flow, or breathing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The latest version of Secure DC would get rid of the word \u201cmovement\u201d and add an exception for times when an officer is acting in good faith to provide someone with medical care. So, the text of Secure DC defines a \u201cneck restraint\u201d as any time an officer applies pressure against a person\u2019s neck \u201cwith the purpose, intent, or effect of controlling or restricting the person\u2019s airway, blood flow, or breathing, except in cases where the law enforcement officer is acting in good faith to provide medical care or treatment, such as by providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Proponents of the bill say it addresses an issue that\u2019s come up in MPD, where officers are facing disciplinary action in cases where they were genuinely trying to help a person or protect them from themselves, or where their contact with a person\u2019s neck was accidental. Some opponents, however, worry that rolling back the restriction on controlling a person\u2019s movement goes too far.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Vehicular pursuits<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s police department has a strict policy on police vehicular pursuits, in recognition of the danger they present to the public in a crowded city. There is a history of fatal police pursuits in the District; in one recent case, a D.C. police officer was <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/12\/21\/terence-sutton-guilty-verdict-second-degree-murder\/\">found guilty<\/a> of second-degree murder for chasing 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown in his police cruiser; in the course of the chase, Hylton-Brown drove his scooter out of an alley and was hit by an oncoming vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>As part of a package of police reforms, the council made it illegal for police to engage in vehicular pursuits unless they have exhausted all other options and they believe that a fleeing suspect has a) committed or attempted to commit a crime of violence or b) poses an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury to another person. The law also says police can only pursue someone in a vehicle if the chase isn\u2019t likely to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person.<\/p>\n<p>Under emergency legislation the council passed over the summer, the policy was relaxed. Police pursuits are still limited to cases where it\u2019s the only remaining option for police, and where a fleeing suspect has committed or attempted to commit a crime of violence, but they are now allowed to chase someone who presents an \u201cimminent,\u201d not \u201cimmediate\u201d threat of death or serious bodily injury to another person. Under the emergency legislation, police are also no longer required to consider whether the chase would seriously injure the suspect. They can chase someone, the law says, if it is \u201cunder the totality of circumstances, not likely to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person, other than to the fleeing suspect or suspects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Secure DC adopts the same language as the emergency legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Body-worn cameras<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Secure DC reverses a law that prohibits officers from reviewing their body-worn camera footage before writing police reports, though it will still prohibit officers from reviewing their cameras in cases where they killed someone or used serious force against them.<\/p>\n<p>Supporters of the change say that it will allow police to write the most accurate possible reports because the footage is better than an officer\u2019s recollection. Policing experts at the Police Executive Research Forum <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/iso\/opa\/resources\/472014912134715246869.pdf\">argued in a recent publication<\/a> that if officers aren\u2019t allowed to view the footage before writing their report, discrepancies between their initial report and the footage could unfairly undermine their credibility in court, even when the officer had no intention of being deceptive.<\/p>\n<p>Opponents of the policy, including the Public Defender Service, argue that an officer\u2019s in-the-moment impression is an important, separate piece of evidence in a case. And they worry officers will insert things they see in the footage \u2013 but didn\u2019t notice at the moment \u2013 into their narrative of an event.<\/p>\n<p>Secure DC also does away with a requirement that police inform subjects that they\u2019re being recorded by their body-worn camera.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the bill\u2019s \u201cdrug-free zones\u201d provision. What would it do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The bill would allow D.C.\u2019s police chief to declare certain 1000-square-foot areas of the city \u201cdrug-free zones\u201d for set periods of time. Here\u2019s how it would work: the police chief could decide an area should be a \u201cdrug-free zone,\u201d and then the department would put up posters around that zone in advance to alert the public that the area will be designated as \u201cdrug-free.\u201d Then, for five days \u2014 and at most 15 days out of 30 days \u2014 it would be illegal to congregate in groups of two or more people for the purposes of committing a drug offense. If police reasonably believe people are committing a drug crime in the zone and they don\u2019t obey orders to disperse, officers can arrest them.<\/p>\n<p>It remains unclear how these drug-free zones would feel and look in practice. Critics of the policy worry it could enable harmful police harassment or simply disperse drug activity a short distance away. Some councilmembers have also questioned whether the policy would give police any new powers to address open-air drug activity in the city since they are already allowed to stop and arrest people who are breaking drug laws.<\/p>\n<p>But councilmembers who support the policy say they trust the police chief and Mayor when they say it would be a useful tool for police.<\/p>\n<p>In response to concerns from some other councilmembers, Pinto also added language to the bill that would force MPD to come up with protocols to make sure people seeking medical or social services near a drug-free zone wouldn\u2019t be discouraged from doing so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it possible any components of the law could be challenged in court?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s Office of the Attorney General has reviewed the bill and declared it legally sufficient, and D.C. Council chair Phil Mendelson says that means \u201cin terms of constitutional grounds, the council can be relatively comfortable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But it could certainly face court challenges.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe pass legislation that gets taken to court all the time,\u201d Mendelson told reporters at a recent press conference. \u201cWe try to craft it with an eye on whether it could withstand a judicial challenge, and that\u2019s what Councilmember Pinto has tried to do here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can I let my councilmember know how I feel about the bill?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can get in touch with them! Their emails and phone numbers are all public, <a href=\"https:\/\/dccouncil.gov\/councilmembers\/\">on the council\u2019s website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story was corrected to clarify that the version of Secure DC that was most recently amended would not have allowed law enforcement to enter someone\u2019s DNA evidence into a national database until after they have been charged wtih certain crimes or after a judge has determined there was probable cause to arrest them.<\/em><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The omnibus bill, called \u201cSecure DC,\u201d is expected to pass its second and final vote before the D.C.

They wait eagerly while Andr\u00e9s Salguero and Christina Sanabria \u2013 the music duo better known as 123 Andr\u00e9s \u2013 hide behind the stage curtains. They\u2019re about to put on a show for the kids, most of them bilingual Spanish speakers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUno, dos, tres, doce!\u201d says Salguero (who captures the moment on cellphone video) while Sanabria walks out dancing and clapping.<\/p>\n<p>He then belts out a long \u201cHola!\u201d in a sing-songy voice, and the crowd breaks into cheers before replying with their own \u201cHola.\u201d Some stand in excitement, while three kids can be seen holding up the flag of Colombia \u2013 Salguero\u2019s birth country, as well as Sanabria\u2019s parents. For many of the children, it\u2019s their first time seeing live music like this.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe feel a huge responsibility because each word we say, we know it\u2019s going to reach young ears. And maybe they fall in love with the song and they hear it over and over and over again,\u201d Salguero told DCist\/WAMU.<\/p>\n<p>Salguero and Sanabria, who are married and live in Fairfax, Va., have been performing for more than a decade throughout the D.C. region, as well as in cities across the United States, Panama, and Mexico.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005944\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 600px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005944\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/b528e589-ded0-4212-891a-299611325d93.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Sanabria and Salguero stand on the red carpet at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 4, 2024 in Los Angeles, Ca. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Vladimir Suarez<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In many ways, this performance in Greenville is no different \u2013 except for the fact that the duo are just a few days past a massive win at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Their 2023 release, <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/5vzydyTH7NXMcYB7ukoXjd?si=cnQwMUPTTwu4FVuxbC__9Q\"><em>We Grow Together, Preschool Songs<\/em><\/a>, won the best children\u2019s music album.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt did feel a little bit surreal, but then here we are 24 hours later, getting ready for a show at a theater with elementary school children,\u201d says Salguero told. \u201cIt was glamorous. But it was one day, and we\u2019re back to doing what we love doing. That is, visiting communities all over the country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s those same performances at local libraries and schools, especially throughout the D.C. region, that Sanabria credits for winning their award.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cD.C. was such a wonderful and supporting environment for us because there\u2019s so many families who love music, who want fun activities for their children, and who are interested in their children growing up with multiple languages,\u201d Sanabria told DCist\/WAMU.<\/p>\n<p>One of the duo\u2019s first performances was held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mrspl.org\/\">Mary Riley Styles Public Library<\/a> in Falls Church, Va., according to Sanabria. They\u2019ve gone on to play for kids throughout the region, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/alexlibraryva.org\/\">Alexandria Library<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcbilingual.org\/\">DC Bilingual Public Charter School<\/a>, and lots more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll those librarians and teachers and parents who took a chance on us,\u201d says Sanabria. \u201cIt\u2019s just very humbling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amy Sutton-Cannon, a youth services librarian for the Charles E. Beatley, Jr. Central Library in Alexandria, says it\u2019s a no-brainer for them to invite 123 Andr\u00e9s to perform for local events in recent years because of the atmosphere they create for kids and parents alike.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I AM BRAVE! - Self-confidence song for kids - with Plane, Train, Bike, Bus - &quot;I&#039;m not scared!&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BrDv-8Tjvvc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo one exemplifies joy like Andr\u00e9s and Christina,\u201d says Sutton-Cannon. \u201cThey\u2019re great musicians and they\u2019re big proponents of the library, but I think they have this exuberance that really captures an audience and builds a connection with them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The award-winning album <em>We Grow Together, Preschool Songs<\/em> was written as a way to help preschool-aged children work on basic shapes and colors, as well as social-emotional learning. While not a direct translation, says Sanabria, the songs are crafted with melodies and rhymes that work in both English and Spanish.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s songs with really nuanced messages that we love,\u201d says Sanabria. \u201cMany classrooms, many teachers are using these songs every day to explore all of these topics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a former teacher herself, Sanabria says it\u2019s rewarding to be able to write pieces like \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/track\/0z35JwUKj4Rqvqcu4pIb0k?si=e72cbf2035ee4a8f\">Special As Can Be<\/a>\u201d for kids to reinforce, in the first-person, their own self esteem and value.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so powerful to see these classes of kiddos \u2013 singing that song, jamming to it \u2013 and that it\u2019s an affirmation and a sentiment that they really internalize. \u2018I\u2019m special, I am brave, I can ask for help. I can do it,\u2019\u201d says Sanabria.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005946\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 1598px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005946\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/IMG_6858-e1707934229712.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1598\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">123 Andr\u00e9s performs at the DC Bilingual Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Daniela Anello<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As an immigrant from Colombia, Salguero says they\u2019re also filling a specific need for immigrant families.

Because we got the Grammy. Yeah, that\u2019s amazing. But that? Being part of a culture, being part of Latine culture in the US?

warmer weather to come, it\u2019s possible to take a break and escape to your idea of vacation bliss without going too far from home in the D.C. region.<\/p>\n<p>While we certainly cannot control the weather, we\u2019ve got recommendations for quick getaways that can provide respite no matter your vacation vibe \u2014 whether you\u2019re a curl up by the fire type of person, or someone who wants to be whizzing down a mountain until (or after) the sun goes down.<\/p>\n<p>From ski resorts where snowmaking happens even if there\u2019s no white stuff falling, to spa-like atmospheres that transport you straight to summer, here are a few accessible trips that are either a short drive or train trip away from D.C.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005830\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"

\u2026\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.massresort.com\/\"><strong>Massanutten Resort<\/strong><\/a>, Massanutten, Virginia<\/p>\n<p>Massanutten is a family-friendly ski resort less than three hours away from D.C. with a consistently good snow pack for skiing, snowboarding, and snow tubing. New this year, the mountain is able to offer just as much in the daredevil heights department as it does bunny hill action, thanks to a new double black diamond ski trail that opened in January. Off the slopes, winter lovers can take advantage of ice skating, street curling, and a raucous ski lodge that turns into a live music venue at night, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.massresort.com\/play\/the-rink\/\">Elevations Lounge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s nice about Massanutten is that it has a variety of price points: there are single accommodations starting at just $115 per night for a midweek stay, all the way up to a full mountain house that can easily accommodate six to eight guests for $300 per night. Lift tickets also come with savings if you\u2019re a college student, active or retired military, or come on off-peak days or times like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.massresort.com\/play\/snow-sports\/snow-specials\/\">Monday Night Madness<\/a> events.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not there to ski, Massanutten is a four-season resort with plenty of other activities, including: Top Golf, escape rooms, an arcade, and a waterpark with an adjoining tiki bar and plenty of beach loungers nearby. (We know we said it\u2019s for winter lovers, but actually, it\u2019s kind of for both.)<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005832\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1115px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005832\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/WEB_Savage-River-Lodge-Select-Registry-Lodge-exterior.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1115\" height=\"720\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Savage River Lodge is surrounded by 700 acres of state forestland. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Savage River Lodge<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savageriverlodge.com\/\"><strong>Savage River Lodge<\/strong><\/a>,\u00a0Frostburg, Maryland<\/p>\n<p>With a name like Frostburg, you better bundle up for snowy conditions. This rural Western Maryland town is filled with Main Street charm, plus plenty of restaurants, like <a href=\"https:\/\/clattertogo.square.site\/\">Clatter Cafe<\/a> for breakfast bites and espresso coffees, <a href=\"https:\/\/toastedgoatwinery.com\/restaurant\">The Toasted Goat<\/a> for a no-fuss lunch option that doubles as a winery, or a rocking and rowdy time at <a href=\"https:\/\/thebeachcluboffrostburg.com\/\">The Beach Club<\/a> bar. Yes, that\u2019s right winter haters, there\u2019s a beach club in Frostburg, Maryland.<\/p>\n<p>Your best bet for an overnight stay in this mountainside escape is at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.savageriverlodge.com\/\">Savage River Lodge.<\/a> It includes rustic cabins with fireplaces, heated yurts, and a main lodge surrounded by 700 acres of state forestland for winter hiking, cross country skiing, or snowshoeing adventures. Those that wish to stay indoors can puzzle in the main lobby or cozy up to the volumes of books or a board game in the upstairs library.<\/p>\n<p>Savage River Lodge is also a pet friendly destination that\u2019s accessible by car or rail \u2014 it\u2019s a three-hour drive or 5-hour train ride via Amtrak (to Frostburg) and then from there it\u2019s a short drive to the property. (This being rural Maryland, there is limited Uber service, so it is best to reserve a car service in advance with one of the outfitting transport services or the local taxi company.) Those planning to drive should also check weather conditions before you go. Access to the lodge and property is at times only accessible via four-wheel or all-wheel-drive vehicle, and can be difficult to navigate in icy conditions.<\/p>\n<p>However you get here, train nerds may also want to plan their trip around the Western Maryland Scenic Rails.

It is also the site of a famous Cold War fallout shelter for Congress kept secret by the government until the early 1990s. (Because it\u2019s accessible via Amtrak, the idea was that this is where all 535 members of Congress would escape to if ever a bomb was to drop over D.C.)<\/p>\n<p>Crazy as that sounds, guests can now descend beneath the Greenbrier\u2019s West Wing to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenbrier.com\/activities\/bunker-tours\/\">tour this clandestine bunker<\/a> buried deep into bedrock. Today, the bunker is home to server farms for tech companies looking to keep their infrastructure secure and at a consistent temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to keep warm here is to opt for a dip in the elaborate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenbrier.com\/activities\/indoor-pool\/\">indoor pool<\/a>, or to book one of the hot springs treatments in the spa. Greenbrier\u2019s hydrotherapy session includes a soak in two rejuvenating waters drawn from the hot springs located on property. If you book a two-night, weeknight stay (Sunday through Thursday through March) you will receive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenbrier.com\/offers\/spa-package\/\">a spa allowance of up to $1,000<\/a> to use for this and other treatments like a Swedish massage, firming facial, or manicure-pedicure. The resort also offers special rates <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenbrier.com\/luxury-escape-special\/\">for the first week of March<\/a> available starting at $125 per person.<\/p>\n<p>The entire hotel complex is also connected by indoor shopping arcades, restaurants, bars, and a privately-run casino, meaning you can ignore the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeswv.com\/news\/wild-wonderful-west-virginia-slogan-has-history-dating-to-1969\/article_45980471-9fa8-5ab9-9c58-4eda0abe54d7.html\">\u201cwild and wonderful\u201d<\/a> wintertime aspects of West Virginia if you please.

Not an issue at Stone Tower Winery in Leesburg. Their chalet-themed huts are designed to look like ski gondolas, and are a cozy environment to sip and savor wine flights while staying warm this winter.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2009, Stone Tower\u2019s on-site vineyard has produced wines in several French styles including chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, and Bordeaux-style blends. They also have expanded to other European-style wines like nebbiolo and Rhone, going beyond the standard cabernet franc you tend to see at Northern Virginia wineries.<\/p>\n<p>We love Stone Tower for its close proximity to D.C. It\u2019s only an hour drive away from the city or a 90 minute ride on the Silver Line to the Ashburn Station. From there you can hail a rideshare to the winery, which is approximately 15-20 minutes by car. Or you can plan to stay the night <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stonetowerwinery.com\/accommodations\">at one of two vacation rental properties<\/a> located only a half-mile from the winery that are perfect for small groups or a family weekend stay.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Whether you&#8217;d rather stay warm by a fireplace or in a sauna, or feel the wind and snow on your face, there

He started taking the bus because he got caught driving without a license, and he quickly learned how to deal with the groups of boisterous kids that rode it to school, he says. Pointing to each one, he\u2019d threaten to \u201cfry them up,\u201d or make up a rap about them on the spot, if they said something disrespectful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It didn\u2019t take long before the kids were begging for Kokamoe to fry them up. Something is entrancing about Kokamoe\u2019s old-school hip-hop wordplay: \u201cI can do it without cussing,\u201d he tells <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/topic\/voices-of-wards-7-and-8\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voices of Wards 7 and 8<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/lifestyle\/magazine\/rappers-delight\/2015\/07\/27\/7f39f1a4-24c8-11e5-b72c-2b7d516e1e0e_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">former D.C. drug dealer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who has been shot and stabbed, Kokamoe has come a long way to heal his wounds, and he knows it.

The given name is Thomas, last name \u201cGoode\u201d \u2013 not in Hollywood, but in my neighborhood. The nickname is Kokamoe, the reason why it\u2019s called a nickname is because a person named Nick gave me that name (laughs).<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>How do you get the name Kokamoe? \u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gambling (craps).\u00a0 \u2018Little Joe from Kokomo,\u201d that\u2019s what everybody says when they\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/www.casinocitytimes.com\/linda-mabry\/article\/deciphering-the-language-of-craps-26214\">gambling<\/a>. The point four for \u2018Little Joe, from Kokomo\u2019. I always liked to gamble when I was younger and that was my favorite, point four. So I just kept the name \u201cLittle Joe from Kokomo\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>What do you do for a living? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m an electrical contractor. I turn on lights and put in plugs. That\u2019s going to always have some type of living, especially with your own business. As with me being an electrical contractor, I want to give some of these youngins and some other people [the opportunity] to learn electrical skills. When they go on a job from my training, at least they\u2019ll be able to know what they\u2019re doing and understand what goes on in life.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0I think I\u2019ve been doing electrical work [for] 32 years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Did you grow up seeing art in your community? How did we get here?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t even know. I think that came from back when I would listen to my grandmother. She used to be singing in her church, church music! She would be singing at night in church, singing her church songs.\u00a0\u00a0But I\u2019m just listening because most of the time I\u2019m on punishment and not going out.\u00a0But as I\u2019m listening to her, I can hear some melody and tone, and then I could hear my mother and them downstairs, they\u2019re cranking too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I\u2019m indulged in all the music, but at the same time, I\u2019m looking at their lifestyle like, damn, they\u2019re good but they\u2019re doing grown-up stuff. The main thing I took on was the singing. Somebody [could] be arguing, and next thing you know a song comes on, and they\u2019re all back in rhythm.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>When did you first start rapping?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was at Capitol Cab. They had a DJ outside, you know how they have those little functions at the park. Everybody had a function at the park. So this DJ, he was playing his oldies but goodies, everybody wasn\u2019t up to tempo. [While there] I sang \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xag5RKD0VHk\">the family affair<\/a>\u2018 song.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody loved for me to sing that song every time they came around, then they started to pay me for it. That\u2019s how I started. When I was singing it, I can see [that] everybody was amazed because [it] looked like we were all a family.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What do you think it is about your message that makes people smile and be in rhythm?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The way I see it is, it\u2019s the way it\u2019s presented \u2013 because it can be said any type of way.\u00a0 But you can feel it, how a person says something.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong>Why the bus..how did you get there?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to drive without a license, I got my license taken a long time ago. I\u2019ll never forget the time I had a customer with me, and it was hot, and the police pulled me over. They made us walk on the highway. So from that point on, I said \u2018Man it ain\u2019t even worth driving no more. Why\u2026I keep getting caught up!\u2019 So I started catching a bus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So as I\u2019m getting on the bus, the little kids just be so disrespectful and so \u2018woo woo woo\u2019. I go to the back and all the kids be loud. And I say, \u2018You say something, I\u2019ma fry you up. You say something I\u2019ma fry you up. She say something I\u2019ma fry her up. Any one of y\u2019all say something and I\u2019ma fry somebody up.\u2019\u00a0 And then they\u2019re all quiet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once they\u2019re quiet I decide to pick on them anyway and I start rapping. And as I start rapping\u2026the best thing about it is I can rap without cussing. And I was rapping about everything they had on, everything from each one of them. And they used to love that. They used to get on the bus and say \u2018Kokomoe fry me up, fry me up.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0They used to love that. \u00a0They understood my terminology. The kids started being late for school. Just so they would go to school, I\u2019d get off the bus where their school was.<\/p>\n<p>Then the kids were being late for school, that\u2019s what really made them [teachers] mad. I\u2019d get off the bus where their school was [so they can go in]. A lot of those kids that have graduated have become rappers. A lot of them have done things off my influence, they\u2019ll tell you.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-3.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>D.C. legend and longtime rapper Kokamoe freestyles at the X2 bus stop as a fan looks on. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-13.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe boards the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-4.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe freestyling on the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-6.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe waiting for the X2 bus. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Dee-Dwyer_Kokamoe_DCist-2.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kokamoe freestyles at the X2 bus stop.<span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><em><strong>When was that moment that you noticed you started receiving love in the city?

spot where The Beatles held their first official concert in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Two days after their historic debut <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jenWdylTtzs\">on the Ed

It was the same arena where President Dwight D. Eisenhower had held an inaugural ball, boxing champion Joe Louis launched his stint in wrestling, and Malcolm X spoke on several occasions.<\/p>\n<p>But it was a location also better suited for boxing matches, hockey, and basketball games, and the 8,000 young fans who showed up screaming from excitement\u00a0made it nearly impossible to hear the 35-minute set.

Other radio stations around the country played recorded versions of that segment, and Capitol Records, in turn, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/archive\/local\/1997\/03\/28\/deejay-carroll-james-dies\/3c3a79a8-1418-44b9-bc6f-6377fca92b6b\/\">released the record<\/a> in the U.S. the day after Christmas, six weeks earlier than the label had originally planned.<\/p>\n<p>When Beatles manager Brian Epstein called Harry Lynn, owner of the Washington Coliseum, to see if the band could play there, Lynn had never heard of them, according to former WAMU host Rebecca Sheir\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/14\/02\/07\/beatles\/\">segment<\/a>. But Lynn agreed to give the group access to the biggest venue they\u2019d played so far, and ran a single ad in The Washington Post advertising the show. Tickets were put on sale for $2, $3, and $4 at local record stores.<\/p>\n<p>On the night of Feb. 11, the Fab Four took the stage: a square platform in the middle of thousands of screaming fans, who pelted the band with jelly beans. (They had mentioned in a magazine article that they liked Jelly Babies, a much softer candy.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was pretty chaotic,\u201d Spizer says. \u201cBut when you look at the video, you can see how much fun they\u2019re having and how much energy there is.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Beatles - Live At The Washington Coliseum  02 11 1964 - 5 songs\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ctxx73Xj5F0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>They played a short set, mostly covers of songs by Black American rock artists, including \u201cRoll Over Beethoven\u201d by Chuck Berry, the Isley Brothers\u2019 \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d and \u201cLong Tall Sally\u201d by Little Richard.<\/p>\n<p>Over the screams, The Beatles also played their first hits \u2014 \u201cI Saw Her Standing There,\u201d \u201cShe Loves You,\u201d and \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand.\u201d There were special moments, never to be replicated, such as a rendition of \u201cThis Boy\u201d during which Paul McCartney, John Lennon, and George Harrison <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ctxx73Xj5F0?si=5WlNpty39pOVH6Qe&amp;t=645\">harmonized together on one microphone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/14\/02\/07\/beatles\/\">Fans who attended<\/a> have never gotten over the experience. The Beatles were amazed by the enthusiasm of their first U.S. audience; later that night, Lennon called the show \u201cmarvelous\u201d at a reception at the British Embassy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An unwelcome reception<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before continuing their East Coast tour back to New York and then onto Miami Beach, Epstein, their manager, had them stop at a party at the British Embassy. The four were swarmed by fans and members of the press, mostly older men who didn\u2019t understand Beatlemania. Beverly Rubin, an 18-year-old who snuck into the party, managed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2014\/01\/27\/looking-back-on-when-the-beatles-came-to-washington\/\">cut off a piece of Ringo Starr\u2019s hair<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t too happy about that,\u201d Spizer says. \u201cThey kind of felt like they were being put on parade.\u201d The band told Epstein they didn\u2019t want to do that type of thing again, Spizer says. \u201cBut as far as the concert itself, they absolutely raved about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Beatles British Embassy Reception - CBS News - 11 February 1964\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7iPkNi-GOjQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>While the party dampened their moods, they still rode high after their concert at the Coliseum.

Over 2,000 people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/f\/save-as-you-are?member=32231049&amp;sharetype=teams&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;utm_content=ai_control2&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer\">have donated to its GoFundMe<\/a> since Monday, when owners Rach Pike and Jo McDaniel went public with their financial struggles and sought help from supporters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The owners <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/f\/save-as-you-are\">need $150,000 to avoid a closure,<\/a> a goal they\u2019ve nearly met with $134,388 raised by press time. The outpouring of support speaks to the queer locus As You Are has become since opening roughly two years ago on Barracks Row in Southeast D.C.: a place for women, femmes, thems, and, as McDaniel says affectionately, queerdos.<\/p>\n<p>The donations will allow the owners to get out of survival mode, pay off debt, and plan for the future of their bar\/<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">caf\u00e9, they say. They rent the space for their establishment now but hope the donated funds will help them qualify for grants that will enable them to purchase a permanent home for As You Are. <\/span>The daily operations and ethos of As You Are, which is more akin to a community center than bar, make it harder to sustain, but at the same time that\u2019s what makes it unique, needed, and worth the trouble, according to the owners and patrons.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u201cI am soggy with gratitude. I\u2019m almost limp by it,\u201d McDaniel tells DCist\/WAMU of the donations. \u201cBut ultimately, what it means is this fight is worth it.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> McDaniel and Pike, who goes by Coach, are working behind the counter the day we talk. The owners, who have 30 years of hospitality experience between the two of them, tend their own bar sometimes to save money; they also haven\u2019t taken a salary since mid-2021. <\/span>As You Are was hit particularly hard by a sales slump last year that started in the summer \u2014 generally a slow time for the bar and restaurant industry. During these slow months, <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">partners in life and in business <\/span>prioritized paying their staff, a crew of 14 plus others hired for events. Then, they prioritized keeping the lights on and food in the kitchen. Consequently, they fell behind on rent and taxes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t bounce back,\u201d <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">McDaniel says. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving also wasn\u2019t an option, because with a 10-year lease, breaking it would be more expensive than the business just continuing to hobble along, she adds. McDaniel says their landlord refused to renegotiate a lease that is based on sales so overhead could be more manageable. (The landlord did not respond to request for comment.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Crowdsourcing was the last thing they wanted to do, McDaniel says. They searched for other funding opportunities for six months but found nothing they qualified for. The owners did not want to unexpectedly shut their doors without warning people who\u2019ve come to depend on As You Are. So they asked for help.<\/p>\n<p>The couple were also motivated to pay of their debt after attending <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/24\/01\/29\/dc-new-grants-downtown-businesses-downtown-recovery\/\">a expo hosted by Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s team on available retail grants<\/a>. At that expo Monday, they learned of a grant that helps businesses with down payment assistance if owners want to purchase a property. To qualify, Pike and McDaniel need \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/otr.cfo.dc.gov\/page\/certificate-clean-hands\">clean hands<\/a>,\u201d meaning they cannot owe more than $100 in fees, fines, or taxes to the city. So after the expo, the couple posted their GoFundMe campaign for an amount that would leave them debt-free to the city and their landlord. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allwevegot.org\/\"><em>All We\u2019ve Got<\/em> <\/a>documentary, which is about property ownership of queer bars, also inspired Pike and McDaniel.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCapitalism is capitalism,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cIf you own this space, they can\u2019t kick you out,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the long term goal for As You Are \u2014 is to find a way to get those grants and and to purchase a property that is ours.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005576\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005576\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/IMG_0448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">\u201cIt really feels like they\u2019ve tried to make a space that\u2019s as welcoming to as many people as possible,\u201d says As You Are patron Shiv Sharma. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Amanda Michelle Gomez \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Lesbian bars struggle to survive because both owners and patrons, who are women and gender nonconforming, don\u2019t have as much disposable income due to the gender wage gap, or access to capital due to entrenched patriarchy in the business world, documentary <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lesbianbarproject.com\/\">Lesbian Bar Project<\/a> <\/em>explains. Queer owners of queer spaces also face discrimination when they operate their business, per McDaniel.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taken less seriously by the vendors we work with,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are reasons that there are products we don\u2019t carry. There are companies we don\u2019t work with because they don\u2019t take us seriously as a business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/01\/26\/dc-queer-space-as-you-are-bar-jo-mcdaniel-rach-pike-anc-deal\/\">Opening As You Are Bar proved difficult<\/a>, requiring lots of back-and-forth with neighbors \u2014 some of whom opposed it \u2014 before the 2022 debut. But in the years since, As You Are became a cherished space for the\u00a0 LGBTQIA+ community. While some gay and lesbian bars <a href=\"https:\/\/www.them.us\/story\/lesbian-bar-project-documentary-trailer\">have failed to reflect<\/a> growing gender diversity, As You Are succeeded in being as inclusive as it could be, including by hosting trans nights on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n<p>What sets it apart is not just that As You Are creates a welcoming, safe place for queer people to drink and party \u2014 but that it\u2019s been able to be many things for many people. Think drag queen and king nights, corn hole tournaments, and crafting and reading nights where patrons wear name tags that signal whether they want to socialize or not. As You Are is there to enable patrons to forge friendships or casual connections, or simply create comfortable alone time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt really feels like they\u2019ve tried to make a space that\u2019s as welcoming to as many people as possible,\u201d says Shiv Sharma, a patron who was working at the caf\u00e9\u00a0on a recent weekday afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma loves that you don\u2019t have to drink to have a good time at As You Are. They also appreciate that different rooms of the two-level space have different vibes \u2014 there\u2019s a dance floor, but also a room with couches and TVs \u2014 to accommodate people of various energy levels.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/lifestyle\/2023\/06\/08\/consent-bar-as-you-are\/\">read about As You Are<\/a> before moving to D.C. and knew they wanted to patronize it when they got here due to that range of vibes, as well as the bar\u2019s emphasis on consent. They\u2019ve become a regular, attending various events including Sunday karaoke for their birthday.<\/p>\n<p>Because of their experience at As You Are, they aren\u2019t surprised that the queer community came through and donated when the owners asked for help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKnowing how Joe and Coach always show up for the community here, I just knew that the community would show up for them,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cBecause of how this space has allowed so many different groups and so many different individuals to be themselves, to do their work, to promote their causes.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005574\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005574 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/IMG_0456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">As You Are is also a place for creatives.

The space has served as a much needed respite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/podcast\/why-and-how-trans-hate-is-spreading\">from the onslaught of hate the trans community, in particular, has faced in recent times<\/a>, he says. Other queer bars can be toxic for any queer who is not \u201cHGTV gay friendly,\u201d Hennessy adds.<\/p>\n<p>As You Are gives back in more than one way. Hennessy recalls a recent event, where people paid for tattoos and bowls of soup and all the proceeds went to the local chapter of the Palestinian Youth Movement. The owners also always hire ASL interpreters for mic\u2019d events at their own expense, which has totaled at least $20,000 to date, per McDaniel. And they don\u2019t have a cover charge for events, because they don\u2019t want to inadvertently exclude the community they intend to serve. Similarly, As You Are pays all their talent, which is not a given for drag performers and musicians, who often work for tips at bars.<\/p>\n<p>As You Are fans and its owners are optimistic the community will keep the bar off <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/12\/26\/dc-restaurant-bar-closures-2023\/\">the list of beloved bars and restaurants that have shuttered<\/a> around D.C. recently. As they get closer to that $150,000 fundraising goal, they can see a future where they own their own building for As You Are, or maybe it\u2019s owned by the community through a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/haydengise\/status\/1754715003477762556\">public ownership<\/a> model \u2014 to keep it alive for the years to come.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re so grateful and we\u2019re

Tell me a little bit about what that was like.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well I went to segregated public schools in the District of Columbia. We had no vote, there was no mayor and no legislative body. That was the Washington I grew up in.<\/p>\n<p>My parents, my teachers, all talked about the way in which the District of Columbia was treated, so I was very aware that we were treated as second class citizens. I remember the teachers were intent upon making students understand that they lived in a city that was unequal.

We still have a Congress that can overturn any law that the District of Columbia passes. Whatever are the current issues \u2014 abortion, marijuana, gun rights \u2013 Republicans in Congress tend to look to make sure that the District is not treated as other Americans are.

rights","content":"<p>When D.C. won home rule 50 years ago, creating an elected local government, nobody saw it as a perfect or permanent solution to the District\u2019s lack of voting rights. Supporters thought it would just be a first step, followed quickly by full representation in Congress. Spoiler alert: It didn\u2019t happen that way.<\/p>\n<p>Half a century later, Washingtonians still don\u2019t enjoy the same rights as other American citizens. D.C. residents do elect their own local officials, but laws those officials pass can be overturned by Congress; D.C. residents elect a delegate to Congress, but that delegate has no vote.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, most advocates for D.C. voting rights have come to see statehood as the best way to secure those rights. They see 2024 as a pivotal year for the movement.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005238\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005238 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/20240202_STATEHOOD_Fenston2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">A bowl of pro-statehood buttons and stickers at the home of activist Anne Anderson. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Jacob Fenston \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h4>Home rule, or home fool?<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cI was sort of lukewarm on home rule,\u201d says Anne Anderson, who moved to D.C. in the \u201960s, as the push for home rule was ramping up.<\/p>\n<p>She joined the D.C. Statehood Party. It was brand new, set up by Civil Rights activist Julius Hobson.<\/p>\n<p>Hobson called home rule, \u201chome fool.\u201d He argued home rule was merely a tactic to \u201cpacify and confuse\u201d residents of the majority Black city, a distraction from full rights, rather than a step toward attaining them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5004962\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5004962\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/01\/Julius-Hobson-in-a-Votemobile.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1072\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">The Washington Committee on Black Power Votemobile, with Julius Hobson, wearing his signature fedora, in the passenger seat. <a href=\"https:\/\/digdc.dclibrary.org\/islandora\/object\/dcplislandora%3A118009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Washington Star Photograph Collection \/ D.C.

I thought we already deserved it; being an American citizen, you get to have some rights.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Anderson later went on to join the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lwv.org\/local-leagues\/lwv-district-columbia\">League of Women Voters of D.C<\/a>., where she is now chair of the group\u2019s committee for full rights for D.C. citizens.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of D.C. statehood has been around for a long time, first bubbling up in the 19th century. But until recently it was not a terribly popular cause, says historian George Derek Musgrove, co-author of the book \u201cChocolate City: A History Of Race And Democracy In The Nation\u2019s Capital.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStatehood in the \u201970s is this sort of far fetched radical fringe. If you look at the membership of the Statehood Party, just to give you an illustration, by 1979, 1% of registered voters are members,\u201d Musgrove says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005240\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005240 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/20240202_STATEHOOD_Fenston3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Anne Anderson, a statehood activist with the League of Women Voters. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Jacob Fenston \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In the years since, though, other options for giving D.C. voters full rights have fallen flat. There was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have treated D.C. like a state in terms of representation, with two senators and one representative in the House.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, it passes Congress in 1978. It\u2019s defeated before the states, unfortunately,\u201d Musgrove says.<\/p>\n<p>There were various other, less ambitious plans too, like giving blue D.C. one voting representative, balanced out by adding one new representative for a red state. That failed in 2009 when Republicans added an amendment that would have overturned the District\u2019s gun control laws.<\/p>\n<h4>\u2018I felt like a second class citizen\u2019<\/h4>\n<p>Jamal Holtz was born and raised in D.C., in Ward 8. He remembers the moment that turned him into a statehood activist: he was a teenager when Congress was considering defunding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare in the mid-2010s.<\/p>\n<p>The issue was important to him, as his own family had struggled to afford good health care.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005239\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005239 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/20240202_STATEHOOD_Fenston5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Jamal Holz grew up a few miles from the U.S. Capitol, a place where he has no vote. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Jacob Fenston \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cMy mom was under-insured, and so I had experiences where I\u2019d visit hospitals and doctors and was denied treatment just on the basis of the type of insurance that I had. I actually do have a permanent scar on the back of my head because of it,\u201d Holtz says.<\/p>\n<p>Holtz wanted to advocate for the Affordable Care Act, and President Obama had a straightforward way to do it: he said call your senators.<\/p>\n<p>But Holz, along with nearly 700,000 other D.C. residents, didn\u2019t have a senator.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTruly, I felt like I was a second class citizen,\u201d Holtz recalls.<\/p>\n<p>With a handful of other young D.C. residents, he started the group 51 for 51. The idea was to make D.C. the 51st state with 51 votes in the Senate, bypassing the filibuster.<\/p>\n<h4>District of Columbia -&gt; Douglass Commonwealth<\/h4>\n<p>By 2016, District leaders had coalesced around the statehood idea. Under a president Hillary Clinton, they thought there would be a real chance.<\/p>\n<p>Mayor Muriel Bowser convened a constitutional convention to hammer out some of the details of the new state.<\/p>\n<p>It would be called Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, retaining the abbreviation, D.C. The new state would comprise 66 square miles. This would leave a 2 square mile federal district around the National Mall, to be administered by Congress.<\/p>\n<p>This would split apart the federal district \u2014 filled with marble monuments and authorized by the U.S. Constitution \u2014 from the bustling city where hundreds of thousands of people live and work and go to school. The Constitution stipulates that the federal district can\u2019t exceed 10 miles by 10 miles in area \u2014 hence the District\u2019s diamond shape, with its 10-mile-long sides. In 1846, the Virginia chunk of the diamond retroceded, leaving today\u2019s partial diamond, bounded on one side by the Potomac River. Statehood backers say Congress could again shrink the federal district, this time ceding most of the land to a new state.<\/p>\n<p>In a referendum in November, 2016, 86 percent of D.C. residents voted in favor of statehood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut then everyone woke up the next day and found out that a president who doesn\u2019t support D.C. statehood was elected, which was not what people were planning for,\u201d says statehood activist Josh Burch.<\/p>\n<p>President Trump was not a statehood guy.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the \u201970s D.C. home rule was a bipartisan issue, signed into law by President Nixon. But since then, the fight for D.C. voting rights has hardened along party lines. The last time statehood made it to a vote in the House, in 2021, Republicans railed against it as being unconstitutional, and just a bad idea.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nothing but a naked power play today. That\u2019s all this is about \u2014 people who can\u2019t get their radical agenda passed under the system our framers set up now want to blow it up,\u201d said Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005242\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005242\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/Pelosi-statehood-vote-2020.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Nancy Pelosi, with D.C.

Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin said D.C. would \u201cdo a horrible job as a state.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are more homeless here than 29 states. And if they were to become a state, it would immediately be the state with the highest murder rate in the country,\u201d Grothman said.<\/p>\n<p>The bill, H.R. 51, passed the House, along party lines. In fact, the House has passed statehood three times in the past few years, but it\u2019s failed in the Senate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLegislatively, we have never been closer to statehood, and at the same time, we have never been closer to potentially having home rule completely repealed,\u201d Burch says.<\/p>\n<h4>The strategy for 2024 and beyond<\/h4>\n<p>What happens next with statehood hinges on this November: who wins the White House and Congress.<\/p>\n<p>If Republicans win, statehood activists worry there\u2019s a real chance home rule could be rolled back or curtailed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are people in the House of Representatives majority right now who want to repeal Home Rule, and that probably sells well to people in their district back home,\u201d Burch says.<\/p>\n<p>But Democrats haven\u2019t been steadfast supporters either.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey have sold us out many a time,\u201d Burch says. In fact, it was anger at Democrats that spurred Burch to become an activist. It was in the lead up to a possible government shutdown in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPresident Obama said to Speaker Boehner, in order to keep the federal government open, \u2018I\u2019m not happy about it, John, but I\u2019ll give you D.C. abortion.\u2019 He used the District\u2019s right to fund abortion services for for low-income women as a bargaining chip to keep the federal government open,\u201d says Burch, who went on to start the group Neighbors United For D.C. Statehood.<\/p>\n<p>Burch and other activists felt betrayed \u2014 D.C. had voted overwhelmingly for Obama, and Obama had said he supported D.C. statehood and D.C. autonomy. More recently, President Biden also claimed to support autonomy, but then allowed Congress to overturn D.C.\u2019s criminal code revision last year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005192\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005192 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/210422_D.C._Statehood_Turner05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Ward 8 resident Genevieve Ali stands at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Ave and Malcolm X Ave SE. with D.C. statehood signs, ahead of a statehood vote in 2021. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Tyrone Turner \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If Democrats win this November, activists say the next step is to make sure D.C. is part of any conversation about voting rights.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to be assertive to ensure that our voices are not sidelined. I mean, we saw that two years ago, people fighting for much needed legislation across the country that related to voter suppression, and D.C. statehood was left out of the conversation in many instances,\u201d Holz says.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, activists say any effort to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would update and strengthen the 1965 Voting Rights Act, should also include D.C. statehood. Passing either one, or both, would likely require not just Democratic control of Congress and the White House, but also suspension of the filibuster.\u00a0There are unlikely to be the 60 votes needed in the senate to overcome a filibuster on statehood legislation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do know a lot of senators, democracy loving senators, have been really troubled that the filibuster has been used to stop efforts to make our democracy more fair and equitable and inclusive, and the statehood bill is a piece of that,\u201d says Burch.<\/p>\n<p>Fifty years ago, the District won home rule after D.C. rights got swept up in the momentum of the Civil Rights Movement. In the same way, activists say, statehood can only happen if it\u2019s part of the larger fight to defend democracy and prevent voter suppression.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is voter suppression from 1801,\u201d says Anderson. That was the last time D.C. residents were able to vote for members of Congress.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>D.C. residents still have no vote in the House or Senate, 50 years after getting home rule.

Celebrate Newly Gained Right To Vote","content":"<p>Antonia Diaz is filling out a voter registration form first-thing on a Monday morning at the D.C. Board of Elections. To her left is one of the advocates who brought her to the agency in southeast Washington, D.C. On her right, is an elections worker who translates and explains the paperwork required for her to take part in local elections.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s Diaz\u2019s first time doing this, along with Ana Lemus and her daughter, Genesis. The three are among the first residents to take advantage of a <a href=\"https:\/\/code.dccouncil.gov\/us\/dc\/council\/laws\/24-242#:~:text=Local%20Resident%20Voting%20Rights%20Amendment%20Act%20of%202022.,-AN%20ACT&amp;text=To%20amend%20the%20District%20of,otherwise%20eligible%20non%2Dcitizen%20residents.\">new law<\/a> that <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/15\/bill-allowing-non-citizen-voting-clears-congress\/\">expanded local voting rights to non-citizens<\/a> in D.C. They can now register to vote and cast their ballot in future elections for mayor, council, attorney general, state board of education, and more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThank God, we are [being] taken into account,\u201d says Diaz, who was born in Guatemala.<\/p>\n<p>A District resident for about two decades now, Diaz says she raised her two children here. For many of those years, she worked as a street vendor with a food truck. She paid taxes and license fees, she says, until a $3,000 fine (for which she joined <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/06\/21\/dc-street-vendors-lawsuit-clean-hands-law\/\">a lawsuit<\/a> against the District) set her back financially during the pandemic. Since then, she\u2019s attended <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/07\/dc-council-street-vending-bill\/\">council hearings<\/a> and pushed for elected leaders to pass laws like the one that <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/04\/04\/dc-council-bill-street-vending\/\">overhauled street vending last year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany people are undocumented. They\u2019d like to vote or do something, but there is no opportunity. One can only listen or hear,\u201d says Diaz.<\/p>\n<p>When she first learned that the new law was in effect \u2013 and that <a href=\"https:\/\/surveyheart.com\/form\/65ae7fc663228478dc846db0\">local advocates were helping people<\/a> like her register to vote \u2013 Diaz says she had no choice but to attend the recent outing to the DCBOE\u2019s offices.<\/p>\n<p>Still, as first-timers, she and the others have questions for both the election workers and advocates when registering. Like what form of identification to use, whether they\u2019ll receive their ballots in the mail, if they too can serve as an election worker, and how to choose their party affiliation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the difference between those political parties?\u201d asks Diaz.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, what are the differences? Explain to her because I don\u2019t understand.

By doing so, they won\u2019t be able to vote in the upcoming primaries for Democrats or Republicans, for example, but they can update their registration online up to 21 days before the next election if they change their minds.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005121\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005121\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/voterreg5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Antonia Diaz, left, stands inside the lobby of the D.C.

She signs her name over and hands it back to the worker.<\/p>\n<p>Save for the commute to the DCBOE\u2019s office on Half Street SE, and waiting in a few lobbies, the task takes the group about an hour to get through. After a few more minutes to process their registration, one of the election workers returns to congratulate all three of the new voters.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a big moment for Ana and Genesis Lemus, who smile and take photos with their voter registration receipts. Lemus, another street vendor, was prompted into civic engagement following a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/19\/11\/21\/after-police-confront-teen-selling-food-on-the-sidewalk-activist-demand-protections-for-street-vendors\/\">2019 police confrontation with her daughter<\/a>. From there, the two have become leaders in their community and were regular voices in the push that decriminalized street vending without a license.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to make it so that the community comes out to vote,\u201d says Lemus. \u201cBecause our vote is important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For 19 year-old Genesis, being a registered voter could open up future opportunities for her to continue supporting her community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels exciting to be a registered voter now,\u201d says Lemus. \u201cI guess I\u2019m looking forward to maybe running one day for office \u2013 maybe ANC first \u2013 and now, I think being able to have the support of my community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Also there to congratulate them is Abel Amene, one of the advocates who organized the day\u2019s registration. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the election worker comes back with a registration receipt for Abel himself (who prefers to go by his first name due to his culture\u2019s patronymic naming system).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLook! I\u2019m a non-citizen voter just like you,\u201d says Abel, who was born in Ethiopia.<\/p>\n<p>As an immigrant, Abel is also a longtime advocate for <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/10\/04\/dc-council-non-citizens-mail-voting\/\">the effort to extend<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/31\/immigrants-and-their-advocates-lobby-d-c-council-to-support-and-fund-key-bills\/\"> implement voting rights<\/a> for non-citizens in the District. So late last year, when registration finally opened, Abel says he became the first non-citizen to register to vote. He also became <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/12\/16\/first-noncitizen-hold-office-dc\/\">the first non-citizen elected into public office in D.C<\/a> as the Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for 4D02 in Brightwood Park. It\u2019s a hyperlocal and voluntary post that was <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/08\/23\/dc-anc-hyperlocal-government\/\">created out of the Home Rule Act<\/a>, which gave D.C. residents the right to elect a mayor and council, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>So far, about 23 people total have registered to vote in D.C. as non-citizens, according to a spokesperson for the DCBOE. For Abel, it\u2019s not quite the 50,000 or so potential voters that advocates previously estimated, but is a hard-won number after <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/06\/10\/dc-council-bill-would-let-non-citizens-vote-in-local-elections\/\">years of failed bills<\/a> and recent efforts in Congress <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/01\/12\/congressional-gop-want-overturn-dc-bill-allowing-non-citizens-vote\/\">to overturn the bill<\/a> once it finally passed in D.C. Council.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005118\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5005118 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/voterreg1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">The group is among the first 23 residents to take advantage of a new law that expanded local voting rights to non-citizens in D.C. They can now register to vote and cast their ballot in future elections for mayor, council, attorney general, state board of education, and more. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">H\u00e9ctor Alejandro Arzate \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Last February, the Republican-led House of Representatives (in which delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton had no vote for the District\u2019s 700,000 residents) passed a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/02\/09\/gop-house-of-representatives-votes-overturn-two-dc-bills\/\">measure<\/a> to repeal the non-citizen voting law, with some arguing it would dilute the votes of citizens and potentially lead to foreign interference. In D.C., many called the move \u2013 which also sought to repeal a revision to <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/14\/how-congress-blocked-dc-criminal-code-bill\/\">D.C\u2019s criminal code<\/a> \u2013 an attempt to interfere in local affairs, a sentiment that some residents <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/24\/01\/31\/dc-home-rule-opponents-weaponize-crime\/\">have felt for years<\/a>. Former Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, warned his viewers that such a law would be a threat to the United States \u2013 though, with little mention of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/02\/27\/dc-non-citizen-voting-long-history-in-region\/\">the history of non-citizen voting, particularly in the D.C. region<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have tens of millions of illegal aliens\u2026 living in the United States, and our elections are determined by tens or hundreds of thousands of votes. So if they can all vote, we\u2019re done,\u201d said Carlson.<\/p>\n<p>The Senate, however, chose not to follow the House\u2019s move during the period of Congressional review. Ultimately, the bill to enfranchise non-citizens in D.C. became law, which Abel and its advocates say is a victory not just for immigrants but for the entirety of the District and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/24\/01\/29\/history-district-self-government-home-rule\/\">its 50-year-old right to semi self-governance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo giving them at least the right to vote in local elections is part of that whole idea of no taxation without representation,\u201d says Abel. \u201cD.C. residents, more than anyone, understand this, right? And more than that, we want to make D.C. a welcoming place for anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last July, Norton issued a <a href=\"https:\/\/norton.house.gov\/media\/press-releases\/norton-condemns-oversight-committee-marking-anti-home-rule-bill-would-overturn\">statement<\/a> condemning the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability for marking up another bill that sought to overturn the non-citizen voting law. She vowed to defeat the effort, calling it \u201canti-home rule.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, she too sees non-citizen voting as a victory.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the District is trying to do is to just make sure nobody in the District is left without some say in the local government. So it goes as far as it can go, short of statehood,\u201d Norton told DCist\/WAMU.<\/p>\n<p>Ward 1 Council member Brianne K. Nadeau, who introduced the bill and some of its previous iterations, says it was long overdue for longtime residents. She says many pay taxes and raise their children in local schools, and should have a say in the next election.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think if it\u2019s a good idea the first time, it\u2019s still going to be a good idea every subsequent time,\u201d says Nadeau. \u201cIt really hits home because in the District of Columbia, we already don\u2019t have a voice in our federal government. And so allowing for that participation locally can only strengthen our community and engagement and the outcomes of our elections.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5005120\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5005120\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2024\/02\/voterreg3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Registering to vote in local elections is a big moment for Ana and Genesis Lemus, left, who smile and take photos with their voter registration receipts. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">H\u00e9ctor Alejandro Arzate \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As far as the potential foreign interference that some opponents warned about the law, Nadeau says it \u201cseems like it\u2019s not coming to fruition,\u201d given how few people have registered so far. She also counters that there are other examples that should take priority for Congress, such as the Facebook ads that were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/09\/08\/549284183\/facebook-acknowledges-russian-ads-in-2016-election-will-investigations-follow\">purchased by foreign governments during the 2016 election<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re just not seeing the influx that those fear mongers said would come,\u201d says Nadeau.<\/p>\n<p>The voter registration form states that applicants must maintain residence in D.C. for at least 30 days prior to the election they\u2019re trying to vote in, which is true for both U.S citizens and non-citizens. It\u2019s also not allowed to claim voting residence or the right to vote in another U.S. state, territory, or country when registering to vote in D.C. Those who do \u201ccan be convicted and fined up to $10,000 and\/or jailed for up to five years,\u201d according to the DCBOE\u2019s online registration form.<\/p>\n<p>When asked if foreign interference was a concern, a representative for the DCBOE told DCist\/WAMU that \u201cthe Board is charged with enfranchising all eligible voters, including eligible non-citizens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other challenges to the law still remain, however. In May, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pacermonitor.com\/public\/case\/48741413\/HALL_et_al_v_DISTRICT_OF_COLUMBIA_BOARD_OF_ELECTIONS\">lawsuit<\/a> was filed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/05\/13\/dc-noncitizen-voting-lawsuit\/\">try to stop the implementation <\/a>of non-citizen voting. According to the DCBOE, the lawsuit is ongoing. The Immigration Reform Law Institute, which <a href=\"https:\/\/irli.org\/irli-d-c-candidate-for-mayor-defend-suit-to-stop-d-c-alien-voting-law\/\">represents the plaintiffs<\/a>, did not respond to an email request from DCist\/WAMU for comment.<\/p>\n<p>For now, advocates like Abel say the next steps should focus on voter outreach and to maintain registration accessibility for all non-citizens, regardless of their spoken language.<\/p>\n<p>The DCBOE says it will continue working towards a similar goal. In the fiscal year 2024 for D.C.\u2019s budget, the DCBOE says its allotted budget includes an overall increase of $1.483 million to support the implementation of the non-citizen voting law, which includes an earmark of $506,000 for outreach and education. As mandated by the <a href=\"https:\/\/ohr.dc.gov\/service\/know-your-rights-language-access\">Language Access Act<\/a>, both the online and in-person voter registration forms are now available in English, Amharic, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Applicants who use a language other than those seven can also have forms translated upon request, according to the DCBOE.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Abel says he wants to help \u201ca few hundred people\u201d get registered to vote.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that this will mean that the immigrant experience is considered in how laws are passed, in how agencies are administered, and that we give a voice to many of these issues \u2013 like street vendors, like excluded workers, like domestic workers. All predominantly immigrant communities,\u201d says Abel.<\/p>\n<p>Diaz, meanwhile, says \u201cit\u2019s a blessing for me to be able to participate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Jacob Fenston contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>23 people have registered to vote in D.C. as non-citizens.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

I have experienced what it means to be uninsured, housing and food insecure, evicted, dependent on public transportation, marginalized, and treated as if I did not speak English. Playing sports in high school and college and working in restaurants and public health taught me that everything is interconnected and the importance of teamwork. As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote. If re-elected I look forward to discussing the results of our initial study on the impacts of the new policies with the community.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes, I wrote and led the effort to continue and fund the current pilot program through the end of FY25 until we can consider a more permanent or expanded program in FY26. The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We made a significant investment in both the operating and capital budgets for ACPS in the FY25 budget allocating over $8 million in new revenue to ACPS out of $11.75 million in new revenue. In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

Working with staff, we go intersection-by-intersection, block-by-block working with neighbors to find solutions that keep everyone safe and moving. This experience has taught me about the unique character and individualized needs of each neighborhood as well as the importance of details.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes. In Alexandria and nationally, this program (called ARISE) has been proven to benefit families and foster economic growth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding. We need to leverage the unique opportunities available to AHRA and our industrial development authority because we cannot keep waiting for Richmond to fund these needed projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I believe Zoning for Housing was a step in the right direction but much more must be done. Nothing in Z4H ensures that developers build the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d workforce housing or affordable housing. It\u2019s imperative that members of Council use their votes on each and every project to ensure that each project benefits Alexandria and meets the needs of our community members.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Providing a quality education for every student must be a priority, as is retaining quality educators. When I look at the City budget, I am constantly reminded the local government is responsible for three major areas: public safety, infrastructure and education. We must do these things well because no other level of government can address them or provide the needed investments. Our schools must be fully funded.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#McPike\"><\/a>Kirk McPike<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049097\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049097\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Kirk McPike.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Kirk McPike campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kirk McPike is a current member of the City Council.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly?

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid.
