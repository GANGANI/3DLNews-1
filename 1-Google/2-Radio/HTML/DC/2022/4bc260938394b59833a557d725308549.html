primary wins, Alsobrooks, Hogan will go head-to-head for Maryland U.S. Senate seat","content":"<p><b><i>This story will be updated.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George&#8217;s County Executive, won a tight race for the Democratic nod for Maryland&#8217;s open U.S. Senate seat, defeating Rep. David Trone (D-MD-06). The Associated Press called the race at 10 p.m. Tuesday night.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s her second term at the helm in Prince George&#8217;s county, the second most populous county in Maryland. A win in November would be historic; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebaltimorebanner.com\/politics-power\/state-government\/alsobrooks-senate-win-election-black-women-JUAQ34FLSFAZXKAO245QKHARHU\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alsobrooks would be the first Black woman to represent Maryland in the Senate, and only the fourth Black woman ever in that chamber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On the Republican side, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan cruised to the nomination, setting up a highly competitive race in the fall.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They said the Hogan brand of politics was dead, but once again, we proved them wrong tonight,&#8221; Hogan told supporters Tuesday night. Hogan, who governed as a moderate, was popular across the state, but his departure from office &#8212; and the failure of his handpicked successor to subsequently win the Republican nomination over a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022 &#8212; had\u00a0 raised questions about the direction of the state GOP.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The general election field for Maryland\u2019s 6th congressional district is also set. Republican Neil Parrott, a former state delegate, is projected to have won his party&#8217;s nomination. On the Democratic side, April McClain Delaney, a former Biden administration official and the wife of Rep. John Delaney, who previously represented the seat, won the party nod.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All of Tuesday&#8217;s results are still unofficial. There are more mail-in and provisional ballots left to count. Maryland elections officials expect to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pwoodreporter\/status\/1790427798881878460\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">continue tallying mail-in ballots on Thursday<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and they\u2019ll complete their count of provisional ballots next week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As expected, Donald Trump and Joe Biden won the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries handily.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A small but significant percent of voters in the Democratic primary cast ballots as \u201cuncommitted,\u201d joining a growing nationwide movement expressing dissatisfaction with the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel and its war against Hamas, which is causing a mass humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/listentomaryland.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Listen to Maryland<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the group behind the state\u2019s \u201cuncommitted\u201d campaign, won the backing of several local unions and held a door-knocking campaign in advance of Election Day.

Trone, who owns the national alcohol retailer Total Wine &amp; More, has spent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/09\/maryland-senate-primary-trone-money\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">more than $60 million of his own money<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on the campaign and has outspent Alsobrooks ten to one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The race also became a battle of endorsements. Alsobrooks landed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2024\/04\/18\/endorsement-angela-alsobrooks-maryland-senate-democrats\/\">Washington Post editorial board\u2019s endorsement<\/a>, as well as a number of heavy hitters in Maryland politics, including Gov. Wes Moore, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Rep. Raskin, and Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones.\u00a0Trone notably received the endorsement of Maryland&#8217;s largest teachers union, as well the nod from national politicians, including U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Perhaps even more notably, several Prince George\u2019s County elected officials also backed Trone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Both campaigns have blanketed the state with television ads, some sparking backlash. One Trone ad in particular suggested the Prince George\u2019s County Executive would need \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcwashington.com\/decision-2024\/trone-campaign-faces-backlash-over-training-wheels-comment-about-primary-opponent-alsobrooks\/3608504\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">training wheels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201d if she were elected to the Senate (the ad was subsequently edited).

Under new district lines, Democrats have a several-point edge, even after the map was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2022\/03\/25\/maryland-congressional-map-thrown-out-gerrymandering\/\">adjusted<\/a> to be fairer to Republicans, but the district is still considered reasonably competitive.<\/p>\n<p>Delaney and Parrott triumphed over crowded fields in their respective primaries. Sixteen Democrats and seven Republicans appeared on the ballot, but there were signs that both races were narrowing, with several familiar faces pulling in the lion\u2019s share of money and attention towards the end of the race.<\/p>\n<p>Delaney and Parrott are two of those familiar faces. Delaney, a former official at the U.S. Department of Commerce, is also the wife of former Rep. John Delaney. Parrott, a former state delegate, was the Republican nominee for the seat in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>In the Democratic contest, Delaney held off <a href=\"https:\/\/moco360.media\/2024\/04\/29\/primary-election-2024-meet-joe-vogel-democratic-candidate-for-congressional-district-6\/\">Del. Joe Vogel<\/a>, who currently represents District 17 in the General Assembly and has extensive experience working on other Democratic political campaigns across the state.<\/p>\n<p>Both Democrats emphasized boosting economic opportunities for the district and support for protecting abortion rights. During the campaign, Delaney pitched herself as a common sense candidate ready to hit the ground running, and racked up support from several prominent Democrats, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marylandmatters.org\/2024\/04\/27\/political-notes-senate-ad-watch-hogan-at-the-border-plus-a-big-endorsement-in-cd-6\/\">including<\/a> Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD-08), Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD-05), and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. She also poured more than half a million dollars into her own race. Vogel, meanwhile, landed the endorsement of Maryland\u2019s largest teachers union, and said he\u2019d bring an important perspective to Congress as a gay, Latino, Gen-Z lawmaker, and tried to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/09\/maryland-sixth-primary-campaign-ads\/?utm_campaign=wp_afternoon_buzz&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_buzz&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3d5803f%2F6615a026d639aa0cc1b7a642%2F596c3218ade4e24119c6b519%2F16%2F44%2F6615a026d639aa0cc1b7a642\">attack<\/a> McClain Delaney for social connections to Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>On the Republican side, Parrott defeated former Del. Dan Cox, the Republican nominee for governor in 2022, who received the next-highest vote total. He also held off Navy veteran Tom Royals, a political newcomer who led the field in fundraising. Parrott and many of his fellow Republican candidates expressed support for conservative ideas like tougher border policy, cutbacks in the federal government, and concerns about liberal ideas in public schools.<\/p>\n<p>The results provide one clue as to the current direction of the Maryland GOP, which has been in question since Hogan departed the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 and then Cox, an election denier who was endorsed by Trump, <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/22\/07\/20\/trump-loyalist-dan-cox-wins-gop-governor-primary-maryland\/\">won an upset victory<\/a> over Hogan\u2019s handpicked successor, Kelly Schulz, in the 2022 Republican primary for governor.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Prince George&#8217;s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks beat three-term Congressman David Trone for the Democratic nomination in the Maryland Senate race.

plans","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It&#8217;s game over for the Northern Virginia arena \u2014 with the Washington Wizards and Capitals now poised to stay in the District.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The City of Alexandria <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/news-citywide\/2024-03-27\/city-of-alexandria-releases-statement-on-potomac-yard-entertainment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">announced<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Wednesday afternoon that it had &#8220;ended negotiations&#8221; on the development deal, which was anchored by a pro sports arena for D.C.\u2019s professional basketball and hockey teams in the Potomac Yard neighborhood.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">D.C. officials, for their part, announced the teams\u2019 intent to stay in the District later the same evening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That means the Wizards and the Capitals will stay in downtown D.C. \u2014 and they\u2019re likely to get a hefty $500 million from the District to upgrade the existing CapitalOne Arena along with their commitment to stay in the city until 2050.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson said the Council would vote on the funding package, which would come out of the District\u2019s capital budget, on Tuesday. Mendelson and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser took a victory lap at a press conference Wednesday night after Alexandria\u2019s announcement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe are going to be together for a long time,\u201d Bowser said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The D.C. deal also includes an agreement to add another 200,000 square feet of space to CapitalOne, 17 police officers patrolling the area during games, new practice facilities for the Wizards, and restrictions on street vendors and performers who frequent the area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Monumental CEO Ted Leonsis, who also spoke at the press conference, emphasized his good working relationship with Bowser, noting frequent meetings at the Waldorf hotel and open discussions about the company\u2019s concerns regarding crime and noise near CapitalOne and the Gallery Place-Chinatown\u2019s struggles to rebound from the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cD.C. did everything right from December on,\u201d Leonsis said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The relationship between Leonsis and D.C. officials hasn\u2019t been entirely rosy, however. Last week, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sent a letter to Monumental arguing that plans to move the teams to Virginia and extricate the company from its decadeslong lease would violate the terms of the original agreement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leonsis said he would rather not speak about why the Virginia deal fell through, but still issued a few barbs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cVirginia\u2019s kind of two states. It\u2019s Richmond and it\u2019s Northern Virginia, and they need to get together,\u201d he said. State Sen. L. Louise Lucas, a Portsmouth lawmaker who publicly opposed the deal and leads the Senate Finance committee \u2014 and therefore operates as a gatekeeper to the state\u2019s funds \u2014 is notably not from either area. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe negotiated a framework for this opportunity in good faith and participated in the process in Richmond in a way that preserved our integrity,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/news-citywide\/2024-03-27\/city-of-alexandria-releases-statement-on-potomac-yard-entertainment\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson stated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u201cWe trusted this process and are disappointed in what occurred between the Governor and General Assembly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This comes after lawmakers in Virginia\u2019s General Assembly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpm.org\/news\/2024-03-10\/general-assembly-approves-2-year-budget-without-arena\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">didn&#8217;t include plans for the arena<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in its state budget proposal, dealing a blow to the project championed by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to lure pro sports to Northern Virginia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In his statement, Wilson lamented that the proposal \u201cgot caught up in partisan warfare in Richmond,\u201d ultimately preventing Alexandria officials from fully considering the project themselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wilson and the Alexandria City Council expressed openness and general support for the arena concept, but have long insisted that the deal\u2019s details \u2014 including accompanying support for transportation infrastructure improvements in the area, affordable housing commitments, and project-labor agreements for construction and hospitality workers at the site \u2014 needed to be fleshed out before they could support it. They also criticized what they said was inadequate representation for Alexandria on the sports authority board, which would own the arena and issue the bonds to pay for its construction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Youngkin issued a statement in response to Wilson\u2019s announcement that &#8220;personal and political agendas&#8221; were to blame for the deal falling through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;A one-of-a-kind project bringing world-class athletes and entertainment, creating 30,000 jobs and $12 billion in economic activity just went up in smoke. This transformational project would have driven investment to every corner of the Commonwealth,\u201d Youngkin said in the news release. \u201cThis should have been our deal and our opportunity, all the General Assembly had to do was say: \u2018thank you, Monumental, for wanting to come to Virginia and create $12 billion of economic investment, let\u2019s work it out.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lucas celebrated the arena deal\u2019s end with a meme and a Bitmoji in two social media posts.

Louise Lucas (@SenLouiseLucas) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SenLouiseLucas\/status\/1773074064082440453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 27, 2024<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It took only 105 days for the avenues by which the $2 billion dollar proposal could have come to life to close off, one by one.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In December, Youngkin <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.governor.virginia.gov\/newsroom\/news-releases\/2023\/december\/name-1018886-en.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">announced the project<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which had been green-lit by a legislative commission, and then included it in his two-year budget proposal. General Assembly legislators put that proposal into stand-alone bills, which passed the Virginia House of Delegates, although with significant changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But in the Virginia Senate, state Sen. Louise Lucas (D\u2013Portsmouth) exercised her power as chair of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee to not hear the bill at all. When the House of Delegates version came to the chamber, Lucas kept it off the docket once more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At a March 7 press conference after a Legislature budget draft was proposed without the project, Youngkin said the deal was meeting a \u201csingle roadblock,\u201d alluding to Lucas, who was standing behind the governor throughout the conference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, when a Virginia state budget was passed later that week, it did not include the arena either. Youngkin could have reintroduced the proposal in budget amendments after the regular session ended earlier this month, but wouldn\u2019t say if he would \u2014 instead saying it was the Senate\u2019s \u201cmove\u201d at the March 7 press conference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other key Democrats were more supportive of discussing the proposal, and they blamed the deal\u2019s defeat on what they saw as the failure of the Youngkin administration to effectively work with the Legislature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI hope this is a wake up call for his administration so that Virginia is not left falling behind on economic development opportunities because he is unwilling to work with the legislative majorities voters put in place in November,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D\u2013Fairfax), who carried that chamber\u2019s legislation, in a statement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back in November, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/11\/30\/capital-one-arena-revitalize-downtown\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">preliminary designs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were shared with WAMU about what a revamped CapitalOne Arena could look like.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the goals would be to create better \u201csightlines\u201d for those walking by on F Street to see what\u2019s happening inside the arena, according to a source with knowledge of the potential renovation plans. That would mea all-glass building corners and large egresses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Entrances and exits would be bigger and more accessible to allow for better traffic flow in and out of the arena, often an issue during crowded events. There could also be a public food court that would be open and available during regular business hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new arena project drew <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/24\/02\/01\/alexandria-city-officials-tout-arena-deal-residents-protest\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sustained community opposition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> from Alexandria residents concerned about traffic, noise, public safety, and the idea of taxpayer subsidies for Ted Leonsis, the teams\u2019 billionaire sports owner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen we looked more deeply at the financial cost, we thought, \u2018Why in God&#8217;s name should we taxpayers be the credit card for this, for this project?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Macdonald, co-founder of the Coalition to Stop the Arena, in an interview with WAMU earlier in the week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But city leaders and some residents wanted to give the project a chance, seeing it as a possible catalyst for new commercial tax revenue even as office vacancies around Northern Virginia skyrocket. Compared to its neighbors in Arlington and Fairfax counties, Alexandria has a relatively weak commercial tax base, forcing it to rely heavily on residential taxpayers to keep up its services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe&#8217;ve been saying for years that, you know, we have this structural imbalance and we were gonna have to deal with it,\u201d Wilson told WAMU last week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alexandria\u2019s mayor also predicted the arena \u2014 and the community debates it touched off about growth and development \u2014 are likely to be front-and-center issues in June primary elections for Alexandria\u2019s city council and its next mayor. (Wilson is not running for re-election.)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The death of the arena deal punts the question of what new development will go in Potomac Yard, a prime location next to a new Metro station. The city\u2019s plan for the area envisions dense mixed-use development, but the site is currently occupied by a Target, other big-box retail, and parking lots.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alexandria will \u201cinstead turn our focus to other efforts to bring quality commercial opportunities to the community in the future, to both diversify our tax base and protect our quality of life,\u201d Wilson said in his Wednesday statement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>VPM News Managing Editor Dawnthea M.

of Virginia General Assembly","content":"<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This post will be updated as more results come in.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>Virginia Democrats swept to victory in the state\u2019s hard-fought legislative election on Tuesday night, keeping control of the state Senate and flipping the House of Delegates. The results are a major blow to Gov. Glenn Younkin, who campaigned hard for a Republican \u201ctrifecta\u201d in Richmond.<\/p>\n<p>In the new legislative session in January, the party will now have a two seat-margin in the senate and a still-undetermined margin in the House of Delegates.<\/p>\n<p>In Northern Virginia, Democrats won most of the handful of battleground seats in the outer suburbs and exurbs of western Prince William and Loudoun counties, solidifying the increasingly blue tilt of those areas.<\/p>\n<p>That includes the closely-watched state Senate race in Loudoun County, where Democrat Russet Perry defeated Republican Juan Pablo Segura <a href=\"https:\/\/enr.elections.virginia.gov\/results\/public\/Virginia\/elections\/2023-Nov-Gen\/ballot-items\/10792127-c3ca-41d0-a152-e66b3d3fc5a8\">by a roughly 5-point margin<\/a>. In a neighboring district in Prince William County, Democrat Del. Danica Roem also <a href=\"https:\/\/enr.elections.virginia.gov\/results\/public\/Virginia\/elections\/2023-Nov-Gen\/ballot-items\/0ed067b2-f040-4c53-b976-e646c866adda\">came out on top<\/a>, beating Republican Bill Woolf for a state Senate seat in the 30th District. And in House District 21, Democrat Josh Thomas held off Republican John Stirrup <a href=\"https:\/\/enr.elections.virginia.gov\/results\/public\/Virginia\/elections\/2023-Nov-Gen\/ballot-items\/40aeb31d-d847-4ab0-b94f-fa52a1fbfba8\">by three percentage points<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The results are a reversal from the party\u2019s losses two years ago, when Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, pulled off a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/11\/03\/glenn-youngkin-wins-virginia-election\/\">narrow upset in the gubernatorial race<\/a> and helped Republicans recapture the House of Delegates.<\/p>\n<p>David Rexrode, the chairman of Youngkin\u2019s political action committee, acknowledged Republicans fell short of their ambitions on election night.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are still monitoring a couple key races and will fully assess where things stand in the morning,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DRexrode\/status\/1722107603545620834\">he posted on X<\/a>. \u201cWe had hoped for a stronger outcome this evening but are proud of the effort all of our candidates put in to these extremely competitive districts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the past two years, divided control of the General Assembly has meant only the most bipartisan legislation made it to Youngkin\u2019s desk. Now, with Democrats narrowly in charge of both chambers, Youngkin could be forced to directly veto a raft of Democratic bills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou can expect more gridlock,\u201d says Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington. \u201cThe reality of politics is when there\u2019s a divided government is that not that much gets done.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Implications for 2024<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>On the campaign trail, Virginia Democrats focused their message on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginiamercury.com\/2023\/10\/26\/virginia-abortion-battle-could-come-down-to-how-voters-feel-about-the-word-ban\/\">abortion rights<\/a>, pointing to Virginia\u2019s status as the last state in the South to not restrict the procedure after the Dobbs decision. Currently, the procedure is legal through the second trimester of pregnancy, and after that if three doctors agree that the pregnancy is a serious health risk. Democratic candidates ran on keeping Virginia\u2019s abortion laws the same, and hammered Republicans for their support of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/10\/25\/youngkin-abortion-15-week-elections\/\">15-week restriction<\/a>, with certain exceptions. (Some Republicans, including Youngkin, have told supporters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/08\/10\/abortion-ban-virginia-elections-stirrup\/\">they\u2019d like to go further<\/a>, an inconsistency which quickly became another Democratic talking point.)<\/p>\n<p>Republicans, meanwhile, attempted to ride the general popularity of Gov. Glenn Youngkin to victory, emphasizing <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/11\/03\/how-will-parents-rights-play-in-virginia-elections\/\">parents\u2019 rights<\/a> and concerns about crime.<\/p>\n<p>While the highest office on the ballot on Tuesday was state Senator, it was far from a sleepy election campaign, with the national political class eyeing the race as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2023\/11\/06\/1210793753\/what-virginias-legislative-elections-could-spell-for-2024-on-abortion-rights\">proving ground for messaging in the 2024 presidential race<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf it works this year in Virginia, then it becomes an issue that other states and national candidates can use next year,\u201d said David Ramadan, a former Republican Delegate and current professor of practice at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy. \u201cIf it does not work this year in Virginia, then it\u2019s not something that they\u2019re going to use. And that works on both sides, Democrats and Republicans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The results may also have implications for Youngkin\u2019s political future. The popular Virginia governor has attempted to build a national profile, campaigning for Republican candidates across the country and pulling in support from major GOP donors. Those activities have sparked rampant speculation about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-11-07\/will-glenn-youngkin-run-for-president-2024-virginia-elections-a-key-test\">Youngkin\u2019s possible presidential ambitions<\/a> \u2014 speculation he has mostly deflected by saying he\u2019s focused on winning a Republican trifecta in Richmond. His political action committee poured $14.4 million into achieving that outcome this year, but ultimately fell short.<\/p>\n<p>In the absence of a major Republican victory in Tuesday\u2019s election, Youngkin\u2019s case for the presidency \u2014 or for national office generally \u2014 is a far harder one to make.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt definitely kills any potential for him nationally,\u201d said Ramadan.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Democrats hold two key state Senate seats<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The local race that garnered perhaps the most attention was for the state Senate seat in District 31, encompassing Loudoun and Fauquier counties. It pitted two first time candidates, former CIA officer and county prosecutor Russet Perry, a Democrat, against <a href=\"https:\/\/business.catholic.edu\/news\/2020\/01\/ceo-lecture-juan-pablo-segura.html\">local entrepreneur<\/a> Juan Pablo Segura, a Republican. Perry defeated Segura handily <a href=\"https:\/\/enr.elections.virginia.gov\/results\/public\/Virginia\/elections\/2023-Nov-Gen\/ballot-items\/10792127-c3ca-41d0-a152-e66b3d3fc5a8\">by a five percent margin<\/a>. It was a result that <a href=\"https:\/\/cnalysis.com\/articles\/our-final-virginia-2023-ratings\/#google_vignette\">wasn\u2019t unexpected<\/a>, but still exemplifies how the rest of the night went in the Commonwealth.<\/p>\n<p>Abortion rights, crime, and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/11\/03\/how-will-parents-rights-play-in-virginia-elections\/\">parents\u2019 rights<\/a>\u201d were the main themes of that race, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginiamercury.com\/2023\/10\/31\/four-takeaways-from-the-last-campaign-finance-reports-of-virginias-2023-elections\/\">millions of dollars poured in<\/a> from state parties and advocacy groups, making it the most expensive race this election cycle. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/political-ads\/election-10358\/\">$6.4 million dollars<\/a> combined were spent on ads that have continuously been airing throughout the region for weeks, including ads painting Perry as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MXlg5JLq0F8&amp;t=1s\">soft on crime<\/a> and others calling Segura <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nKYBNUByFq8\">too extreme<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Due to this attention and spending, voter turnout was high. About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/visuals\/visual\/early-voting-ballots-returned\/\">32,000 votes<\/a> were cast early in a district the Virginia Public Access Project called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/elections\/senate\/vpap-index\/\">\u201ccompetitive<\/a>.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/11\/01\/virginia-early-voting-election-day-prince-william-county\/\">Youngkin\u2019s push for Republicans to vote early<\/a> did appear to work to a degree, with the share of in-person early votes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/visuals\/visual\/early-voting-by-party-11-2-2023\/\">shifting by about 3%<\/a> to likely Republicans compared to the gubernatorial race two years ago<strong>. <\/strong>Ultimately, Democrats still made up about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/visuals\/visual\/early-voting-by-party-11-2-2023\/\">53% of the early vote<\/a> across the state.<\/p>\n<p>In the other defining state Senate race in the region, state Delegate Danica Roem got a promotion to the upper chamber by beating former Fairfax County police officer (and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/09\/28\/virginia-senate-detective-bill-woolf\/\">one-time Trump appointee<\/a>) Bill Woolf, despite Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin <a href=\"https:\/\/wjla.com\/news\/local\/election-day-youngkin-moore-campaign-virginia-state-senate-candidates-tara-durant-bill-woolf-juan-pablo-segura-danica-roem-josh-thomas-guide-polls-ballot-democrat-virginia-races\">campaigning for him<\/a> in recent weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Roem defeated Woolf by <a href=\"https:\/\/enr.elections.virginia.gov\/results\/public\/Virginia\/elections\/2023-Nov-Gen\/ballot-items\/0ed067b2-f040-4c53-b976-e646c866adda\">more than 3 percentage points<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Abortion rights as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/09\/01\/northern-virginia-data-center-report\/\">data centers<\/a> were the focus of both candidates in this race. Roem and Woolf stuck to their respective parties\u2019 messages, with Roem saying she would <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/06\/28\/future-of-abortion-in-virginia-after-roe-dobbs\/\">keep the current state laws as is<\/a> and would push to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princewilliamtimes.com\/news\/roem-woolf-spar-on-abortion-data-centers-va-28-bypass-in-first-debate\/article_de19d49c-5fb0-11ee-9d30-a7296a2df18e.html\">add the right to an abortion to the state constitution<\/a>. Virginia is currently the only Southern state to not ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy or earlier.<\/p>\n<p>Woolf said that he would have supported a Youngkin backed-proposal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/local\/richmond\/2023\/10\/03\/virginia-abortion-ban-glenn-youngkin\">restricting abortion after 15 weeks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While both candidates have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princewilliamtimes.com\/news\/roem-woolf-spar-on-abortion-data-centers-va-28-bypass-in-first-debate\/article_de19d49c-5fb0-11ee-9d30-a7296a2df18e.html\">publicly opposed<\/a> the Prince William Digital Gateway project, Woolf questioned why Roem hasn\u2019t pressed local Democrats who support the project, highlighting the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/07\/27\/as-an-example-of-the-prosperity-data-center-revenue-can-create\/\">divide<\/a> among Democrats on the issue.

Puedes leer este art\u00edculo en espa\u00f1ol <a href=\"https:\/\/eltiempolatino.com\/2023\/11\/01\/noticias-locales\/dc-dmv\/votacion-temprana-en-el-norte-de-virginia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aqu\u00ed<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It may be an off-off-year election, but Virginians are voting early in solid numbers in an election that will determine control of both chambers in the closely-divided state legislature. The outcome could have significant implications for abortion access, education policy, voting rights, and energy and climate policy in the commonwealth.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to many high-profile Republicans in recent years, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has been urging Republicans to vote early, and while Democrats won in\u00a0early voting turnout in recent years, Youngkin\u2019s message may be working.<\/p>\n<p>More than half a million Virginians <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/elections\/early-voting\/2023-november-general-election\/\">have voted so far<\/a>, with Monday seeing the highest single-day turnout so far, at over 30,000 in-person and absentee ballots. That\u2019s roughly half of all the early votes cast early during the governor\u2019s race in 2021, a highly competitive top-of-the-ticket contest. And some of the busiest days of early voting\u00a0come in the final week.<\/p>\n<p>Democrats for their part are banking on Virginia voters\u2019 overall support for maintaining abortion rights to turn out voters and keep control of the Senate and perhaps win the House. Republicans are focused on parental rights and crime in their attempt to hold the House and win the Senate. At least, that\u2019s the popular narrative among political watchers.<\/p>\n<p>In Northern Virginia, turnout is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vpap.org\/visuals\/visual\/early-voting-ballots-returned\/\">especially robust<\/a> in Prince William and Loudoun counties, which are home to the most competitive legislative races in the region.<\/p>\n<p>There, Democrats hope to hold or make further inroads in the exurban and rural areas of both counties, which have shifted from reliably red to increasingly blue in recent years. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to leverage Youngkin\u2019s popularity, whose 2021 victory came in part because he outright won or narrowed GOP losses in those areas.<\/p>\n<p>That was the context as candidates, volunteers and voters of both parties turned out for rallies and canvassing on Saturday in the Manassas area.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Democrats focus on abortion, quality of life issues<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>At around 11 a.m. on Saturday morning, Josh Thomas, the Democratic candidate for House District 21, was knocking on doors in a small neighborhood of townhomes off Route 234.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy sense is it\u2019s going to be close, but I\u2019m feeling good about it,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>With Thomas was Del. Dan Helmer, who represents the current HD-40 and is the Virginia House Democratic Caucus campaign chair. Helmer originally flipped parts of what is now HD-21 from red to blue in 2019. Democrats hope Thomas will help them further consolidate their hold in western Prince William County \u2014 and retake the House of Delegates.<\/p>\n<p>A victory for Thomas, Helmer says, is \u201cincredibly important\u201d to that wider goal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe is exactly the right person to represent this district,\u201d says Helmer. \u201cAnd his doing so is a critical component about whether or not women will have access to safe and legal abortion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many believe Democrats\u2019 road to victory next week \u2014 and potentially in 2024 \u2014 will be powered by the party\u2019s stance on protecting abortion rights, which for Virginia Democrats is pretty simple: keep <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/06\/28\/future-of-abortion-in-virginia-after-roe-dobbs\/\">the existing state laws<\/a> the same. That would mean the procedure stays legal through the second trimester of pregnancy, and after that if the pregnancy becomes a serious health risk and multiple doctors agree that it\u2019s necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Youngkin and Republican candidates around the state are pushing for a 15-week restriction on the procedure, which they say is a reasonable consensus position on a fraught issue. But they\u2019ve been hampered in making that case after several prominent Republicans \u2014 including Youngkin himself and Thomas\u2019 opponent, John Stirrup \u2014 were caught on tape vowing to support more aggressive restrictions on abortion access. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/10\/20\/abortion-virginia-election-poll-youngkin-approval\/\">Multiple<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/cnu.edu\/wasoncenter\/surveys\/archive\/2023-10-17.html\">polls<\/a> suggest Virginia voters, like most Americans, don\u2019t especially like the idea of rolling back abortion rights.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4999597\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4999597 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/10\/IMG_4579.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Rep. Abigail Spanberger speaks to Democratic volunteers in Manassas, with Thomas, Helmer, and Roem looking on. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Margaret Barthel \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But despite all that, Thomas\u2019 pitch to voters in Manassas on Saturday doesn\u2019t always put abortion front and center. At one door \u2014 which he\u2019s already knocked on twice in the last several months \u2014 Thomas focuses on cost-of-living issues and worries about public safety.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for all those things like affordability, lower crime, and certainly appreciate and hope to earn your vote this year,\u201d he says, while a dog tangles its leash around his ankles. He says he got into the race after watching neighbors struggle to avoid eviction after the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas briefly touches on his position on abortion \u2014 \u201cI stand on keeping the laws where they are right now\u201d \u2014 but only after he\u2019s asked about it.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas says that isn\u2019t unusual, at least for the doors he\u2019s assigned to knock, which are mostly for voters his campaign believes may be persuadable. With them, he says the primary issue is public education, followed by concerns about data center development \u2014 a hot-button issue that has <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/07\/27\/as-an-example-of-the-prosperity-data-center-revenue-can-create\/\">consumed county politics<\/a> \u2014 and maybe abortion after that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to independents, and I don\u2019t think it is necessarily number one or two on the minds of the average independent where I live. But it does come up,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>But even if he\u2019s talking about abortion less than overarching Democratic rhetoric would lead you to believe, Thomas still believes the issue will be a key one<strong>, <\/strong>even if not the only one, in determining the swing of the election, particularly by turning out the Democratic base.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo is it what is going to activate a lot of people to vote? Yes,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it probably one of the top two reasons converts from the Republican side vote for Democrats? Yes. And even with independent voters, it\u2019s probably two or three.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo issue is that consistent across all those different groups,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n<p>Other Democratic candidates in the Manassas area also appear to be walking a similar line. Later in the morning, Thomas and Helmer stopped by a canvass launch event for Thomas and Del. Danica Roem, who\u2019s currently seeking a promotion to the Virginia Senate in District 30, which overlaps with HD-21. About two dozen people are gathered in the back of Roem\u2019s campaign headquarters along Route 28, most in bright red Moms Demand Action shirts representing the gun control group.<\/p>\n<p>Helmer opened the event by hitting on Democratic talking points on abortion, emphasizing that Virginia is the last state in the South not to restrict the procedure after the Dobbs decision.<\/p>\n<p>But Roem has a much more local message on her mind. In her speech to volunteers, Roem focuses almost entirely on her campaign slogan, which is \u201cFixing Roads, Feeding Kids,\u201d a nod to her work on alleviating traffic congestion and ending childhood hunger in Virginia. She wants volunteers to talk up her record advocating for universal free school meals and trying to make Route 28 safer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m spending my campaign focused on fixing roads, feeding kids, protecting our land, instead of gutting your civil rights,\u201d she says, in response to a question about abortion in her race in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me try to take away your civil rights.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That focus on quality-of-life issues was how Roem, the first openly transgender legislator in the commonwealth, ousted a 13-term conservative Republican in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Rep. Abigail Spanberger (VA-07), a veteran of three razor-thin congressional contests in Virginia and a potential nominee for governor, also stopped by to fire up the canvassers. Asked about the role of abortion in powering a potential Democratic victory on Election Night, she echoed Thomas and Roem.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it will have played a factor across the board, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only factor,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Youngkin\u2019s early voting pitch<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>About an hour later and two miles away also in Manassas, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin joined several Republican candidates onstage to make their plea to voters to get to the polls early.<\/p>\n<p>Since early last month, Youngkin has embarked on a <a href=\"https:\/\/glennyoungkin.org\/youngkin-launches-secure-your-vote-virginia-bus-tour-ahead-of-2023-elections\">bus tour<\/a> to encourage Republicans to vote early and absentee. It appears to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princewilliamtimes.com\/news\/prince-william-fauquier-counties-lead-va-in-early-voting\/article_5bc320ce-5720-5189-9cf7-bec19c0f37f1.html\">working<\/a>, particularly in the hotly contested Prince William and Loudoun Counties.<\/p>\n<p>The strategy is a departure from national Republican messaging in previous years when former President Donald Trump and other high-profile conservatives cast doubt on the security of early voting and urged people to vote in person on election day. Even within the past two weeks, Trump had some<a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/campaign\/4273796-youngkin-dismisses-trump-early-voting-comments-every-single-vote-matters\/\"> mixed messaging<\/a> on voting early. But Youngkin embraced early voting back to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/10\/21\/us\/politics\/glenn-youngkin-early-voting-virginia.html\">his 2021<\/a> campaign, and has continuously credited the push for helping him to secure the governorship two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday afternoon saw the bus make a stop at Virginia State Senate candidate <a href=\"https:\/\/glennyoungkin.org\/event\/prince-william-secure-your-vote-rally\">Bill Woolf\u2019s campaign headquarters<\/a> at a shopping center in Manassas.<\/p>\n<p>After quick speeches from a number of other Republican candidates, including Wolfe, who is running against Virginia Delegate Danica Roem for the state Senate seat in District 30, Youngkin appeared on stage to raucous cheering and the musical stylings of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W2msh0jut2Y\">Norman Greenbaum\u2019s \u201cSpirit in the Sky<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Youngkin asked the crowd who had voted early and was greeted with lots of raised hands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor those who do not have your hand up, go, go, go, go vote!\u201d Youngkin yelled. \u201cWhen Republicans vote, Republicans win!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Virginia Governor leaped into a speech focused on supporting the Republican ticket in Prince William County and by-now common refrains like parents\u2019 rights, supporting law enforcement, job growth, and tax relief. He did not mention his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/10\/25\/youngkin-abortion-15-week-elections\/\">proposed 15-week abortion restriction.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Afterward, he spent time talking, taking photos, and asking people if they had voted yet.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst this gaggle of supporters, Youngkin told DCist\/WAMU that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.elections.virginia.gov\/resultsreports\/registrationturnout-statistics\/\"> low voter turnout<\/a> during last year\u2019s midterms, particularly compared to the 2020 and 2021 elections, still haunts him.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of being down thousands of votes when we go into these elections,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we work so hard to tell everybody, listen, the rules are the rules. Let\u2019s go win, let\u2019s compete.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Youngkin\u2019s push did encourage a number of those at the rally to do something they rarely do: Vote early.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI usually vote on November 7,\u201d Prince William County voter Matt told DCist\/WAMU. He declined to provide his last name. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff that came in the mail that said \u2018Get out there and vote early.\u2019 And, so, I basically looked up where to do it and did it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said the top concerns for him are crime and school policies.<\/p>\n<p>Liz Dordal, who lives in Prince William County, said she likes the convenience and ease of voting early. The main issue she\u2019s voting on is immigration, saying as a Mexican-American she believes people \u201cshould have to wait their turn and they should have to do it the right way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She thinks the governor\u2019s push is working, with many of her friends voting prior to Election Day for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are getting the word that \u2018hey, you don\u2019t have to wait till the very last minute,\u2019 Dordal said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been in elections where I waited till that day. I had the time to wait, but we had people who were waiting for hours in the morning before they went to work. So, to me, if it\u2019s a really important election, I think you should try to go out early.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4999596\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4999596\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/10\/IMG_0593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1260\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Youngkin and state senate candidate Bill Woolf, at left, with supporters at a \u201cSecure Your Vote\u201d rally in Manassas. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Matt Blitz \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Despite Youngkin\u2019s stance, some still want to vote on Election Day. Prince William County resident Pat Gorman, whose primary issue is abortion, said he plans to vote on November 7th.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would prefer that everybody voted on one day. I mean, that\u2019s how it\u2019s always traditionally worked and seems to be a lot simpler that way and a lot less confusion and things of that nature, you know,\u201d Gorman.<\/p>\n<p>Gorman said that this is partially related to his belief that Virginia\u2019s elections are \u201cnot 100%\u201d safe and secure. He provided an anecdote about how his son voted early last year, but his vote wasn\u2019t counted due to him not being registered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, no, not really. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re all that safe. But we are keeping a closer eye on it this year, hopefully,\u201d Gorman said.<\/p>\n<p>Other voters DCist\/WAMU spoke to, including those who did vote early, also expressed some mistrust in Virginia\u2019s election process. One voter said that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of a shadow of doubt,\u201d while two other voters said they \u201cpray\u201d the elections are safe and secure. Several shared stories of some perceived mix-up they witnessed at the polls that either prevented a registered voter from voting or allowed a non-registered resident to vote.<\/p>\n<p>For his part, Youngkin reiterated his belief that Virginia\u2019s elections are sound, but he also subtly cast doubt on the process nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think our elections are safe and secure. It\u2019s all paper ballots. We do not have voting machines. We have counting machines,\u201d Youngkin told DCist\/WAMU. \u201cAnd we can run an audit on any precinct or any voting area if people have questions. And so, yeah, they\u2019re safe and secure.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A detailed breakdown of early and absentee voting won\u2019t be known until after Election Day. So while it may take time to assess the impact of Democrat messaging on abortion and the Republican push for early voting, the outcome is likely to be closely watched nationally by both parties going into 2024.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated with the correct number of congressional races Rep.

singers prepare for baseball season","content":"<p>With Major League Baseball\u2019s Opening Day here, Nationals players and fans aren\u2019t the only ones eagerly waiting for baseball\u2019s return. The team\u2019s cadre of national anthem singers has also been preparing all winter long.<\/p>\n<p>That includes D.C. Washington, who on weekends can be found practicing his pipes in the church choir. \u201cI sing in the back row,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just another choir member.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But on Thursday at Nationals Park, Washington will be front and center <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NationalsPark\/status\/1636736649643315203\">performing the national anthem<\/a> at the team\u2019s Opening Day. Though he can be modest, Washington is one of the District\u2019s most prolific anthem singers.<\/p>\n<p>And, yes, that\u2019s his real name.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s short for Dwight Clyde Washington, and it provides perfect symmetry for someone who sings at some of D.C.\u2019s biggest sporting events. The Army veteran has sung at football games, soccer matches, basketball games \u2014 even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/video\/d-c-washington-performs-anthem\">Game 3 of the 2019 World Series<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Washington estimates he has performed the anthem at Nats Park about 60 times. Despite all those \u201crockets\u2019 red glares,\u201d he still gets nervous about messing up or forgetting the words.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I did my first [anthem] at FedEx Field, for three weeks, I would go over and over and over the words,\u201d Washington says. \u201cAnd every time I messed up, I would think, \u2018that\u2019s my ESPN moment\u2019 because the only time the anthem singer gets on ESPN is when he screwed up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Washington is one of about ten performers in the Nationals Park rotation, but the team is always looking for more. It is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/nationals\/fans\/anthem\">currently taking submissions<\/a> from national anthem hopefuls and will continue to do so throughout the season. The team has gotten about 150 submissions so far, a spokesperson said. The hope is to find 15 to 20 new performers that can be part of the Nats\u2019 rotation for years to come.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Washington has advice for all those rookies: first, always bring a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pitch_pipe\">pitch pipe.<\/a> Second: internalize the song\u2019s complicated rhyming scheme.<\/p>\n<p>For example: \u201c\u2018Oh, say can you see, by the dawn\u2019s early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight\u2019s last gleaming.\u2019 There\u2019s no rhyme there,\u201d Washington says. \u201c\u2018Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O\u2019er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.\u2019 All that rhymes with the very first part. That\u2019s where the rhyming takes place\u2026 That may not bother anybody else, but it can throw me off.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bob McDonald is another one of the city\u2019s most famed national anthem performers. He agrees that the rhyme scheme can be tricky, but what throws him more is the song\u2019s range.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big, large range \u2026 it\u2019s two octaves,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just a matter of preparing and making sure my voice is warmed up and [I am able to go] low and high. It\u2019s rangy, it\u2019s a tough song.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>McDonald is also an Army veteran and has sung at the World Series, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y3S0022lGPA\">Stanley Cup finals<\/a>, and even the Super Bowl. McDonald estimates he\u2019s performed the anthem hundreds of times across the D.C. area, including for the last <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhl.com\/capitals\/news\/anthem-singer-bob-mcdonald-retires-from-service-but-not-from-the-caps\/c-319607110\">three decades for the Washington Capitals<\/a>. He\u2019ll again be singing at Nats Park later this season.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4983098\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4983098 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/Bob_WorldSeries.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"627\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Bob McDonald has been performing the national anthem at D.C. sporting events for three decades. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Bob McDonald \/ Bob McDonald<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But, like Washington, all that experience doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not constantly practicing and running through the song. He typically gets to a game two hours early, so there\u2019s time to do a few run-throughs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think getting there early is a big part of my routine just to be calm and warming up a little bit \u2026 just singing through it,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of bathrooms in the bowels of Nats Park and Capital One Arena that have the best acoustics in the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>McDonald\u2019s advice for others who want to sing the anthem on the biggest of stages \u2014 sing wherever you can. That could be in church choirs, rock bands, or in his case, by performing in his other love: musical theater.\u00a0He\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dctheaterarts.org\/2015\/04\/01\/ticket-giveaway-bob-mcdonald-am-april42015\/\">performed in cabaret shows<\/a> around the region, and this spring, will appear in\u00a0Arlington\u2019s Signature Theater\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sigtheatre.org\/events\/202223\/sweeney-todd\/\">production of Sweeney Todd<\/a>. (He\u2019s part of the ensemble and the understudy for the title role.)<\/p>\n<p>Pete Subsara, the Nats\u2019 head of game presentation, emphatically agrees with McDonald\u2019s practice, practice, practice insight. Subsara picks the stadium\u2019s national anthem singers, and he\u2019s the one going through all those auditions from would-be performers.<\/p>\n<p>Subsara loves a singer that\u2019s experienced, powerful, and unique. It\u2019s also a home run when a saxophone, trumpet, or even an electric guitar gets involved.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve listened to hundreds and hundreds of anthems. And I always love hearing instruments play the anthem,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a unique sound that reverberates throughout the ballpark.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Subsara is preparing to pick some new voices to join the ranks of anthem singers, Washington and McDonald are co-aces of that rotation and for a good reason. They both see themselves as stewards of the song instead of being the center of attention.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fast. There\u2019s not a whole lot of frills, and I\u2019m gone,\u201d Washington says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. I count it as a privilege.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>McDonald had something similar to say. \u201cI learned early on that the secret was to just get it over with,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to do it without making it about yourself and to make it about the country. As former Army, [I\u2019m] thinking about some of the people I served with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They both say they perform the anthem in about a minute and twenty seconds, far shorter than many Super Bowl anthems that clock in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/music\/2023\/02\/12\/chris-stapleton-2023-super-bowl-national-anthem-length\/11242187002\/\">at nearly two minutes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Though the anthem\u2019s lyrics obviously carry a lot of weight for both men<strong>,<\/strong> McDonald says it\u2019s often the two words that come after the national anthem\u2019s last verse that usually gets the biggest ovation of all from fans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully, you sing along, and you have your hand over your heart,\u201d he says, \u201cand you yell, \u2018play ball\u2019 at the end.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Nationals Park&#8217;s national anthem singers spend the off-season keeping their voices limber for a new season of rockets&#8217; red glare.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/23\/03\/30\/national-anthem-singers-prep-for-opening-day\/","currentSlug":"national-anthem-singers-prep-for-opening-day","created":"2023-03-30T10:57:49","modified":"2023-03-30T10:57:49","time":"Mar 30, 2023","timestamp":1680173869,"timestampGMT":1680188269,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>D.C.

way","content":"<p>Longtime D.C. restaurant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebbitt.com\/\">Old Ebbitt Grill<\/a> is expanding for the first time and more locations of the new spot, to be dubbed Ebbitt House, could follow.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clydes.com\/\">Clyde\u2019s<\/a> which owns Old Ebbitt, the city\u2019s oldest restaurant, is planning to open a spinoff called Ebbitt House in Reston in 2025. The Reston Station restaurant will be a \u201csuburban\u201d version of the flagship located adjacent to the White House on 15th Street NW.<\/p>\n<p>The inaugural Ebbitt House is set to have 300 seats indoors plus two bars and 125 seats outdoors on a patio with an additional bar. The menu, while still being firmed up, will be similar to Old Ebbitt Grill, which serves steaks, seafood, American classics, and has a raw bar.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a return to Reston for Clyde\u2019s, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/washington\/news\/2022\/02\/09\/clydes-to-shutter-in-reston-but-may-open-nearby.html\">closed its location<\/a> at Reston Town Center nearly a year ago after three decades in that location. The Georgetown, Gallery Place, Alexandria, and Chevy Chase restaurants remain open.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Owens, Clyde\u2019s Restaurant Group\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, told DCist\/WAMU that the Reston restaurant is a model that could be replicated in other markets. The reason for the new name? It\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/digdc.dclibrary.org\/islandora\/object\/dcplislandora%3A101281?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=6a6a84db6a26c1b41fb8&amp;solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=2&amp;solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=17\">original name<\/a> of Old Ebbitt Grill. Plus, Old Ebbitt is, essentially, one-of-a-kind.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we could just choose a suburban location somewhere and have another Old Ebbitt Grill. Just because of the architecture, history, and decor of the original,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right to duplicate that in a different setting. So, we basically came up with this kind of suburban version.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For one, Ebbitt House will be located on the ground floor of a <a href=\"https:\/\/restonstation.com\/\">modern mixed-use building<\/a> with apartments stacked on top. That\u2019s far different than the original\u2019s location at 675 15th Street NW, a Beaux-Arts building that once was <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Keith%27s_Theater_LCCN2016822821.jpg\">the site of B. F. Keith\u2019s Theater<\/a>. It\u2019s also where famed magician <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Houdini_(dangling_from_the_B.F._Keith%27s_Theatre,_G_and_15th_Streets,_N.W.,_in_an_upside-down_straitjacket_escape,_Washington,_D.C.)_LCCN2016826965.jpg\">Harry Houdini once hung upside down<\/a> in a straitjacket.<\/p>\n<p>Reston Station was also attractive because of its location near the Wiehle-Reston East Metro <a href=\"https:\/\/restonstation.com\/\">station<\/a> on Metro\u2019s Silver Line.\u00a0Owens said that the Reston Station Ebbitt House is just the first of these suburban models the restaurant group is exploring \u2014 they\u2019re already eyeing sites throughout the region for others.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to adding more Ebbitt Houses, Clyde\u2019s is focusing on adding other restaurants with a smaller footprint and more narrowly focused menus. That potentially includes 7,000 to 8,000-square-foot restaurants centered on seafood, sushi, and pizza.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s one that is geared towards the 20 and 30-something crowd really focused on the indoor\/outdoor bar-centric with music and tvs\u2026 with wood-fired pizza,\u201d Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different vibe and concept for us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Owens confirmed they are looking at a number of similar sites in the region, including around the Crystal City and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/12\/13\/metro-potomac-yard-station-open-may\/\">soon-to-open<\/a> Potomac Yard Metro stations.<\/p>\n<p>For the moment, the restaurant group remains focused on the D.C.-area, but Owens acknowledged they could potentially be interested in expanding elsewhere in the not-so-far-off future.<\/p>\n<p>While growth is coming, a few more recent developments have made the restaurant group consider other changes to its business model. Continued recovery from the pandemic and inflation has made margins even slimmer, Owens said.<\/p>\n<p>Menu prices have gone up by about 14%, he said, while operating expenses have risen by nearly 30%. The minimum wage in D.C. is also set <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/01\/17\/dc-council-votes-to-delay-initiative-82-increase-to-may\/\">to increase for tipped workers<\/a> in May and, again, in July.<\/p>\n<p>While there\u2019s hope that prices will stop going up, the reality is that might mean cutting back or adding an extra (and <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/10\/dc-restaurants-service-charges-violations-attorney-general-warning\/\">potentially fraught<\/a>) service charge, he said.<\/p>\n<p>Owens didn\u2019t say exactly how the group\u2019s dozen restaurants will adjust, only that they are looking at all possibilities and want to avoid making it more confusing for diners.\u00a0He also said the increasing minimum wage in D.C. is also playing a part in where the restaurant is looking to expand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a lot of restaurants in the city and we love them,\u201d Owens said. \u201cAnd when we are looking at new locations, we certainly have to consider the fact that there\u2019s an uncertain environment of how things are going to unfold in the District.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the moment, though, Clyde\u2019s Restaurant Group is focused on opening up Ebbitt House in Reston in less than two years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOld Ebbitt Grill, I call it a unicorn of a restaurant. So many people from all walks of life feel comfortable there\u2026 we\u2019ve always wanted to expand that brand,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe hope Ebbitt House is our suburban model of that.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Clyde\u2019s Restaurant Group is launching Ebbitt House, which it hopes to bring to multiple locations around the D.C. region.

The vote came three years after the Virginia General Assembly first gave localities the option to <a href=\"https:\/\/lis.virginia.gov\/cgi-bin\/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB582\">grant collective bargaining rights to employees<\/a>, essentially dismantling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/archive\/politics\/1977\/01\/15\/court-voids-public-union-pacts-in-va\/3fe1c367-7983-43e5-890f-ec405cf4027f\/\">a 1977 Virginia Supreme Court<\/a> ruling that said otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/go.boarddocs.com\/vsba\/fairfax\/Board.nsf\/goto?open&amp;id=CGC4WW0CE171\">22-page resolution<\/a> was developed over the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ffxnow.com\/2021\/12\/20\/fcps-starts-effort-to-allow-collective-bargaining-for-school-workers\/\">last 15 months<\/a> and included a number of work-group sessions, negotiations, and public hearings. It provides 28,000 county public school employees the ability to elect a union to negotiate contracts, which would provide standards for pay, conditions, and benefits.<\/p>\n<p>The hope is that by allowing school employees to collectively bargain, it might help address retention and recruiting issues that have led to staffing shortages <a href=\"https:\/\/www.virginiamercury.com\/2022\/08\/09\/virginias-teacher-shortage-is-fueling-big-spending-on-recruitment-and-retention\/\">across the county and state<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The resolution also provides similar rights to school employees as their Fairfax County government worker counterparts, which were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ffxnow.com\/2021\/10\/20\/collective-bargaining-approved-for-fairfax-county-government-workers\/\">approved for collective bargaining<\/a> back in 2021. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apsva.us\/post\/arlington-school-board-passes-collective-bargaining-agreement\/\">Arlington School Board<\/a> passed a similar resolution last year, giving their teachers and staff collective bargaining rights.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis vote is a demonstration not only of our commitment to improving school staffing, pay, and morale but also to better outcomes for students,\u201d Fairfax County School Board member Karl Frisch said upon introducing the motion. \u201cIn addition to engaged parents, there is no greater driver of student success than classroom teachers and school staff.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It is expected that employees will elect the Alliance of Fairfax Educational Unions (AFEU), which consists of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fairfaxea.org\/\">Fairfax Education Association<\/a> (FEA) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcft.org\/\">Fairfax County Federation of Teachers<\/a> (FCFT), to represent them.<\/p>\n<p>David Walrod, president of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers, told DCist\/WAMU that last night\u2019s vote is a cause for celebration since it\u2019s been nearly 50 years in the making.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCollective bargaining had been banned in Virginia for public sector employees since 1977. And yesterday, Fairfax County was finally able to kind of move past that,\u201d Walrod said. \u201cWhat [collective bargaining will] do is it\u2019s going to give educators a seat at the table for the first time. And we know that teachers and teacher working conditions are student learning conditions. And so by improving teacher working conditions, we\u2019re really improving the conditions that students work under.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-allowfullscreen=\"true\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/?v=560043326098874\"><\/div>\n<p>A number of school board members reiterated this sentiment, adding that making sure teachers are treated fairly leads to increase teacher motivation, retention, and recruitment which improves student performance and success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have issues with teacher retention and recruitment in Virginia,\u201d School Board chair Rachna Sizemore Heizer said at the meeting. \u201cAverage teacher pay in Virginia is more than 10% below the national average in 2020 and 2021. These things matter because you do the work. You do the work of creating a better future for our country\u2026 you all do amazing work making our students love school and helping them learn and become the amazing people that they are. We owe it to you, to work hand in hand with you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both union leadership and the school board noted that while this was a big step, there\u2019s more work to be done. This resolution only takes the first step in granting the option to employees to collectively bargain.<\/p>\n<p>The next steps are for 30% of the unit to note that they actually want collective bargaining and that they want AFEU to represent them. Walrod says he expects that to happen soon, but actually negotiating an agreement with the school district that would lay out pay, benefits, and condition standards could take longer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would love to say that we\u2019d have a contract tomorrow, but that probably isn\u2019t realistic,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to have a contract in place for the 2025 fiscal year, which starts July 1, 2024. Walrod said the top-line items they are looking to negotiate are pay, health insurance benefits, classroom size, and general workload with <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/08\/29\/dc-region-schools-return\/\">staffing shortages remaining a concern<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few things the resolution doesn\u2019t do.<\/p>\n<p>It excludes substitute teachers or temporary employees from the bargaining unit. It also only recognizes three bargaining units \u2013 licensed instructional staff, operational employees, and administrators and supervisors.<\/p>\n<p>As several board members noted, not all school jobs fit neatly into those categories. So, another motion was introduced and approved that would allow for more than three collective bargaining units in the future. A resolution about that is expected to be developed and brought to the board by July 1, though several board members expressed their desire to push the deadline to Sept. 1.<\/p>\n<p>Walrod said that the union\u2019s priority is to make sure everyone\u2019s needs are heard and supports this resolution.<\/p>\n<p>Some school board members did note that the process took a bit longer than expected, but it ended with a shared agreement to grant employees the option to collectively bargain for better pay, benefits, and working condition<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201c<\/em>Our goal is a better Fairfax for teachers, for students, for bus drivers, for custodial workers, for food service workers, and instructional assistants,\u201d Walrod said. \u201cOur goal is that we\u2019re going to end up with something that\u2019s better for everybody<em>.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The school board for Virginia&#8217;s largest school system voted late last night to grant

The final vote was 81 for, 14 against, and one senator voting \u201cpresent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The lopsided vote is a stunning rebuke of D.C.\u2019s years-long effort to revise and modernize its criminal code, an initiative that ran headfirst into a national political buzzsaw that Republicans were eager to wield to more broadly to paint Biden and Democrats as soft on crime.<\/p>\n<p>For their part, Democrats were forced to play defense, largely abandoning their usual support for the city\u2019s ability to govern itself. Only two Democratic senators spoke on behalf of the city\u2019s bill during a debate on Wednesday afternoon, while more than a dozen Republicans inveighed against it and darkly painted D.C. as crime-ridden and a \u201cscarcely recognizable shadow of its former self,\u201d according to Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa).<\/p>\n<p>Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) echoed that concern.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRepublicans in Congress have taken an important stand to not stand by and watch the radical D.C. Council further inflame the crime wave engulfing our constituents\u2019 capital city. I myself am afraid for my own wife to walk from her apartment to the Capitol. I\u2019m afraid for my own staff to walk from working here to their own homes. This last Christmas, I gave every woman on my staff a special device to be able to defend herself should she be attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is real. We see it every day in this city. We see the crime. Everywhere we go, this city is no longer safe. The city no longer belongs to the people. The city now belongs to the criminals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Republicans have broadly attacked the revision of D.C.\u2019s criminal code as being a gift to criminals at a time of rising crime in many cities. The overhaul \u2014 which started some 16 years ago, and was unanimously approved by the D.C. Council late last year \u2014 repealed outdated offenses and clarified others, created a new slate of penalties, eliminated almost all mandatory minimum sentences, expanded the right to a jury trial to people charged with misdemeanors, and expanded the ability of people in prison to request a sentence reduction.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican senators who spoke against the bill on Wednesday largely took aim at provisions that reduce maximum penalties for certain violent offenses, focusing in particular on armed carjacking. The revised code decreases the current maximum penalty from the current 40 years to 24 years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the midst of ongoing crime, the D.C. City Council thought that now was an appropriate time to rewrite the criminal code instead of enforcing law and order,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia). \u201cThe D.C. Council found it fitting to lessen the punishment for violent criminal offenses. Hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But the two Democrats who spoke in favor of the revised criminal code said Republicans were mischaracterizing the effort for political purposes, especially on the penalties.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLooking at the totality of this bill, it is impossible to say that it isn\u2019t about making D.C. safer and having tougher penalties on crime. It actually quadruples the maximum penalty for attempted murder. It triples the maximum penalty for sexual assault because people in D.C. see those as serious crimes and they want to seriously increase the consequences for,\u201d said Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey).<\/p>\n<p>Booker and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) also pointed out that D.C.\u2019s new penalties for armed carjacking would actually be higher than in many states represented by Republican senators speaking against the bill.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy rejecting this law today, by voting against this, people in the name of being \u2018tough on crime\u2019 are actually the people that are preventing a city from better protecting itself, better protecting its children, its sexual assault victims, its police officers. I mean, think about that. I have not in my ten years in the Senate seen such a distortion of facts, such a misrepresentation of what something is,\u201d said Booker.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the debate, some 200 residents, activists, and elected officials rallied outside Union Station and marched to Congress, where they protested congressional interference in the city\u2019s affairs.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at the rally, Councilmember Robert White (D-At Large) touched on the dual complaints from many residents and activists: Congress was getting involved in a local matter, and doing so based on a misunderstanding of what the revisions to the city\u2019s criminal code would do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCongress feels that they need to come and say, \u2018No, we know better than what you know.\u2019 They don\u2019t. They\u2019re not accountable here. We don\u2019t know them, we don\u2019t see them in these streets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re condemning a law as extreme when the law is stricter than the laws in most of their states. Yeah, these laws in this revised criminal code are more restrictive than the laws in most of their states.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking inside the building where the rally goers gathered, Van Hollen similarly made the case that Congress should not interfere in the city\u2019s local affairs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all have governors, we all have state legislatures. No one here would appreciate [Congress] interfering and overturning decisions made by their state representatives or local representatives, even if we disagree with their decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I may not have supported every one of these provisions\u2026 I\u2019m not sitting on the D.C. Council, and neither is any of the other senators in this chamber.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) voted against the Senate disapproval resolution, while Virginia two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, cited Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s opposition to the revised code in saying that it \u201cwasn\u2019t ready from prime time\u201d and that they would vote to block it.<\/p>\n<p>At the rally, activists also expressed a growing concern that if Congress is willing to block this bill passed by the D.C. Council, other laws could be next. Hannah Chichester Downs with the D.C. Abortion Fund said that she worries that Congress could restrict abortion access.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we give D.C. statehood, because if the federal government overturns abortion care in D.C., then there\u2019s really no other place for women to go other than maybe like two other states,\u201d Chichester Downs said.<\/p>\n<p>The expected passage of the disapproval resolution also marks a new low in D.C.\u2019s half-century of self-governance. Congress has only stepped in to block local bills on three occasions since the city gained an elected mayor and legislature in the mid-1970s, and no such effort has been successful over the last three decades. Past disapproval resolutions that cleared Congress included one to stop a building near the FBI headquarters that would have been 20 feet taller than the city\u2019s height restrictions traditionally allow, and another bill that would have restricted where foreign embassies can be located.<\/p>\n<p>But it does fit a broader pattern of Republicans targeting D.C., a majority Democratic city, on a range of hot-button social issues. In the mid-1970s, congressional Republicans unsuccessfully tried to block a D.C. bill that banned handgun ownership in the city. A decade later, they tried to overturn a D.C. bill that pulled any investments out of apartheid South Africa, and another that gave people who tested positive for HIV access to health insurance. More recently, a Republican-led attempt to block a D.C. bill that legalized physician-assisted suicide was stymied by the Senate.<\/p>\n<p>Josh Burch, a local statehood activist and founder of Neighbors United for D.C. Statehood, worries that the congressional move to block D.C.\u2019s revised criminal code sets a bad precedent for the next two years of Republican control of the House.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe only place that this irrational and irresponsible House GOP will have legislative successes is as it relates to D.C., and those successes will be bad for us. They\u2019re not going to be able to pass legislation that has national impact, but they can pick on D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats who support statehood are also setting a bad precedent by going against D.C., because they will now pick and choose what lines they can cross. This is going to be a really weird system going forward when they\u2019re going to choose when to meddle in D.C. based on political convenience back home.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The lopsided bipartisan vote was a stunning rebuke of D.C.&#8217;s bill, but also a recognition of how Republicans have played the issue of crime for political gain.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/23\/03\/08\/senate-votes-to-block-dc-criminal-code-overhaul\/","currentSlug":"senate-votes-to-block-dc-criminal-code-overhaul","created":"2023-03-08T20:40:18","modified":"2023-03-08T20:51:42","time":"Mar 08, 2023","timestamp":1678308018,"timestampGMT":1678326018,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Some 200 residents, activists, and elected officials rallied outside Union Station ahead of the Senate&#8217;s vote on Wednesday.<\/p>\n","description":{"rendered":"<p class=\"attachment\"><a href='https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest.jpg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"},"altText":"","width":680,"height":510,"sizes":{"medium":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w"},"thumbnail":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-150x150.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-150x150.jpg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x300.jpg 300w"},"ratio11":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-150x150.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-150x150.jpg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x300.jpg 300w"},"ratio112x":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x300.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x300.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-150x150.jpg 150w"},"ratio43Small":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w"},"ratio43Smallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w"},"ratioOriginalSmall":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w"},"ratioOriginalSmallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w"},"full":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest-600x450.jpg 600w"}},"provider":"DCist\/WAMU","producer":"Matt Blitz","source_url":false},"postMeta":{"person":"13,6197012","secondaryImage":{"type":"","data":""},"titleOverride":false,"urlOrigin":false},"audio":{"postPermalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/23\/03\/08\/senate-votes-to-block-dc-criminal-code-overhaul\/"},"beat":"","beatSlug":"","slug":{"name":"","permalink":"#","categoryName":"","providerClass":"provider-wamu","flagSlug":"","flagText":"","nameOverride":false},"promoted":"","headMeta":{"title":"Matt Blitz | WAMU","description":"The lopsided bipartisan vote was a stunning rebuke of D.C.'s bill, but also a recognition of how Republicans have played the issue of crime for political gain.","canonical":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/23\/03\/08\/senate-votes-to-block-dc-criminal-code-overhaul\/","featured_image":{"url":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/protest.jpg","width":680,"height":510},"image":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wamu-default-og-image.png"}}],"paginate":true,"page":1,"endpoint":"wamu-person\/6197012\/related\/"}],"gptTargeting":{"show":"","topics":"","beat":"","collection":"","url":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/person\/matt-blitz\/","subdomain":"https:\/\/wamu.org","context":"Person"},"widgets":[],"showList":[{"ID":482589,"post_author":"24","post_date":"2016-12-13 13:01:39","post_date_gmt":"2016-12-13 18:01:39","post_content":"<p class=\"story-intro\"><em>1A<\/em> is a show for a changing America.<\/p>\r\nEvery day, <em>1A<\/em> convenes a conversation about the most important issues of our time.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
