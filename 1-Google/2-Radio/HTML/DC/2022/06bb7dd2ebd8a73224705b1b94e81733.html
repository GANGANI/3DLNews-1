The overwhelming majority of those are Black and Hispanic households.<\/p>\n<p>Published Thursday by researchers from the Urban Institute, the report defines housing insecurity as living arrangements that are either unaffordable or inadequate, or so tenuous that occupants have to make frequent or unwanted moves. The researchers excluded unhoused people from their total.<\/p>\n<p>Black residents comprise 41% of the D.C. population but 68% of those facing housing insecurity, the authors found. Hispanic residents represent 7% of the city\u2019s population but 14% of the housing insecure population. Conversely, while white residents comprise 40% of D.C.\u2019s population, only 9% of people facing housing insecurity are white.<\/p>\n<p>One of the groups most affected by housing insecurity is children: An estimated one in five kids ages 17 and younger in D.C. face housing insecurity, the authors found.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe think that the report has some pretty dire findings, and that is even one of our most conservative [estimates] of housing insecurity,\u201d Lydia Lo, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told DCist\/WAMU. \u201cOne of the striking statistics that we didn\u2019t enjoy finding but that was really illuminating is just, what resources and options you have to weather insecurity vary dramatically by race and by what kind of household you\u2019re in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lo pointed to their research indicating that, of the white residents they found that face housing insecurity, half of those people are couch surfing or staying with friends to reduce living costs. But Black residents \u2013 who were also more likely to live in households with children \u2013 were more likely to experience other challenges, like overcrowding, housing with inadequate conditions issues like pests, and unaffordability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are Black in this city, and you\u2019re housing insecure, you are dealing with inadequate housing, you are dealing with unaffordability, and that speaks to the different types of resources [available],\u201d Lo adds.<\/p>\n<p>Urban Institute conducted the study in conjunction with The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, the nonprofit provider that coordinates D.C.\u2019s homeless services system. The study is among the first to attempt to measure the scope of housing insecurity in D.C., in part because there is no widely accepted definition of the concept.<\/p>\n<p>The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development narrowly defines homelessness, for example, as people who live on the street or stay in emergency shelters, excluding populations who participate in time-limited housing programs or stay with friends and relatives. Other federal agencies\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nche.ed.gov\/mckinney-vento-definition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">do recognize doubling up<\/a>\u00a0as a form of homelessness.<\/p>\n<p>Lo says that The Community Partnership approached Urban Institute as pandemic-era social service programs began to draw to a close, hoping to better understand how those changes would affect the people they serve.<\/p>\n<p>To capture the myriad forms that housing insecurity can take, the team created its own survey of more than a dozen metrics \u2013 ranging from poor housing quality to rent\/mortgage payment uncertainty and a history of frequent moves \u2013 designed with feedback from focus groups conducted with people experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity, as well as those who work in housing and real estate.<\/p>\n<p>Survey respondents who answered yes to five or more of the team\u2019s metrics were categorized as housing insecure. Respondents were automatically considered housing insecure if they had received an eviction notice, faced foreclosure, or were living in their household temporarily.<\/p>\n<p>The team found that, among those facing housing insecurity, the most common type is housing unaffordability, followed by inadequate housing and unwanted moves.<\/p>\n<p>Claudia Solari, another of the report\u2019s lead authors, encourages readers to pay close attention to the kinds of housing insecurity residents face \u2013 not just how many people face them.<\/p>\n<p>For those who can\u2019t afford their housing, policy interventions could include subsidies like mortgage or rental assistance. But those tools are less helpful for people who are moving for reasons unrelated to cost, she says; and in cases where renters are having problems with their landlord, it could be more beneficial to fund landlord mediations. \u201cThe way you plan your resources and who\u2019s going to access them really will differ because of the different forms of instability people are experiencing,\u201d Solari says.<\/p>\n<p>The report comes amid a flurry of other studies indicating that more D.C. residents than ever face financial precarity: More than 44,000 D.C. residents\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/09\/19\/dc-residents-income-rent\/\">spend more than half of their income on rent<\/a>, one report published in October found, while more than one-third of residents\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/09\/12\/dc-food-insecurity-report\/\">face food insecurity<\/a>.

The school announced in 2022 it would sell the building, called the Aston, for $27.5 million.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The city has said that its Department of General Services intends to acquire the GW dorm to provide medical care to unhoused people with acute conditions \u2013 a model for transitional housing that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/01\/09\/dc-ending-hotel-shelter-homeless\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sprouted up during the pandemic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis is an intervention that is very much needed in our toolbox for people experiencing homelessness,\u201d Rachel Pierre, the interim director of D.C.\u2019s Department of Human Services, said at a June 21 community meeting about its acquisition of the Aston.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Existing shelters in D.C. don\u2019t currently accept mixed-gender adult families without kids, like couples or siblings trying to stay together. Instead, the city splits those groups by gender and directs them to one of the 10 \u201clow-barrier\u201d \u2013 or first-come, first-served \u2013 shelters it runs. Those shelters house dozens of people per room and don\u2019t offer private bathrooms, making it difficult for people with chronic medical conditions to manage their care there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With an upper capacity of 190 residents, the Aston could change that. Unlike low-barrier shelters, DHS\u2019s proposed facility would house one to two people per bedroom, and provide each unit with a private bathroom. The new site will also provide medical treatment for residents with acute conditions. Barring significant construction delays, DHS says it aims to open the shelter by November.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe have an opportunity to provide housing to people who are in desperate need of it,\u201d says Jim Malec, chairperson of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission with jurisdiction over the site. \u201cThese are people who [DHS says] are suffering from end stage kidney failure, people who have cancer, people with ALS, and I think we should prioritize them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But intervention from the D.C. Council, led by Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto, has slow-walked the project, if not threatened it altogether. Pinto has said she wants more time to solicit community feedback, which has been mixed during public hearings so far \u2013 West End residents have by turns embraced and denigrated the possible shelter, and business groups have generally rallied against it.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Department of General Services was originally scheduled to execute the sale on June 22, when the D.C. Council\u2019s 10-day review \u2013 a period required for any contract over $10 million \u2013 lapsed. But on June 21, Pinto introduced a disapproval resolution of the project, which extends the council\u2019s review period by 35 days. The council now has until July 27 to weigh in on the contract, which will automatically be approved if lawmakers decide not to veto the plan. (Chairman Phil Mendelson and At-Large Councilmember Christina Henderson co-sponsored the resolution.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pinto herself did not appear at a public meeting about the proposal hosted by the neighborhood\u2019s Advisory Neighborhood Commission on June 21, and her chief of staff, Genevieve Hulick, did not comment on Pinto\u2019s views about the project itself. Hulick said only that a delay by Mayor Muriel Bowser in sending the sale contract to the council cut into lawmakers\u2019 time to solicit and review feedback from residents, and that procedural concerns over the D.C. government\u2019s transparency necessitated intervention.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWithout the resolution, residents\u2019 voices would not be heard on this purchase. Meaningful community engagement is critical to the success of proposed major projects like this one,\u201d Pinto said in an emailed statement to DCist\/WAMU via a spokesperson. \u201cThe Mayor and the Council should consider residents support [sic], concerns, and opinions on the matter before moving forward with the approval of a contract.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Opposition, to the extent that it exists, has largely fallen along two lines: procedural concerns, like those expressed by Pinto, and substantive ones, with some arguing that Ward 2 shouldn\u2019t open a new shelter at all because it will degrade the character of the neighborhood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the June 21 public hearing about the project, tempers flared, one resident loudly declaring that diners would stop flocking to Rasika, the Michelin-starred restaurant sitting across the street from the planned shelter. Others pushed Pierre and Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Wayne Turnage to explain how the city government planned to mitigate noise, trash, and security concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Matthew Pestronk, president of real estate development group Post Brothers Apartments, encouraged development executives operating in D.C. to lobby the District government against the acquisition, arguing in an email that there are \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">many reasons why this use does not fit into the immediate area in the West End of downtown.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Also copied on the email, obtained by DCist\/WAMU, was former mayor Anthony Williams.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reimagining Downtown<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> program championed by the mayor and everyone on this email \u2026 does not contemplate uses like shelters being additive to the return of downtown when placed in an extremely high profile location,\u201d Pestronk wrote. \u201cIt is in all of our enlightened self-interests to help the city solve the homeless problem in the most productive way possible while protecting the city\u2019s assets.\u201d A spokesperson for the company declined DCist\/WAMU\u2019s request for comment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners also began to receive a flurry of automated emails from people urging caution in the project. \u201cThe truncated public review timeline has put the community in an unfair position,\u201d the message read in part, according to a copy reviewed by DCist\/WAMU. Fear that discontent among a vocal few would derail the whole endeavor led commissioners like Yannik Omictin to organize official support for the proposal within the ANC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While one commissioner initially penned a competing statement that would have predicated support on more information from DHS, the nine-member commission ultimately expressed support for the shelter. On June 28, the group urged DHS to respond to a number of outstanding questions \u2013 like how it plans to transition residents out of the facility, and what kind of security it can offer \u2013 but said that, in general, it supports the development of a non-congregate shelter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cComing in, there was a narrative that a lot of people wanted to believe, which was that the neighborhood is staunchly opposed to a facility like this,\u201d Omictin said. \u201cBut what we saw \u2026 was an outpouring of support from the community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea to do this. My concern is that it\u2019s done so that it\u2019s successful,\u201d one woman who lives in the neighborhood testified at the meeting in June. Another pointedly said: \u201cI am happy to go to restaurants near a homeless shelter\u2026Michelin stars and all.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In an interview with DCist\/WAMU, Turnage said of the meeting: \u201cI\u2019ve heard some people say \u2018no, we don\u2019t we don\u2019t think this fits with the the tenor and tone of the neighborhood.\u2019 And I\u2019ve heard others who are certainly richer than I am, and who say, \u2018you know, we need to find a way to help persons who are experiencing homelessness, and this project can do it in a way that does not undermine or deteriorate my neighborhood and I\u2019ll support it.\u2019 I will say, at the community meeting, it was almost evenly split, if not more in favor of the project than not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The debate is reminiscent of a similar fight that played out, albeit on a much larger scale, during Bowser\u2019s first term in office, when she closed the noxious DC General family shelter and replaced it with smaller shelters for unhoused people in most wards across D.C. Coalitions of residents in wards 3 and 5 sued to prevent the developments from panning out, although those efforts were not ultimately successful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But Ward 2 never got a new shelter, with officials arguing at the time that it didn\u2019t need one because it already hosted the Patricia Handy Place for Women, a shelter for single adult women. (That shelter temporarily closed shortly after for repairs.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The building currently in play is something of a unicorn, say Turnage and Pierre \u2013 relatively turnkey, zoned for its targeted use, and close to amenities. If the council intervenes to further delay closing or scrap the purchase altogether, it could prove difficult to find another site.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cTrying to find a building that can be readily converted to transitional housing with a minimum amount of construction and delay, in an urban area where, you know, almost every inch of land is claimed, is just very difficult,\u201d Turnage tells DCist\/WAMU. \u201cThe ward is replete with resources and amenities that could be very helpful in serving people who are experiencing homelessness as well.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ANC 2A chair Jim Malec says he understands concerns from residents that they haven\u2019t had significant time to weigh in on the site. But he believes it would be a misstep to sacrifice this site over smaller details.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf we\u2019re going to argue that we should not create a space for 200 people who need a home, I would ask, what is the moral or ethical justification for that argument?\u201d he asks, referencing the emails he\u2019s received about trash, security, and noise concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt\u2019s a general overarching statement that homeless people make our community less safe. And I think that\u2019s offensive. Because ultimately, what it says is \u2018I think poor people make our community less safe,\u2019\u201d Malec says. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to expect that DHS has a plan for how we\u2019re going to deal with these issues, when they come up. But we can walk and chew gum at the same time. We don\u2019t have to deny housing to people who desperately need it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Ward 2 is finally set to receive its own iteration of a family homeless

Their landlord is suing to evict them anyway","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Late last November, Taniya Rogers was living in her car. Even when other neighbors in her Langdon apartment building began trickling back in \u2013 after a gas leak documented the day before Thanksgiving sent several of them packing \u2013 Rogers couldn\u2019t stomach returning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s because the cockroaches in her apartment had grown so thick that they began falling off the ceiling onto her kids, she says \u2013 she even found them in their beds when she\u2019d pull their blankets back to sleep at night. So for two months, the 32-year-old slept with her two preschool-aged sons in their car, in the parking lot of their apartment complex at 1511 Franklin Street NE.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI was very scared,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cI was nervous about the building blowing up.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fifty-eight-year-old Tappi Small, meanwhile, heard her carbon monoxide alarm ring on Nov. 23. When she called maintenance about it, Small says the responder told her to shut off the alarm with the back end of a broom. She did, but she says she almost immediately started experiencing chest pains and difficulty breathing. By the time she called 911 and paramedics arrived, she recalls, \u201cThey said if I didn\u2019t call them and get out of here, I\u2019d have been dead on Thanksgiving.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A report from Washington Gas shows that her stove was leaking carbon monoxide at 300 parts per million \u2013 those levels are high enough to result in death, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpsc.gov\/Safety-Education\/Safety-Education-Centers\/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center\/Carbon-Monoxide-Questions-and-Answers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">according to<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-4991203 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/06\/IMG_1803-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"437\" height=\"709\" \/>During DCist\/WAMU\u2019s visit in late May to the rent-stabilized building, the basement still reeked of gas. Washington Gas has been back to the building at least three times this spring, records show, with one hazardous conditions notice from May 27 saying that the technician found \u201cmultiple leaks on houseline of apartment building.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the time since conditions issues crescendoed last fall, the building owner, Brookland Investments I LLC, has sued to evict at least 13 of the building\u2019s 18 households over nonpayment of rent. Three of those tenants tell DCist\/WAMU that they\u2019re intentionally withholding rent until the owner and property manager make serious repairs to the building. But Brookland Investments isn\u2019t just trying to collect back rent \u2013 it\u2019s trying to repossess some of those tenants\u2019 apartments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An attorney for Brookland Investments didn\u2019t comment on why the company is seeking repossession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A handful of those eviction cases have closed, with tenants either ordered out of their apartments or entered into settlement agreements. Others, like those involving Rogers and Shanta Rodriguez, president of the building\u2019s tenant association, are ongoing. Rodriguez is scheduled for a mediation session with the plaintiff this fall, and has requested a jury trial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While D.C. offers some of the country\u2019s most progressive pro-renter protections, those have natural limitations, and the tenants of 1511 Franklin are brushing up against that ceiling. They\u2019re ultimately asking one question: should tenants have to pay to live in a building where they say their safety is risk?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Case law in D.C. supports the notion that renters in D.C. have the right to withhold rent if their building owner hasn\u2019t sufficiently addressed housing code violations, and the District government recognizes renters\u2019 right to strike. Tenants may also petition to receive a rent reduction if they can show that their living conditions violate the city\u2019s housing code. And as a Covid-era moratorium on filing evictions kept renters in their homes across the city, rent strikes proliferated, giving tenants leverage to demand better housing conditions without the looming threat of being ousted from their homes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One tenant advocacy group, Stomp Out Slumlords, helped organize at least 22 such strikes, DCist\/WAMU <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/01\/dc-brightwood-park-rent-strike\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reported in March<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Some of those resulted in significant wins for tenants, with property owners writing off thousands in back rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But tenants still take a risk when they strike, even more so now that the eviction moratorium has expired. While data from D.C.\u2019s Office of the Tenant Advocate indicates that evictions haven\u2019t yet reached <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dccouncil.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/ota.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pre-pandemic levels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, they are still <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dccouncil.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Pre-Hearing-Responses-OTA.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">occurring in droves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2013 there were 754 scheduled evictions in fiscal year 2022, 346 of them carried out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The business entity suing to evict Rodriguez and her neighbors is affiliated with NOVO Properties, the company that manages resident services at 1511 Franklin and more than 2,000 other housing units across the D.C. area. Those apartments run the gamut from older, rent-stabilized buildings to modern apartments that rent at market rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIn October 2022 the building owner was notified of a potential gas leak. The owner immediately conducted a building-wide pressure test. Some gas stove lines were found to be corroded and were replaced,\u201d Aaron Sokolow, an attorney representing Brookland Investments in its eviction cases, wrote in an email to DCist\/WAMU, along with invoices for gas line repair work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-4991202\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/06\/IMG_1827-rotated-e1687269084444.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"576\" \/>One invoice, dated Oct. 31, noted that the building\u2019s contractor found gas leaks in two units, and that corrosion would require them to replace 50 feet of gas lines in crawl space spanning five apartments. Sokolow also said that the building owner \u201ccontracts with a monthly pest control service to exterminate in the common areas, outside the building and inside resident apartments on a rotating basis and upon request.\u201d Sokolow didn\u2019t respond to a question clarifying whether the work was ultimately carried out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rodriguez maintains that neither NOVO nor Brookland Investments has communicated with tenants about the gas issues, and that ongoing issues with gas leaks indicate that more repair work needs to be done.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For her part, Rodriguez is not sentimental: the 12-year resident of 1511 Franklin St. is an encyclopedia of dates, records, and photographs. She and her neighbors have lived with the issues plaguing their building for so long that she barely registers the smell of natural gas perfuming her halls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In May, wearing a pastel Golden Girls T-shirt and a pair of oversized sunglasses, she marched from one floor to another, from the front porch to the parking lot and basement, identifying rat nests and unsealed windows and exposed wiring that runs directly into the dirt at her feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe live in fear,\u201d she says simply. Just a week before, a judge ordered that beginning in January, Rodriguez\u2019 rent be reduced by about $200 per month.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But these women say they have no interest in leaving the building: they\u2019re organizing to protect a found community, one that watches each others\u2019 kids, organizes potlucks, and advocates on behalf of each other. Shortly before that evening\u2019s tenant association meeting, as people began to trickle into folding chairs arranged in a crescent along boxes of pizza in the building\u2019s foyer, Rogers paused in the stairwell.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She remembers moving into the building several years ago with her partner, who has since passed away, thinking about how charming it was from the outside, dreaming about their future together. As the years progressed and life got harder, she was struck by an organizer\u2019s sign hanging inside the elevator, asking whether the reader had to choose between feeding their kids or putting gas in the car. She remembers feeling seen, and motivated to action \u2013 that at a time when rent is more expensive than ever, she and her neighbors shouldn\u2019t have to spend so much money on a home that doesn\u2019t feel safe to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe\u2019re just letting people know what their rights are and that they have a chance to make things right,\u201d Rogers says, \u201cfrom what has been wrong to them for so long.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Brookland Investments I LLC has sued to evict at least 13 of the

Minnesota Commons is a developer\u2019s dream, sitting kitty-corner from the Minnesota Avenue metro station just across from D.C.\u2019s Department of Employment Services. Many of his neighbors have called the complex home for 20 or 30 years, some of them seniors whose children gently but persistently urge them to move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But Wilkerson, who watched conditions at the property slowly decline after he moved in, felt a sense of resolve. The native Washingtonian \u2013 who also happens to work in construction \u2013 knows all too well what can happen when renters living on prime land get a notice that their home is changing hands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI am trying to make myself and this neighborhood a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fighting not just for me, but for all of these people who live here. We don\u2019t want to go.\u201d When the tenants of 4089 Minnesota Ave. voted Wilkerson in as their new tenant association president, he didn\u2019t object.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The group saw their forthcoming sale, and subsequent rights under the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dhcd.dc.gov\/service\/tenant-opportunity-purchase-assistance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, as a way to leverage some much-needed repairs. Under TOPA, tenants in certain apartment complexes have the right of first offer when the buildings go up for sale. They can also assign those rights to a development partner of their choice \u2013 a carrot that incentivizes developers to include tenants in rehabilitation plans or offer them hefty buyouts to move.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At Minnesota Commons, tenants wanted two things: affordable rent and clean homes. Longtime resident Christine Smith says she won\u2019t use her bathroom sink to brush her teeth because the tap water smells like sewage \u2013 just one of three households that reported that condition to DCist\/WAMU. 75-year-old Josie Thomas told us that she and her husband refuse to cook anything more complicated than boiling water because of the mice infestation that has only grown worse since all of the neighbors on her floor vacated their apartments, and squatters moved in.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4988795\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 297px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-4988795\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/josie-minnesota-commons.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Baskin\" width=\"297\" height=\"396\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Josie Thomas, 75, has lived at the Minnesota Commons complex for decades.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNow the roaches have decided to come down and party on this end. And the mice,\u201d says Thomas, who moved into the building about 30 years ago when she worked for Marriott and liked being so close to a metro station. \u201cIf you throw water in [the apartment next door], it\u2019d grow some grass.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Todd Forster, counsel for the building owner, wrote DCist\/WAMU in an email that \u201cPrompt action is being taken to address and remedy the tenant concerns.\u201d He added that the complaints \u201care being addressed and, with the assistance of the Department of Buildings, we will continue to identify and respond to all legitimate complaints.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DCist\/WAMU attempted to contact the current owner of Minnesota Commons, which is listed on D.C. government websites as an LLC and does not name an associated agent. DCist\/WAMU asked Forster, who is named in sale documents, for the owner\u2019s name. Forster did not respond to that question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For a cool $10.79 million, the building could be owned by the tenants \u2013 or, thanks to TOPA, the development partner of their choice. They went with NFP, a local affordable housing nonprofit that promised to keep the building rent stabilized even after undergoing substantial remodeling. The pending sale was slated to close May 15, and tenants grew cautiously optimistic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But in early May, the equity partner who planned to help finance the purchase backed out, and NFP was forced\u00a0 to pull its offer. The deal that Wilkerson and his dozens of neighbors worked so hard to close ultimately fell through.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Minnesota Commons is now poised to go to the seller\u2019s hand-picked buyer: A business entity managed by Sam Razjooyan, a local developer who targets rent stabilized apartments to turn profit. Razjooyan\u2019s business model, as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/23\/03\/20\/sam-razjooyan-housing-choice-voucher-holders-rent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DCist\/WAMU reported in March<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2013 and that Razjooyan himself referenced in a business proposal he submitted to tenants last year \u2013 sees him offering buyouts to existing tenants, then filling the vacant apartments with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dchousing.org\/wordpress\/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">housing choice voucher<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> holders. Housing choice vouchers, a federal housing subsidy disbursed through the DC Housing Authority, are reimbursed at rates that can run several hundred dollars above what some rent-stabilized buildings ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sprawling rent-stabilized complex now in Razjooyan\u2019s crosshairs is exactly the kind of project the D.C. government has talked about protecting: affordable, home to seniors and native Washingtonians, and well-situated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What should have been a rousing success story has now become a cautionary tale, as industry leaders say that worsening market conditions, coupled with dwindling public dollars for affordable housing preservation, have made efforts to preserve affordability more challenging. That is particularly true for nonprofit organizations, which don\u2019t enjoy the same kind of access to capital as larger for-profit developers, but that prioritize lowering costs for tenants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe market is still moving forward in terms of favoring very, very deep pocketed developers who can afford to control their own deal without a nonprofit at the table and without other people inserting their mission needs into the transaction,\u201d says Mitch Greenstein, a real estate executive who has worked in D.C. since the late 70s and consulted for NFP on the Minnesota Commons sale. \u201cIt also seems to [favor] smaller developers who aren\u2019t as attuned to the needs of the local community.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A perfect storm of conditions led to the Minnesota Commons deal collapsing: high interest rates and skyrocketing construction costs made the prospect of rehabilitating the building incredibly expensive, to say nothing of its nearly $11 million asking price. A $2 billion <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aboutamazon.com\/news\/community\/amazon-launches-2-billion-housing-equity-fund-to-preserve-and-create-over-20-000-affordable-homes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Amazon-backed fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> intended to help finance affordable housing projects has started to run dry. Last year, for the first time, D.C. hit its bond volume cap \u2014 the amount of tax-exempt financing D.C. can award per calendar year \u2014 stiffening competition for steeper Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a critical tool used to finance affordable housing projects. \u201c[It] had gone from a situation where they were readily available to: they are now capped, and they became competitive,\u201d Greenstein says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4988798\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 425px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4988798\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/05\/sonic-minnesota-commons.jpg\" alt=\"Morgan Baskin\" width=\"425\" height=\"567\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">The affordable housing developer poised to buy Minnesota Commons \u2014 and keep it rent stabilized \u2014 lost its financing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs all of this was going on, interest rates were continuing to climb. Subsidy dollars for affordable housing in D.C. were becoming more scarce. And the investment community was getting a little bit less enamored with this kind of real estate in the shorter term,\u201d he adds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And as private equity players grow skittish, chatter has pitched that Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s administration is taking cues from them and shying away from funding major preservation projects, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">D.C.\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development administers the city\u2019s largest subsidy for affordable development and preservation through the Housing Production Trust Fund. But the fund has not solicited any new proposals since 2021, and that year, only three projects were selected for a 9% LIHTC subsidy; none of them were preservation projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And of the 21 development projects to receive HPTF funds from its last round of giving in 2021, only one \u2013 Aspen Street Cooperative, an apartment complex across from the Walter Reed campus whose tenants used TOPA to buy the building \u2013 was a preservation-only project. (D.C.\u2019s fiscal year 2024 budget, proposed by Bowser with signoff from the D.C. Council, will see D.C. cut back its investments into the Housing Production Trust Fund.) \u201cIt does seem that new construction is taking a priority over preservation,\u201d says Rick Eisen, a real estate attorney who represents nonprofit developers and tenant associations, as well as a member of the team that drafted D.C.\u2019s TOPA law in the late 1970s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Experts in affordable housing development say that public subsidies are critical for ensuring that the math works on major rehabilitation projects, like the one NFP tried to execute at Wilkerson\u2019s complex.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIn any case, doing any kind of committed affordable housing of high quality is very expensive\u201d says Melissa Bondi, the Mid-Atlantic State and Local Policy Director for Enterprise Community Partners, a national affordable housing nonprofit. Bondi says it\u2019s near-impossible for nonprofits to tackle major rehabilitation projects in D.C. \u201cAnd it is impossible to do preservation without subsidy.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Complicating the math is the fact that some preservation projects obtain financing help from one pot of DHCD funds for their acquisition, only to be denied further down the road for HPTF money that would make rehabilitation of the buildings possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannahomes.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MANNA DC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, one of the city\u2019s most prominent affordable housing developers, is now selling a portfolio of 19 apartment buildings it bought in 2019 because it\u2019s been unable to secure the financing necessary to execute its substantial renovation plan, according to sources with knowledge of the deal. It is also selling two other properties, one on South Capitol St. and one in Randle Highlands, because it couldn\u2019t secure financing to make renovations, that source also said. (Rozanne Look, MANNA\u2019s director of project development, didn\u2019t return DCist\/WAMU\u2019s requests for comment.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sam Razjooyan, part of the group poised to take over Minnesota Commons, has perfected a business model that hinges on buying rent-stabilized apartment buildings, remodeling them to add additional bedrooms, and renting out vacant units to housing choice voucher holders. Tenants in buildings managed by Razjooyan report living with sewage-stained carpets, bedbug infestations, and pervasive mold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI went and looked at a couple of his places, and it was worse than where I am right now. I\u2019m like, nah, I don\u2019t want to live up in here,\u201d says Wilkerson, who sat on Zoom calls with Razjooyan last spring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The rehabilitation proposal Razjooyan submitted to the tenant\u2019s association states that he is the managing member of a firm that owns and manages over 54 properties totaling 600 units across Northeast and Southeast D.C. \u201cWe specialize in affordable housing and work closely with the DC Housing Authority for those residents who utilize various subsidy programs,\u201d the proposal says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DCist\/WAMU asked Razjooyan in an email whether he plans on buying the building, given the collapse of the deal with NFP, and sticking with the development proposal outlined to tenants last year.\u00a0 Razjooyan\u2019s response was that last year he consulted for the business entity listed as the seller\u2019s third party purchaser and is not aware of its current intentions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Razjooyan\u2019s rehabilitation proposal to tenants states that while it is \u201cNOT our goal to displace anyone \u2026 we want to help accomplish your goal of either home ownership or assist to move to another community.\u201d The group said it would offer tenants $15,000 to vacate the building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Minnesota Commons tenants are now in limbo: unsure how their owner will proceed with a sale, the remodeling they desperately need even further on the horizon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Christine Smith, the Minnesota Commons tenant, lamented the collapse of the deal with NFP. \u201cI don\u2019t want him. Things are bad enough around here,\u201d Smith says.\u00a0 \u201cPlease, please, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">please<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Jesus, do not [let it

Then it began to rush.<\/p>\n<p>John\u2019s downstairs neighbor ran upstairs as Hunter frantically unlocked John\u2019s apartment. Water was raining out of the light fixtures in the neighbor\u2019s kitchen; seeping through her walls; oozing from the smoke detectors. Inside John\u2019s apartment, the scene was grim: a bathroom flooded to the shins, a current of water pouring out from holes in the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a little [water]. It was a whole lot,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cIt was horrendous.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the tenants of 4001 1st St., the plumbing debacle of December 2021 was garden variety horrendous \u2013 the kind that might have left them without water for days, but at least didn\u2019t end in any injuries. They had plenty of experience with the truly dangerous kind of horrendous, four tenants told DCist\/WAMU: plumbing issues that left a tenant\u2019s 12-year-old stepdaughter concussed when a bathroom cabinet fell off the water-soaked walls onto her head; pervasive mold that caused a resident\u2019s asthmatic young daughter to stop breathing.<\/p>\n<p>Other incidents ultimately drove John, who is in his 80s, from his home. John, who up until the building sold in 2019 had been its maintenance worker of more than a decade, keeping the hallways clean, the lawn raked, the parking lot clear of trash. John, who had a long-running friendship with Hunter that turned into something like care: Hunter even ordered him a Thanksgiving turkey in the fall of 2021.<\/p>\n<p>But Hunter never got to deliver it. John was hospitalized in November for severe leg burns he\u2019d sustained huddling near a space heater for warmth in his frigid apartment, where the heat had stopped working in the fall of 2021. Hunter is the one who discovered him and called an ambulance, and John has been in and out of assisted care facilities ever since. (DCist\/WAMU was unable to speak with John for this story, and is using only his first name to protect his privacy).<\/p>\n<p>More than one year after the flooding, John\u2019s apartment was still uninhabitable. The air was thick with the musty odor of mold, and a yawning hole in the kitchen ceiling bore the long-unfinished attempts to repair the pipes above it. The floors were scattered with crusty piles of plaster; the bathroom walls, meanwhile, were splattered with black goo. John\u2019s old crutches rested on the dusty blue couch in his living room, next to a Bible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know my friend will probably never come back here,\u201d Hunter said, standing under a collage of family photos that hang on John\u2019s living room wall. \u201cHe has nothing to come back to.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\">\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/230127_4001FirstSt_SE_Baskin_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/230127_4001FirstSt_SE_Baskin_03.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A hole in the ceiling in John&#8217;s apartment at 4001 1st St SE.<span class=\"credits\">Morgan Baskin \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/230127_4001FirstSt_SE_Baskin_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/230127_4001FirstSt_SE_Baskin_01.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The kitchen in John&#8217;s apartment at 4001 1st St SE.<span class=\"credits\">Morgan Baskin \/ DCist\/WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The catastrophes that have plagued the eight-unit apartment building at 4001 1st St. are relatively new. Not the foregone conclusion of a building that\u2019s reached the end of its natural life, they are instead the consequences of a series of failures wrought by a fledgling developer from Maryland named Sam Razjooyan, who took over the place in 2019 and is, in all likelihood, trying his best to flip a building near you.<\/p>\n<p>Thirty-five-year-old Razjooyan is a real estate developer with a strategy: acquire rent-stabilized buildings at rock-bottom prices; buy out remaining tenants; carve up units by adding drywall to create more bedrooms; and then market them to participants in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hud.gov\/topics\/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8#hcv01\">Housing Choice Voucher Program<\/a> or other housing subsidy programs, where, because of local and federal regulations (as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/investigations\/2023\/02\/15\/dc-housing-authority-overpays-landlords\/\">poor management on the part of D.C. agencies<\/a>), property owners can command double or triple what they would otherwise collect. He could employ this model perfectly at 4001 1st Street SE, an older building full of deeply affordable studio and one-bedroom apartments.<\/p>\n<p>But according to lawsuits and interviews with more than a half-dozen tenants across four properties, Razjooyan has left many of the tenants in the properties he\u2019s flipping living in abject squalor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><strong>What is a Housing Choice Voucher?<\/strong><br \/>\nHousing Choice Vouchers are the most common kind of federal housing subsidy in the country. These vouchers cover the vast majority of a renter\u2019s housing payment, and allow recipients to live in any apartment on the private rental market whose landlord will rent to them. (In D.C., it is illegal to discriminate against or deny housing to people who pay rent with the help of housing vouchers.) The DC Housing Authority awards these vouchers, but the federal housing department funds the program.<\/aside>\n<p>\u201cEmotionally, he has drained me,\u201d Andre Hunter told me, tears welling in his eyes. \u201cAnd I thought I was a strong person.\u201d Hunter now spends most of his time near family in Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>In the seven years preceding Razjooyan\u2019s acquisition of 4001 1st St., the building received four letters detailing property code compliance issues from the city. Since Razjooyan entered the picture four years ago, it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/scout.dcra.dc.gov\/compliance-enforcement-8938\">received 18<\/a>. Agency records show that city inspectors have levied at least $65,176 in unpaid fines against 4001 1st Street, S.E. as of March 2023, and cited it for at least 45 individual housing code violations since Razjooyan took it over. Those include citations for a lack of heat, rodent infestations, and the failure to maintain the premises \u201cin safe and sanitary condition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But $65,000 is paltry compared to the sums that other buildings tied to Razjooyan owe the D.C. government for housing infractions \u2013 one, at 109 Wayne Place S.E., racked up $95,000 in fines.<\/p>\n<p>Based on publicly available information about Razjooyan and his business partners, including his home address, DCist\/WAMU has identified 33 buildings with governing documents registered to Razjooyan and his associates, acquisitions topping more than $30 million.<\/p>\n<p>The full scope of his acquisitions and ownership stake in these properties is effectively shielded from public view: Ownership information on sale documents we obtained from multiple city agencies is either redacted or absent, naming only the LLCs registered as building owners. But based on court documents and interviews with tenants and tenant representatives, the developer appears to be the linchpin in many of these transactions, identifying which buildings are ripe for redevelopment and helping manage their sale and construction \u2013 with the end goal of creating units rentable to voucher holders.<\/p>\n<p>Units in at least 10 of the buildings tied to Razjooyan have rented to DCHA clients, housing contracts obtained by DCist\/WAMU show.<\/p>\n<p>In response to a five-page list of questions detailing the allegations levied against him by current tenants, Razjooyan said in an email that he addresses maintenance requests in a timely manner. While he often buys buildings out of bankruptcy already in poor condition, conditions \u201cimprove greatly over time,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYour statements are inaccurate and don\u2019t reflect the amount of my actual involvement, the condition of the properties or the specific events that occurred with respect to specific tenants identified,\u201d he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/632318596\/Razjooyan-Comment\">wrote<\/a>. Razjooyan did not comment on his rental history with voucher programs and did not confirm which of these buildings he owns outright.<\/p>\n<div class=\"googlemaps\"><\/div>\n<p>The vast majority of the apartments in the sprawling kingdom of buildings Razjooyan has helped redevelop are located in Wards 7 and 8, the poorest areas of the city. This is no accident: These areas have the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/27346\/412347-A-Rent-Control-Report-for-the-District-of-Columbia.PDF\">highest concentration of buildings<\/a> potentially subject to rent control, and have not enjoyed the kind of commercial or residential investment seen in more affluent parts of D.C. They are also where the <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/09\/13\/dc-housing-vouchers-rent-control\/\">majority of people<\/a> who use housing vouchers currently live.<\/p>\n<p>And as traditional public housing complexes continue to decay with age and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/housing\/cuts-in-federal-assistance-have-exacerbated-families-struggles-to-afford-housing\">attrition<\/a>, housing vouchers \u2013 which provide government money to pay a portion of a person\u2019s rent \u2013 have become an increasingly important tool to combat homelessness amid a worsening housing crisis.<\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s waiting list for public housing closed a decade ago with 20,000 names on it; 37,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/06\/24\/dc-housing-authority-waitlist-voucher-funding\/\">more people<\/a> currently sit on a waiting list for subsidized housing assistance. But D.C. often fails to properly vet and manage landlords who provide what was once a government service \u2013 and the city\u2019s unusually high rent thresholds for vouchers attract enterprising landlords who see a profit incentive to gut affordable buildings specifically to rent them out to voucher holders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe immediate effect [of this business model] is, there\u2019s now a force in the market that is actively displacing tenants who do not have vouchers,\u201d says Eliana Golding, a housing and workforce policy analyst at the DC Fiscal Policy Institute.<\/p>\n<p>About 12,000 D.C. families <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/release\/ag-racine-announces-largest-civil-penalty-housing\">rely on<\/a> the Housing Choice Voucher Program, formerly known as Section 8, to pay for their homes. Ninety-five percent of voucher holders are Black, and the majority of participating households are seniors and people who live with a disability. (D.C. has also funded a local version of housing choice vouchers; in fiscal year 2023, the city <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dcfpi.org\/all\/whats-in-the-fiscal-year-2023-budget\/\">allocated <\/a>about $14 million for additional subsidies.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cVouchers are a good thing. And right now we need them because we don\u2019t have a better way to supplement people\u2019s income\u2026especially in really hot rental markets like Washington, D.C.,\u201d Golding says. \u201cThat said, we would be remiss to not think about the overall effect of vouchers [on the rental market] and how that impacts these business models\u2026we should really be thinking about enforcement and good oversight, to make sure that there aren\u2019t bad actors who take advantage of tenants in precarious financial situations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet it has proved unwieldy to manage D.C.\u2019s decentralized pool of subsidized apartments.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982573\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4982573 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/221208_Housing_Spotlight_04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">According to lawsuits and interviews with more than a half-dozen tenants across four properties, Razjooyan has left many of the tenants in the properties he\u2019s flipping living in abject squalor. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Despite multiple legal complaints alleging poor maintenance or illegal construction, dozens of letters detailing property code compliance issues, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines levied by D.C.\u2019s own housing inspectors, buildings managed by Razjooyan continue to house low-income renters.<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s far from the only one looking to cash in on the city\u2019s subsidized housing programs: DCist\/WAMU has identified nine real estate companies that target rent-stabilized apartment buildings for redevelopment, marketing them toward renters in the Housing Choice Voucher Program. From Mount Pleasant to Congress Heights, developers are turning the scarcity of deeply affordable homes into a profit opportunity, making the most vulnerable citizens compete with one another for a precious resource \u2014 and in the process, eroding the city\u2019s stock of affordable housing. Golding believes that hundreds, if not thousands, of naturally-occurring, deeply affordable apartments are lost to this business model every year.<\/p>\n<p>The DC Housing Authority, which manages the Housing Choice Voucher Program, has struggled to administer its most basic programs in compliance with federal regulations. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, DCHA\u2019s parent agency, found in a Sept. 2022 report that DCHA <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-10\/DCReview_Final%209302022%20%281%29.pdf\">overpays property managers<\/a> who rent to housing choice voucher holders, and that its executives have demonstrated \u201cinadequate management and knowledge of HCV program functions.\u201d DCHA Director Brenda Donald has since committed to creating a standard for \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hud.gov\/sites\/dfiles\/PIH\/documents\/HCV_Guidebook_Rent_Reasonableness.pdf\">rent reasonableness<\/a>\u201d \u2013 a metric that HUD requires public housing authorities to use, and which determines how much those authorities will pay landlords for rent.<\/p>\n<p>But one policy expert who works in affordable housing development, who requested anonymity to speak freely about conversations with D.C. officials, tells DCist\/WAMU that for at least three years they have raised concerns to DCHA executives about how voucher overpayments have encouraged predatory development practices.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><strong>DCHA\u2019s turbulent history<\/strong>The DC Housing Authority is one of the largest housing providers in D.C., managing both the city\u2019s public housing complexes and many of its voucher programs. But allegations of corruption and program mismanagement have plagued the agency for years.<\/p>\n<p>From 1994-2000, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/78905\/how-has-privatization-of-public-housing-fared-in-dc\">federal government took control<\/a> of DCHA (a structure known as \u201creceivership\u201d) because of improper financial practices and pervasive housing conditions issues.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, scandal after scandal has eroded residents\u2019 trust in its operations. Former board chairman Neil Albert resigned after commissioners discovered he <a href=\"https:\/\/districtdig.com\/2021\/10\/06\/gilding-the-lily\/\">gave millions of dollars\u2019 worth of lucrative city contracts<\/a> to his romantic partner; Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s most recent nominee to lead the agency, Brenda Donald, <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/21\/08\/13\/dc-housing-authority-board-authorizes-two-year-contract-for-interim-director-brenda-donald\/\">has never worked<\/a> in housing development; and the District\u2019s own attorney general \u2013 who <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/blog\/dc-housing-authority-failing-residents-heres-how\">referred to<\/a> DCHA as the city\u2019s \u201cbiggest slumlord\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/09\/30\/dc-public-housing-authority-safety-violence-lawsuit-2019-notices\/\">sued the agency<\/a> twice in two years over its failure to maintain safe housing for residents.<\/p>\n<\/aside>\n<p>As DCHA weighs how to improve its administration of vouchers, developers continue to leverage the program for big payouts.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At 4001 St., Razjooyan\u2019s tenants still live in a never-ending construction zone. For nearly a year, Razjooyan\u2019s team erected new walls to create additional bedrooms, converting studios into 2-bedroom units and junior 1-bedrooms into 3-bedroom units. There was drilling from dawn to dusk, tenants say, causing walls to vibrate so violently that their framed artwork and shelves would fall to the floor, dust swirling in a flurry through the central stairwell. Three residents of the building tell DCist\/WAMU that the construction crews didn\u2019t erect tarps to contain the dust and debris, and Hunter, who has asthma, says he could barely breathe when he walked through the building.<\/p>\n<p>Desiree Williams, a 30-year-old mother of three who lives in a renovated three-bedroom unit on the top floor of 4001 1st St. SE, says she\u2019s seen some of the vacant one-unit apartments that Razjooyan\u2019s team hadn\u2019t yet flipped. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the one-bedroom. It\u2019s the same size as my unit. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got more walls,\u201d Williams says. \u201c[My bedrooms] are very small. I could fit, like, a refrigerator in here.\u201d Williams pays more than $1900 in rent for her unit with the help of another subsidy program. (She says she moved into the building in May 2020 and has been \u201ctrying to get out of here since May 2020,\u201d thanks to poor housing conditions).<\/p>\n<p>By the winter of 2022, a year after his friend John had been forced out of the building by poor conditions, Hunter\u2019s own apartment was in such disrepair \u2013 his climate systems on the fritz, water damage growing by the week and appliances that kept breaking \u2013 that he feared the worst when an inspector from the D.C. government arrived to look at it and called it uninhabitable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had to beg him not to condemn the apartment,\u201d Hunter says, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>II.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Razjooyan was only in his twenties when began flipping homes for a living, but he likes to present himself as a Renaissance man, former business associates say: To colleagues, he has claimed to have been a male model, a prospective medical student at Howard University, and a researcher at the National Institutes of Health. His entrepreneurial endeavors have run the gamut, from a now-defunct restaurant on the ground floor of the French Embassy in Washington to an automobile dealership on Evarts St. NE.

His approach is consistent, typically seeking silent partners to finance the down payment for a property and construction loan while he serves as the general contractor and contract purchaser.<\/p>\n<p>Yet Razjooyan has burned bridges with the people financing his endeavors as they\u2019ve learned he\u2019s largely uninterested in hewing to the letter of the law, two lawsuits filed against Razjooyan by former business partners allege.<\/p>\n<p>One of those suits, filed by a father-son duo investing in a remodel of buildings on 31st St SE and Wayne Place SE \u2013 at least one of which rented to a voucher program participant for more than $2,200 per month as recently as last year \u2013 characterized Razjooyan\u2019s behavior as \u201ca made-for-television story of intentional deception and criminal conduct.\u201d (Razjooyan and the plaintiffs settled the case.)<\/p>\n<p>In a separate project, court documents say, Razjooyan worked with another investor to embark on a large project: buying, remodeling, and leasing out two investment properties in D.C. Through mutual contacts, he knew of a couple living in Virginia, Ron and June Broadwell, who wanted to make a smart investment that could help fast-track their retirement. As the couple would allege in a 2017 lawsuit they filed in D.C. Superior Court against Razjooyan (and his mother, his close friend, and his wife), the plan soon proved disastrous.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pullquote pull-right\">[He] came up with the idea of renting the property to the DC Housing Authority to maximize rental income and to create a stable revenue stream.<\/p>\n<p>Per his own recounting of their arrangement in court, Razjooyan promised the couple that if they provided a down payment to buy the properties and secure construction loans \u2013 for a duplex on Victor Street N.W. and an apartment complex on 51st Street, N.E. \u2013 he would take care of everything else, from finalizing the purchases to overseeing construction and managing the buildings.<\/p>\n<p>Razjooyan also planned, his attorney told the court in 2018, on moving existing tenants out of the building and finding voucher tenants to move in. \u201c[He] came up with the idea of renting the property to the D.C. Housing Authority to maximize rental income and to create a stable revenue stream,\u201d his attorney wrote to the court.<\/p>\n<p>In his initial business plan, the Broadwells say in their suit, Razjooyan also proposed adding more bedrooms to existing units at the 51st Street properties. This could get them dramatically higher rent payments from the government, which calculates its rental caps based on the number of bedrooms in an apartment, not the square footage. A landlord leasing a 500-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms in Brightwood, for example, could command $2,400 for that unit, while a studio of the same size would get only $1,300.<\/p>\n<p>Housing contracts between the DC Housing Authority and the LLC that owns the 51st St. building, obtained by DCist\/WAMU, show that the city has rented units there to low-income tenants at rates of up to $1,900 a month.<\/p>\n<p>The Broadwells would ultimately allege that Razjooyan embezzled $150,000 in rental income from the 51st Street properties for his own benefit; charged at least $100,000 in personal expenses to their personal credit cards; and performed \u201cconstruction so illegal and shoddy that [D.C.] has ordered much of it to be torn down in what it has described as one of the most egregious violations ever seen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The couple alleged further that Razjooyan used between $300,000 and $500,000 in construction loans to expand his burgeoning real-estate empire. (In a filing with DC Superior Court, Razjooyan called the claim that he took $500,000 in construction funds \u201cpatently false\u201d and said that \u201can unfortunate series of events, perpetuated by the Plaintiffs\u2019 interference, have delayed construction progress.\u201d He also settled with the Broadwells; DCist\/WAMU\u2019s requests for comment from their lawyers went unanswered.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Razjooyan kept adding to his real estate portfolio, maintaining a growing list of property\u2019 addresses on a whiteboard in the back of his 51st Street office, the Broadwells say, like trophies in a display case.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982574\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4982574\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/221208_Housing_Spotlight_05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">A window into a unit at 4001 1st Street SE, one of dozens of apartment buildings tied to Razjooyan throughout the city. <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But it\u2019s difficult to track them.<\/p>\n<p>Chief Operating Officer Rachel M. Joseph tells DCist\/WAMU that the agency\u2019s records \u201cdo not reflect any landlords\u201d under the name Sam Razjooyan, although DCist\/WAMU separately obtained housing contracts between LLCs governed by Razjooyan and the agency.<\/p>\n<p>DCist\/WAMU asked the DC Housing Authority whether it has a mechanism in place to prevent it from executing Housing Choice Voucher Program contracts with developers like Razjooyan, who have a scattered history of managing buildings with documented code violations. DCHA\u2019s Joseph said only that DCHA conducts an inspection prior to any participant moving into a new unit, and that it \u201c[doesn\u2019t] have any direct information\u201d about whether there are outstanding fines for housing code violations.<\/p>\n<p>While the housing authority has drafted extensive new contract procurement guidelines that lay out when it can stop doing business with poor performing contractors, those guidelines <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dchousing.org\/api\/files\/board\/5yngl4bz_pk10jbum19110omt2z2191.pdf\">don\u2019t appear to apply<\/a> to the kinds of contracts that landlords execute with housing choice voucher recipients. Instead, those landlords are subject to local contracting regulations, like D.C.\u2019s \u201cClean Hands\u201d mandate, which stipulates that agencies \u2013 including DCHA \u2013 deny licenses or contracts to those who owe debts of more than $100 to the city.<\/p>\n<p>But because business operators often create single-purpose LLCs to manage property acquisitions \u2013 a way to reflect changing rotations of investors involved in any given real estate project \u2013 it\u2019s possible for property managers with poor performance histories to evade meaningful scrutiny from regulators. (Under a law that went into effect in 2020, business owners are required to register the names of most partners with D.C.\u2019s business licensing agency, but that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/washington\/news\/2020\/01\/28\/d-c-law-requiring-identification-of-individuals.html\">doesn\u2019t always happen<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>At 4305 Wheeler Road SE, emails from Razjooyan to DCHA executives show he has solicited the agency to lease all 42 units to voucher holders. The LLC that owns the building, registered to Razjooyan\u2019s home address, owes more than $26,235 in fines for housing-code violations on the four-building complex.<\/p>\n<p>The same is true for three other newly \u201crenovated\u201d buildings that Razjooyan is trying to lease to the Housing Authority: As of mid-January 2023, LLCs tied to Razjooyan have been assessed at least $21,000 in fines for an 11-unit apartment building at 4480 C Street, S.E.; more than $57,400 for a sprawling apartment complex at 4559-4569 Benning Road S.E.; and, as of Feb. 2022 at least $25,400 in fines for a 12-unit apartment at 5058 Astor Place, S.E. (Joseph says there are currently two units active in the housing choice voucher program across these buildings.)<\/p>\n<p>Razjooyan provided no comment on the fines assessed to these LLCs. In an email to DCist\/WAMU, Razjooyan says that \u201cout of the properties I have an interest in, their purchase was from owner\/operators who have had long standing issues maintaining the properties, leading them to bankruptcy and receivership. These properties needed extensive renovation at a considerable expense, but over time, and with significant effort, the condition of these properties have greatly improved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>III.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DCist\/WAMU has identified nine real estate businesses cashing in on this business model, using buyouts to clear rent-stabilized apartment buildings of existing tenants, then explicitly soliciting voucher holders in public marketing materials; most have acquired between three and nine buildings each.<\/p>\n<p>Anita Ballantyne, a program manager at Housing Counseling Services \u2013 a local organization that receives money from the D.C. government to help mediate the sale of apartment buildings under the <a href=\"https:\/\/ota.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/dc\/sites\/ota\/publication\/attachments\/TOPA%20-%205%20or%20More%20Units%20%28FINAL%29.pdf\">Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act<\/a> \u2013 says that while this business model is nothing new, it has become appreciably more common in recent years. Developers who use this business model have represented the \u201cvast majority\u201d of TOPA cases her organization has managed in the last year, she says.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><strong>Why buyouts don\u2019t always help tenants<\/strong>Though some buyout offers appear lucrative on paper, they often serve as a source of tension for tenants left to make unsavory choices. $30,000 or even $50,000 sounds like a lot of money until you start doing the math: The average apartment in D.C. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rentcafe.com\/average-rent-market-trends\/us\/dc\/washington\/\">costs<\/a> nearly $2,400, which tops $28,800 per year. Should renters trade a permanently rent-stabilized apartment for one year\u2019s worth of housing payments?<\/p>\n<p>Even those offers are often contingent on the majority of a building\u2019s tenants agreeing to taking the buyout, pitting tenants against each other in a different way. \u201cSome tenants might say, \u2018you know what? I\u2019m trying to get out anyway. This building is falling apart, the landlord has refused to make repairs for years and years, I have kids with asthma, I\u2019m getting out \u2013 if I can get $50,000 and move to Virginia, fine, I\u2019m gonna do it,\u2019\u201d says Eliana Golding, the analyst at DC Fiscal Policy Institute. \u201cAnd some tenants are thinking, \u2018actually, living close to my kids\u2019 school, to the amenities, to my family, all of these things are really worth it to me, and I\u2019m going to fight it out. And I\u2019m gonna stay here and not accept a buyout.\u2019 And there can be real tensions that emerge [among] tenants of the same building.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/aside>\n<p>In marketing materials for a complex on 63rd St. NE in Deanwood, provided to DCist\/WAMU by someone with access who asked to remain anonymous, executives from real estate agency Greysteel boast: \u201cValue-Add Opportunity: The Property offers new ownership the ability to raise rents by leasing units to the Housing Choice Voucher Program tenants upon turnover. Current rents can grow upwards of 50%.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another flier issued by an agent at Greysteel for a 12-unit building on Irving St. NE offers: \u201cNew ownership can continue the reconfiguring of two bedrooms to three bedroom units. HCVP rates for three bedrooms \u2026 are $2,628.\u201d Yet another, for an apartment complex in Hill East for sale by Marcus &amp; Millichap, says: \u201cThe current gross potential income is approximately $13,500 per month with rents over 50% below nearby renovated one-bedroom market-rate units. The property\u2026features the city\u2019s highest voucher rates for one-bedroom units, $2,467 (tenant pays utilities), and $2,648 (owner pays utilities).\u201d Spokespeople for Greysteel and Marcus &amp; Millichap didn\u2019t return DCist\/WAMU\u2019s requests for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Developers have also targeted major commercial areas in Ward 1 like Georgia Avenue NW and Park Road NW. (In the course of reporting this story, real estate company District Growth acquired my old apartment building on Park Road NW., offering tenants $32,500 buyouts; several seniors who spent their adult lives there ultimately moved out.)<\/p>\n<p>In a phone call with DCist\/WAMU, Adam Lobene, a partner of District Growth, says he believes this business model solves housing problems, giving developers a financially viable way to renovate often-dilapidated buildings. Because D.C.\u2019s TOPA law allows tenants to weigh in on who buys their building and what benefits they\u2019d like to see from a sale, \u201cthe system is working pretty well for tenants that are in there,\u201d Lobene says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can only speak for my experience, but the buildings we\u2019ve been purchasing, most have been in disrepair. The tenants don\u2019t want to live in those buildings \u2026 and they\u2019re looking for a better solution,\u201d Lobene says. He says his company is investing $11 million in the renovation of its building on Park Road, which it ultimately plans on marketing to renters with and without housing vouchers. \u201cTenants are the ones dictating how the process goes. [And] in order to renovate a building and bring it up to code and make it livable for everybody, it requires an investment.\u201d (Lobene says District Growth as an entity has effectively dissolved, and that some of its operations will continue under the name American Housing.)<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4982581\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4982581\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2023\/03\/0C2A5619.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Trash littered outside a building tied to Razjooyan at 4305 Wheeler Rd, SE <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Many of these companies are offering tenants in newly acquired buildings staggering sums to move out, an indication of how much they believe the units could be worth long term using this business model. One source with knowledge of a building sale on Colorado Avenue, who requested anonymity to speak freely about it, says that two such companies \u2013 Petra Development and DC Nachito \u2013 engaged in a bidding war with tenants over buyout offers. Tenants ultimately accepted Nachito\u2019s $70,000 buyouts to vacate the building in exchange for purchasing rights, according to the source.<\/p>\n<p>Petra is now selling the entirety of its 11-building portfolio; a slide deck advertising the deal, obtained by DCist\/WAMU, notes that \u201ctenancy throughout the portfolio is exclusively through the Housing Choice Voucher Program.\u201d Spokespeople for Petra and DC Nachito did not return DCist\/WAMU\u2019s requests for comment.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate effect of this buyout-voucher model is, counterintuitively, to diminish the city\u2019s supply of rent-stabilized, affordable housing: D.C. loses one more unit of affordable housing for every voucher used to pay someone\u2019s way in a rent stabilized building, for as long as that tenant chooses to live there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something inherently nonsensical in [this] \u2013 taking all of our older, rent controlled, naturally occurring affordable housing stock in the city, and allowing a system that takes those tenants and puts them back in the housing market looking for [other] affordable housing, so that we can house voucher holders,\u201d Ballantyne says.<\/p>\n<p>The mechanisms meant to incentivize property managers to rent to voucher holders \u2013 an attempt to counter the very <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/10\/20\/dc-real-estate-companies-pay-fine-voucher-discrimination\/\">real and pervasive discrimination against them<\/a> \u2013 end up multiplying the harm.<\/p>\n<p>The chief executive of a Michigan-based real estate investment firm, Red Oak Capital Holdings, described the business model in detail during a 2022 real estate conference, noting that the model is enticing specifically because of the additional revenue that investors can recoup from high voucher reimbursement rates. \u201cD.C., from what we\u2019ve seen, is the best at this program,\u201d the executive, Gary Bechdel, said. \u201cThey have the most money.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Developers take buildings that rent \u201cat fairly low [levels]\u2026 and then re-letting those through the DC Housing Authority\u2019s program at higher rents, thereby creating a substantial increase in the value,\u201d Bechdel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great structure for a developer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He added: \u201cAs soon as the [redevelopment] is completed, they go to the DC Housing Authority, which has a waiting list of roughly 10,000 families that are waiting for these units, and they\u2019re literally full the next day. I mean, it\u2019s a phenomenal program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>DCHA Director Brenda Donald defended the agency\u2019s voucher payment practices as recently as last year. It wasn\u2019t until a Washington Post story found that the agency<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/investigations\/2023\/02\/15\/dc-housing-authority-overpays-landlords\/\"> spends vastly more money on its vouchers<\/a> than market rate dictates that Donald acknowledged DCHA\u2019s overpayments, telling the paper, \u201cWe are going to fix all of this.\u201d A spokesperson for HUD confirmed to DCist\/WAMU that the agency \u201cwill require DCHA to repay, from non-federal sources, any federal funds that were expended by DCHA in violation of federal regulations or laws.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The attempt to wrangle this problem comes as the DC Housing Authority faces yet another crisis of confidence, sparked by a Sept. 2022 report from HUD that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2022\/11\/27\/dcha-prepares-for-hud-deadline\/\">characterized the agency<\/a> as having the worst public housing occupancy rate in the country, among other management and program administration issues.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the Executive Office of the Mayor wrote in an emailed statement to DCist\/WAMU that \u201cOur vision for DCHA is that it functions properly to provide residents with safe, dignified, and affordable housing \u2013 not just in moments of crisis or after years of waiting, but as part of our regular housing continuum. The purpose of <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/12\/20\/dc-council-approves-emergency-legislation-replacing-dcha-board\/\">creating a streamlined reform board<\/a> was to ensure that DCHA is better equipped to address the issues raised by HUD in the short-term and to set the agency up for success in the long-term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The DCHA board\u2019s new structure, the spokesperson said, allows the agency \u201cto move quickly to offer housing to people on the waitlist and to address other issues flagged by HUD. It is our expectation that these updates are not part of a temporary blitz of improvements for the agency, but a permanent shift in the expectations and operations of DCHA.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><strong>What HUD found in its audit<\/strong>The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development published <a href=\"https:\/\/oag.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-10\/DCReview_Final%209302022%20%281%29.pdf\">a scathing report<\/a> of the DC Housing Authority in Sept. 2022 after a 7-month audit of the agency\u2019s practices. It found serious fault with five of the agency\u2019s core functions, all of which contribute to what HUD characterized as a failure to comply with (or direct violation of) program requirements. The violations included inadequate knowledge of property management and the housing voucher program, as well as failure to \u201cprovide decent, safe, and sanitary housing\u201d for its residents.<\/p>\n<\/aside>\n<p>But questions remain about HUD\u2019s ability or willingness to keep DCHA on a tight leash. A report published in early March by HUD\u2019s inspector general dinged the federal agency\u2019s oversight of local voucher programs, concluding that, across the country, HUD \u201clacked assurance that [public housing authorities\u2019 housing choice vouchers] met their intended objectives, which include assisting the maximum number of eligible families with obtaining affordable and decent rental units at the correct subsidy cost.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ousted DC Housing Authority board member Bill Slover told DCist\/WAMU that he asked a HUD executive last year why the DC Housing Authority was still classified as a high performing agency with a status called \u201cMoving to Work,\u201d which allows well managed public housing authorities to use HUD funding in more flexible ways.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTheir response was, \u2018Yeah, well, if we took your designation off, we\u2019d have to put you on the road to receivership tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Slover recalls, referencing the term for a federal takeover of the agency. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a crazy response. That was a year ago. And so here we are a year later: The same metrics exist. The same occupancy rate; the same rent collection rate; the same major metrics that they use to measure other agencies. None of those have improved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response to a list of questions about HUD\u2019s oversight of the DC Housing Authority, a spokesperson for the agency said only that it \u201ccontinues to work with DCHA to address the findings, recommendations and observations\u201d from its report, and that if it fails to comply with the corrective actions, \u201cHUD has a number of enforcement actions available.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amid that turmoil, DCHA\u2019s inertia in reigning in its spending on vouchers has allowed predation of rent stabilized buildings to flourish, and the pull to redevelop them is so strong that money is flowing in from other states to do so. Some of Razjooyan\u2019s larger acquisitions were made with the help of national real-estate finance companies that specifically target multifamily properties in low-income neighborhoods.<\/p>\n<p>Red Oak, for example, financed a $3 million acquisition of the 14-unit Chesapeake Apartments in January 2021, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redoakcapitalholdings.com\/capital_press_releas\/red-oak-funds-washington-d-c-apartment-renovation-planned-for-dcha-conversion\/\">stated goal<\/a> of doing business with the DC Housing Authority\u2019s housing choice voucher program. (The mortgage designates the borrower as 400 Chesapeake St LLC, with Razjooyan signing for the LLC.)<\/p>\n<p>Months later, Red Oak provided nearly $10 million to <a href=\"http:\/\/pdf.secdatabase.com\/1122\/0001654954-21-010274.pdf\">finance <\/a>the purchase of the complex on Wheeler Road; according to emails sent by Razjooyan to program directors at the DC Housing Authority and obtained by DCist\/WAMU, he has since discussed leasing the building out to the agency. A spokesperson for Red Oak declined to comment on the company\u2019s transactions or relationship with Razjooyan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a borrower for whom we have closed multiple transactions and we are confident in their ability to expand the asset via a conversion to three-bedrooms,\u201d a Red Oak Capital press release announcing the Chesapeake deal said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IV.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Rashida Dinkins\u2019 300-square-foot basement efficiency, directly underneath Andre Hunter at 4001 1st Street, S.E., smoke still hangs in the air.<\/p>\n<p>For 11 years the apartment has been a small refuge for the 47-year-old D.C. native, who pays $480 a month for it and ekes out a living as an Uber driver.

Some did, leaving Razjooyan\u2019s contractors free to undertake construction work on the 55-year-old building. Others, like Hunter, stayed, knowing that they\u2019d never be able to find another apartment in the District for a comparable price \u2014 $450 a month for his efficiency, less than a quarter of the $2,000 average cost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zumper.com\/rent-research\/washington-dc\">for an apartment of that size<\/a> in D.C.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pull-right pullquote\">I told him he would never live like this.

Her repeated calls to Razjooyan\u2019s emergency maintenance line went unanswered.<\/p>\n<p>After the fire came a flood. On a Monday in the last week of February 2022, she noticed brown water rising up from her toilet and tub. Over the course of the day, it slowly climbed to the rim of the bowl, and by the time she woke up on Tuesday, gallons of sewage were flowing into her bathroom\u2014just feet from her bed\u2014and spilling into the rest of the carpeted unit. Frantically ringing the property manager at 9:30 a.m. for a plumber, Dinkins says that nobody showed up to help her until well into the evening. Shortly after a maintenance man arrived, she says, he told her that he needed to leave to get a drink and a cigarette; he never came back.<\/p>\n<p>With the help of a friend, she mopped up the fecal water in her apartment, then spent days scrubbing feces from her closet and walls. She was, she says, on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.<\/p>\n<p>Razjooyan\u2019s proposed solution was to move her into his 51st St. apartment, but Dinkins says that she\u2019s heard awful things about the conditions there, too, from the maintenance workers who come to both buildings.

Housing Authority finds agency failing on many levels","content":"<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/10\/10\/dc-dcha-federal-audit\/\">scathing audit<\/a> about the state of public housing in D.C. The audit found that D.C.\u2019s Housing Authority has failed in some of its most basic responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>The audit identified 82 areas where the Housing Authority is falling short. It includes everything from being out of compliance with federal regulations on pets in public housing to being unable to prevent crime at public housing developments.<\/p>\n<p>The most damning revelations have to do with the 8,000 units of public housing the agency manages, though. Auditors found that the Housing Authority isn\u2019t doing basic upkeep on many of those units, and in many cases doesn\u2019t even know how many are vacant or leased up at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, HUD found that the Housing Authority has a vacancy rate of almost 25 percent, the highest of any big city in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The waiting list for public housing in D.C. is currently about 40,000 people deep. But the list was closed to new applicants in 2013. When it closed, the wait time for a one-bedroom apartment was 28 years.<\/p>\n<p>But the broader point is that there is a huge need for housing in D.C., especially for low-income residents and families. The HUD audit found that the Housing Authority just wasn\u2019t doing much to keep the now-closed waitlist updated, or actually move people off of it.<\/p>\n<p>The D.C. Housing Authority is federally funded and mostly run independently of the D.C. government. It\u2019s overseen by a 13-person board, of which seven of the members are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council. The authority is headed by Brenda Donald. She&#8217;s been in the executive director job since June 2021 and says she was aware of a lot of the problems outlined in the audit, and that she&#8217;s been working to address them. But, she adds, that is going to take more time.<\/p>\n<p>Donald has a little less than 2 months to formally respond to the audit and spell out what she\u2019s doing to address the 82 deficiencies that HUD identified. In the meantime, some D.C. lawmakers say they\u2019ll push to fully overhaul the agency and appoint a whole new board.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The audit identified 82 areas where the Housing Authority is falling short.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/22\/10\/13\/listen-scathing-federal-audit-of-d-c-housing-authority-finds-agency-failing-on-many-levels\/","currentSlug":"listen-scathing-federal-audit-of-d-c-housing-authority-finds-agency-failing-on-many-levels","created":"2022-10-13T08:57:59","modified":"2022-10-13T15:27:33","time":"Oct 13, 2022","timestamp":1665651479,"timestampGMT":1665665879,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Thousands of units of public housing across D.C. are in a state of disrepair, leaving low-income residents at risk.<\/p>\n","description":{"rendered":"<p class=\"attachment\"><a href='https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1.jpeg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"},"altText":"","width":768,"height":512,"sizes":{"medium":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg 600w"},"thumbnail":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-150x150.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x300.jpeg 300w"},"ratio11":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-150x150.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x300.jpeg 300w"},"ratio112x":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x300.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-150x150.jpeg 150w"},"ratio43Small":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x450.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x450.jpeg 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x225.jpeg 300w"},"ratio43Smallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x225.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x450.jpeg 600w"},"ratioOriginalSmall":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg 300w"},"ratioOriginalSmallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg 600w"},"full":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1.jpeg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/park-morton-1500x1000-768x512-1-600x400.jpeg 600w"}},"provider":"WAMU","producer":"Tyrone Turner","source_url":false},"postMeta":{"person":"4242320,13","secondaryImage":{"type":"","data":""},"titleOverride":false,"urlOrigin":false,"provider":"WAMU"},"audio":{"audioTitle":"Listen: Scathing federal audit of D.C.

On Monday, Bowser (who is in the midst of running for a third term) took things a step further and announced that she has accepted <a href=\"https:\/\/dmped.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/dc\/sites\/dmped\/page_content\/attachments\/BHSF%20Report%20102022%20FINAL.pdf\">her Black ownership strike force&rsquo;s recommendation<\/a>&nbsp; of working to create 20,000 new Black homeowners citywide by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that we want to add more homes,&rdquo; said Bowser at an event at Howard Theater. &ldquo;But we also want to be intentional about making sure more people can afford those.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Just 34% of Black residents own their home, a 12 point drop from the 46% Black homeownership rate in 2005, <a href=\"https:\/\/dmped.dc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/dc\/sites\/dmped\/page_content\/attachments\/BHSF%20Report%20102022%20FINAL.pdf\">according<\/a> to a report from various housing experts convened by the mayor. Meanwhile, homeownership has increased for white residents over that same time period, hovering around 49%. D.C. has also seen a decline in Black residents over that time,<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/01\/14\/this-gif-shows-how-the-d-c-areas-demographics-have-changed-since-1970\/\"> falling to 49.2 percent by 2011 according to the D.C. Policy Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4966185\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 708px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4966185\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-2022-10-03-133029.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-2022-10-03-133029-300x281.png 300w, https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/10\/Screenshot-2022-10-03-133029-600x563.png 600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"708\" height=\"664\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Screenshot from mayor&rsquo;s strike force report.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&ldquo;The combination of redlining, racial covenants, and discrimination in lending that barred Black residents from the government-backed mortgages available to white families deprived D.C.&rsquo;s remaining Black households of the economic gain homeownership can bring,&rdquo; the report says. &ldquo;These early policies continue to have reverberating effects.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The average household income for white locals is three times that of Black locals, putting them further out of reach of homeownership &mdash; a vicious cycle because that&rsquo;s a form of wealth building. The report by the mayor&rsquo;s so-called Black Homeownership Strike Force &mdash; created earlier this year and led by Interim Director of the Office of Planning Anita Cozart and Senior Minister of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ Rev. Graylan Scott Hagler &mdash; identified limited financing and preparedness, as well as a lack of housing supply and risks of maintaining one&rsquo;s home, as the main challenges facing Black renters who are interested in buying.<\/p>\n<p>The strike force also identified various ways D.C. could increase Black homeownership, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leverage the city&rsquo;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2022\/04\/01\/bowser-black-homeowner\/\">$10 million fund aimed at increasing Black homeownership<\/a> by creating a public-private fund similar to the Housing Production Trust Fund and reserving some units for Black homebuyers.<\/li>\n<li>Identify ways to accelerate zoning and permitting for homeownership projects, particularly those where units are at or below 80% of the median family income.<\/li>\n<li>Pass legislation to protect homeowners against unwanted solicitation with regard to the sale or potential purchase of their homes, as well as&nbsp;legislation that reduces the impact of housing speculators and establishes a requirement that investors disclose more information like permits used and renovation costs to homebuyers.<\/li>\n<li>Aid experienced Black homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to their inability to pay mortgage or other housing fees.<\/li>\n<li>Consider financial incentives like tax saving and reduced fees to promote the transfers of ownership between Black homeowners and their heirs.<\/li>\n<li>Convene government agencies that provide home ownership aid to coordinate their program offerings, and have those agencies broaden the awareness of existing programs like by creating a comprehensive online platform.<\/li>\n<li>Increase effectiveness of homeownership programs like automating the Home Purchase Assistance Program application process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The strike force decided on 20,000 new Black homeowners in part to stem the exodus of the 5,000 Black homeowners between 2010 and 2020 and on national goals set. The goal was the subject of various meetings and public engagement efforts, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>The city has a number of programs that help local homeowners like Home Purchase Assistance Program, Employer Assisted Housing Program, and DC Open Doors, which are featured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontdoor.dc.gov\/\">on a website called Front Door<\/a> aimed to help residents navigate resources. The strike force called on more investment into these programs. Bowser <a href=\"https:\/\/wtop.com\/dc\/2022\/08\/dc-will-offer-up-to-202000-to-some-families-looking-to-buy-a-home\/\">already announced that her administration would increase<\/a> the loan available for prospective homeowners under the Home Purchase Assistance Program beginning October from $80,000 to $202,000, with an additional $4,000 in closing cost assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Some housing advocates have already expressed concerns about meeting the ambitious goal. D.C. allowed foreclosures to proceed again starting last Friday, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LegalAidDC\/status\/1575197796306587648\">Legal Aid Society of D.C. is concerned<\/a> that some homeowners will be displaced while the D.C. government considers their application for federal funds. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to meet our goal of increasing the overall rate of Black homeownership without preserving current homeowners,&rdquo; Shirley Horng, the senior staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society of D.C., <a href=\"https:\/\/washingtoncitypaper.com\/article\/573389\/d-c-could-soon-allow-a-flood-of-foreclosures-even-though-it-still-has-federal-relief-cash-to-hand-out\/\">told the Washington City Paper<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Coverage:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/22\/04\/25\/tasharn-richardson-dc-house-flip\/\">D.C.

bungalow in Congress Heights last summer \u2014 her first home purchase, after living in public housing her entire life. When her family unloaded the moving truck on a bright day in June, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/06\/25\/1009630841\/a-black-white-housing-gap-persists-but-one-d-c-woman-persevered-and-won\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an NPR reporter was there to document the big day<\/a>. Richardson\u2019s kids ran through the house squealing with excitement, taking in the shiny kitchen backsplash and gleaming bathrooms.<\/p>\n<p>The excitement didn\u2019t last.<\/p>\n<p>Richardson began to notice problems with the house weeks after her family moved in. The air conditioning wouldn\u2019t turn on. The dishwasher didn\u2019t work. Her kids\u2019 bedroom doors hung precariously from loose hinges. Electrical outlets caught on fire. Mice streamed in, finding their way inside through holes in the exterior. Water pooled on the kitchen and basement floors. Black mold sprouted in the walls.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947165\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4947165\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_02-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1831\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Tasharn and Lionel Richardson in their basement, where black mold is flourishing and rodents scale the furniture.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947171\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4947171 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_07-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1714\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Lionel Richardson pulls back plyboard, exposing a hole in a bathroom wall.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The 100-year-old property sat vacant for seven years before Richardson purchased it, and her home inspection report revealed a long list of issues. But she says the seller and her realtor assured her that the problems had been fixed before she closed on the $475,000 property.<\/p>\n<p>Less than one year later, the D.C. government employee says she\u2019s spent thousands of dollars on contractors and exterminators. Her husband Lionel traps mice in the basement and conceals mold splotches with plyboard. Richardson says she regularly sends the kids to stay at her mother\u2019s apartment so they can breathe without coughing. She feels heartbroken, frightened \u2014 and ashamed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt took me months to talk about this,\u201d she says, wiping tears from her cheeks. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just the shame of bringing my family here.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947172\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4947172\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_08-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">\u201cIt took me months to talk about this,\u201d says Tasharn Richardson.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Richardson is not alone in her despair.

The city\u2019s attorney general sued a Virginia couple responsible for some of the poor renovations; they were <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/16\/06\/07\/virginia_developer_agrees_to_pay_1_million_for_shoddy_house_flipping_in_dc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordered to pay more than $1 million in restitution<\/a> to homebuyers and they were <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/16\/06\/08\/house-flippers-will-pay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned from selling homes in the city<\/a>.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Richardson\u2019s home on First Street SE was sold to her and renovated by Monir Dellawar, a Virginia-based real estate agent who owns the company Hafiz LLC. Public records show Hafiz LLC has flipped more than 20 houses and condominiums in the city since 2013. According to Richardson, she informed Dellawar last fall about the problems she was having with the house. She says he sent contractors who made minor and incomplete repairs. One worker who turned up to fix her HVAC system left large holes in the wall and never returned, she says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"gallery wamu-slideshow\"><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In an email she shared with WAMU\/DCist, Richardson wrote Dellawar in November saying she would pursue legal action if he didn\u2019t make additional repairs. He wrote back saying he wasn\u2019t obligated to continue work on the house \u2014 she now owned it, after all \u2014 and that most problems with the home were her fault.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe home has been maintained very poorly. The HV\/AC filter hasn\u2019t been changed since you moved in,\u201d Dellawar wrote. \u201cThis threat to take legal action is absolutely unacceptable and shocking after [the work] we have done.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dellawar did not return multiple requests for comment.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947178\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4947178\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Tasharn and Lionel Richardson\u2019s children play in their front yard after returning home from school.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947177\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4947177 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Tasharn Richardson with one of her children. The mother of 10 says she takes her kids to their grandmother\u2019s apartment so they can escape poor air quality in their home.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Richardson acknowledges she has much to learn about caring for a house, but she says issues with the property go deeper than a lack of basic maintenance. She points to a light fixture above her bathroom sink. It\u2019s falling out of the drywall, but Richardson says no one in the house has touched the light. Most of her children aren\u2019t even tall enough to reach it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI came from public housing. Wear and tear with children is expected. But none of our doors fell apart. None of our door knobs fell off. None of my bathroom fixtures fell apart,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to go through that there, so I didn\u2019t see it coming after buying a new home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her experience is echoed by a woman in Shipley Terrace who purchased a house from Dellawar in 2018. The homeowner, who asked WAMU\/DCist to withhold her name to protect her privacy, says she has been plagued by persistent leaks from her roof. The home\u2019s original real estate listing, which is still online, advertised a brand-new roof in addition to other upgrades throughout the home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs the years have gone by, I have so much water damage and leakage,\u201d the homeowner says. \u201cIf they put a new roof on my house, I should not have all this damage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Public records show that Dellawar did not pull any construction permits for the house in Shipley Terrace. A new roof doesn\u2019t necessarily require a permit, according to a Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) spokesperson, but it\u2019s not clear whether other permits may have been required. The city has placed stop work orders on at least three properties renovated by Hafiz LLC \u2014 including Richardson\u2019s house \u2014 citing illegal construction.<\/p>\n<p>Not every house flipped by Hafiz LLC has resulted in unhappy surprises, however: WAMU\/DCist spoke with four buyers in D.C. who said homes they purchased from him appear to be in good condition with no structural issues. He has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zillow.com\/profile\/Monir%20Dellawar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high rating on Zillow<\/a> for his work as a real estate agent, and DCRA says it has not received any \u201cidentifiable complaints\u201d for work his company has overseen, aside from complaints filed by Tasharn Richardson.<\/p>\n<p>Richardson\u2019s situation exemplifies larger problems within D.C.\u2019s bustling renovation market, says Ethan Landis, co-founder of the D.C.- based remodeling firm Landis Architects\/Builders. Some developers cut corners to defray the high cost of doing business in the District, he says, and the city\u2019s DCRA has struggled to crack down on bad actors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDCRA has worked really hard to try to double check inspections \u2026 but as busy as the marketplace is out here, that\u2019s probably a difficult proposition,\u201d Landis says.<\/p>\n<p>A home inspector with more than 15 years of experience in D.C. \u00a0says shoddy house flips sometimes fall under the radar because the city allows developers to select their own third-party inspectors from <a href=\"https:\/\/dcra.dc.gov\/page\/approved-third-party-agencies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a list of approved companies<\/a>. Some of those firms, while technically cleared by the city, are known for being unscrupulous. (The inspector asked DCist\/WAMU to withhold his name because he\u2019s not authorized by his employer to speak with media.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a contractor and you\u2019re aware of a third-party inspector that\u2019s viewed as being less rigorous, you\u2019re likely to contract with that inspector,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t DCRA have a program where they randomly choose the inspector for the contractors, so there isn\u2019t this incentive system in place?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tasharn Richardson\u2019s home underwent two inspections. The first \u2014 the one that uncovered extensive problems with the property \u2014 was required under the terms of the Home Purchase Assistance Program loan she received from the city to help her buy the house. The second, required by the city, was conducted by CamJap, a third-party company hired by Hafiz LLC.<\/p>\n<p>CamJap\u2019s owners did not return requests for comment. A spokesperson for DCRA writes in a statement that the agency reviews and approves each report filed by third-party inspectors such as CamJap, and they haven\u2019t received complaints about the company\u2019s inspections. A public records request for the inspection CamJap completed for Richardson\u2019s home is pending.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947175\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2500px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4947175\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Tasharn and Lionel Richardson say their home has been a constant source of stress for their family.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Richardson feels let down by her real estate agent, whom she says didn\u2019t warn her about potentially major problems with the house, or push for Hafiz LLC to place funds into escrow to cover any needed repairs. The agent, Lee Gochman of Eng Garcia Properties, told WAMU\/DCist in a phone call that he does not want to be linked publicly with the sale of Richardson\u2019s home, but as her agent he already is.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my name associated with that transaction,\u201d Gochman said. \u201cI did everything that I needed to. We got the home inspection done. I brought in structural contractors. I did everything I could to be an ally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gochman adds that as far as he knew, the house was in livable condition when Richardson bought it. He says Dellawar made repairs as needed before the sale closed, and that some problems with the house could be the Richardsons\u2019 fault.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFour months after they moved into the house, they called me out of the blue and said things were going wrong,\u201d Gochman says. \u201cI\u2019m hearing conflicting things from the buyer and from the seller as to how this home was cared for and how it was constructed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Richardson says she stayed quiet about issues with the house because she was embarrassed and assumed everything was her fault. NPR had run a story about her new home, she had scraped together thousands of dollars in financial assistance to buy it, and she had given up a coveted five-bedroom apartment in public housing to move.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven with my husband, I was trying to hide what was going on with the house,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cBut there was no hiding this many issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Richardson says she continues to find hazards around the property. She recently took one of her daughters to the emergency room after the child ripped open her foot on a broken fence pole in their yard. The hospital trip was just the latest in a series of health emergencies brought on by the home\u2019s condition, she says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy son has allergies now because of this,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4947173\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2560px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4947173 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/04\/20220406_Bad_Housing_Turner_09-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\">Tasharn Richardson says she didn\u2019t experience similarly poor conditions while living in public housing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Richardson has worked with the nonprofit A Wider Circle throughout her homebuying experience, and for several years before that.

Today, Diane continues to seek out insightful, well-informed guests who can help her, and her listeners, sift through the noise of the news media to get the answers they need and deserve.<\/p>\r\nFor 37 years, The Diane Rehm Show offered listeners thoughtful and lively conversations on an array of topics with many of the most distinguished people of our times. Each week, 2.8 million listeners across the country tuned in to the program, which grew from a small local morning call-in show on Washington\u2019s WAMU 88.5 to one of public broadcasting\u2019s most-listened-to programs. In Fall 2015 and Spring 2016, the show placed among the top ten most powerful public radio programs, based on its ability to draw listeners to public radio stations. It was the only live call-in talk show on the list. The final live Diane Rehm Show was broadcast on December 23, 2016.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
