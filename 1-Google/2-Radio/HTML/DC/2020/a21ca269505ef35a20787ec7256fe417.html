Attorney General<\/h4>\n<p><em>June 2, 4:08 p.m.: <\/em>Grocery delivery company Instacart will begin allowing its workers to access up to 14 days of paid sick leave if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 or someone they live with tests positive for the disease, says D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine\u2019s office.<\/p>\n<p>As part of an agreement that Instacart and Racine\u2019s office reached after the latter asked the San Francisco-based company to expand eligibility for its extended pay program during the coronavirus pandemic, Instacart will now allow workers who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19\u2014even if they\u2019re not tested but have a diagnosis from a doctor\u2014to take paid leave. Instacart will also provide workers who have symptoms with free telemedicine appointments through Doctors on Demand. The telemedicine option will be piloted in D.C. before being expanded to other places, according to Racine\u2019s office.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring this pandemic, grocery delivery workers are risking their health to connect District residents to essential goods,\u201d Racine says in a press release. \u201cInstacart\u2019s new policy will ensure that workers who are sick can stay home and seek care, and it helps protect their colleagues, consumers, and the public during this crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the District, the company will provide up to 14 days of financial assistance in June to workers whose child\u2019s school or daycare is closed due to the pandemic. \u201cThe assistance will be based on workers\u2019 recent earnings and will be available to active Instacart workers who meet certain conditions,\u201d Racine\u2019s office says. In addition, Instacart will donate $50,000 to the Capital Area Food Bank to help residents facing food insecurity in the crisis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs this pandemic continues to affect our communities, we believe it\u2019s important to expand our offerings to support the ongoing needs of shoppers during this critical time,\u201d says Nilam Ganenthiran, Instacart\u2019s president, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Shoppers for Instacart and other gig-economy platforms such as Shipt, which is owned by Target, have <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/04\/29\/workers-delivering-d-c-s-groceries-face-competition-tip-baiting-and-a-lack-of-ppe\/\">reported<\/a> increased competition from their peers and, in some cases, reduced earnings and insufficient personal protective equipment provided by the platforms. Instacart previously told DCist that it anticipated hiring 36,000 new shoppers in D.C. because of the surge in demand for grocery deliveries during the pandemic. <em>\u2014Andrew Giambrone<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"june2numbers\"><\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4848078\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 931px;\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4848078\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2020\/06\/Screen-Shot-2020-06-02-at-10.59.13-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"921\" height=\"506\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coronavirus data for June 2.<span class=\"credits\">WAMU<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h4>Cases Top 109,000 In D.C., Maryland, And Virginia<\/h4>\n<p><em>June 2, 12:15 p.m.: <\/em>D.C., Virginia, and Maryland reported 62 more COVID-19 deaths this morning, up from the past two days, for a combined toll of 4,474 people.

COVID-19 Cases In Weeks","content":"<p>As the D.C. region continues to see an uptick in the spread of the coronavirus, today Virginia and Maryland both recorded their highest number of new cases in weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland recorded 930 new cases, its highest number since May 30, bringing its total number of cases to 81,766. Virginia, meanwhile, saw 1,127 new cases, the largest caseload since June 7, for a total of 82,364 known infections.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland and Virginia also reported 13 new fatalities, respectively.\u00a0The totals include all confirmed and probable cases and deaths linked to the coronavirus reported by local jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. also saw a significant increase in cases today, reporting 78 new infections, bringing the District\u2019s total to 11,649. That number is nearly double what D.C. reported on Thursday, though it\u2019s lower than the 102 new cases the city saw on Wednesday, its highest case load since June 4.<\/p>\n<p>The District did not record any new deaths related to COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>After declining in early June before largely plateauing, the region has seen an uptick in July, and over the past week alone D.C. has seen a 12% rise in cases, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/local\/dc-maryland-virginia-coronavirus-cases\/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Washington Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At a press conference today, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/24\/bowser-orders-mandatory-quarantine-for-nonessential-travelers-from-high-risk-areas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mandatory self-quarantine for travelers coming from high-risk areas<\/a>. Earlier in the week, Bowser <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/22\/dc-coronavirus-pandemic-order-mandatory-masks-outside\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expanded mask requirements<\/a> in the city, mandating that people wear masks in public with exceptions for eating, drinking and doing \u201cvigorous outdoor exercise,\u201d and some other scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>Officials in Anne Arundel County, Maryland also announced the tightening of some restrictions on<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/23\/maryland-anne-arundel-restaurants-covid19-close\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> dining and social gatherings<\/a> in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The new rules will go into effect on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>The jumps in new cases are the latest in a <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/07\/21\/recent-spikes-coronavirus-dc-region-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">series of spikes in the region<\/a> as infections surge across the country, though experts have said the local numbers aren\u2019t necessarily as concerning as they might seem.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe DMV region has, relative to many areas of the country, been doing really very well when we\u2019re looking at cases, when we\u2019re looking at our positivity rate, when we\u2019re looking at hospitalizations and deaths,\u201d Dr. Melissa Hawkins, the director of the public health scholars program at American University\u2019s department of health studies, told DCist this week. (Disclosure: AU\u00a0holds the license\u00a0for DCist\u2019s parent company,\u00a0WAMU.)<\/p>\n<p>Hawkins noted that other data, like positivity rates, can better indicate how an area is doing. Positivity rates have remained relatively low in D.C., Maryland and Virginia compared to hotspots like Texas and Florida.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a

Last week he unveiled a plan for a phased reopening of the economy, but said that it wouldn\u2019t start until case counts decreased for at least two weeks and testing and contact tracing capacities were increased.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah, Hogan also said that state-by-state reopening plans could be problematic \u2014 especially in the Washington region.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t recognize state borders or international borders. In our area we\u2019re very close with Washington, D.C. and Virginia\u2026 we\u2019re all working in conjunction with one another to make sure that we\u2019re sort of on the same page because many of our people live in one jurisdiction, work in another and they travel back and forth on the same Metro system,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf somebody opens up all the bars and restaurants, everybody from our state will go over there and bring it back.

We were put in a position where governors were scraping and clawing and trying to get tests all over the country from various providers and all over the world,\u201d he said. <em>\u2014Martin Austermuhle<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>More Stories from Wednesday<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Smithsoniancuts\">Smithsonian Cuts Pay For Senior-Level Executives In Response To Revenue Losses<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#mdnursinghometests\">All Maryland Nursing Home Residents And Staff Will Get Tests<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#vasurgery\">Elective Surgery Can Resume In Virginia Friday<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#bowserwednesday\">D.C.

The District awarded $4.2 million to Howard University, roughly $4 million to MedStar Washington Hospital Center and $3.7 million to United Medical Center. Sibley Memorial Hospital will be given about $3.5 million, while Children\u2019s National Hospital will receive about $2 million and MedStar Georgetown University Hospital will get $1.2 million.<\/p>\n<p>Hospitals are set to receive the funding on May 1, which is being allocated based on the number of beds each has available to accommodate a likely uptick in COVID-19 patients.<\/p>\n<p>This funding was included in recent emergency D.C. council legislation to support the District\u2019s response to the pandemic. Money can be used for personnel, supplies and equipment needed to treat patients and the construction of temporary space to be used for testing or treatment.<\/p>\n<p>The D.C. government is also working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to convert the Walter E. Washington Convention Center into an alternate care facility.

It&#8217;s meant to be easier for residents to use because several types of claims can be filed online through one application, including regular benefits, CARES Act benefits and individuals who were previously required to file by phone.<\/p>\n<p>The state already has received more jobless claims this year than it did in all of last year. \u2014<em>Kavitha Cardoza<\/em><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><em>For more on how coronavirus has impacted the D.C. region, see these\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/04\/20\/coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-20\/\">updates from the week of April 20-April 26<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Live updates on how coronavirus is affecting the Washington region.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/27\/coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-27\/","currentSlug":"coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-27","created":"2020-04-27T09:57:23","modified":"2020-05-03T18:30:16","time":"Apr 27, 2020","timestamp":1587981443,"timestampGMT":1587995843,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>The Virginia State Police pulled over one driver going 132 mph on I-95 in Fairfax County.<\/p>\n","description":{"rendered":"<p class=\"attachment\"><a href='https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1.jpg'><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x202.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n"},"altText":"","width":500,"height":336,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-150x150.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-150x150.jpg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x300.jpg 300w"},"medium":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x202.jpg","srcset":""},"ratio11":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-150x150.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-150x150.jpg 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x300.jpg 300w"},"ratio112x":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x300.jpg","srcset":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x300.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-150x150.jpg 150w"},"ratio43Smallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x225.jpg","srcset":""},"ratioOriginalSmallest":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1-300x202.jpg","srcset":""},"full":{"url":"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1.jpg","srcset":""}},"provider":"Shutterstock","producer":false,"source_url":false},"postMeta":{"inCollectionId":5591306,"secondaryImage":{"type":"","data":""},"titleOverride":false,"urlOrigin":false,"provider":"WAMU"},"audio":{"postPermalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/27\/coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-27\/"},"beat":"","beatSlug":"","slug":{"name":"WAMU","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/provider\/wamu\/","categoryName":"","providerClass":"provider-internal","flagSlug":"","flagText":"","nameOverride":"Local News"},"promoted":"","headMeta":{"title":"Coronavirus Latest: Virginia Sees Uptick In New Coronavirus Infections, While Maryland Reports Lowest Count In Weeks | WAMU","description":"Live updates on how coronavirus is affecting the Washington region.","canonical":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/27\/coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-27\/","featured_image":{"url":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/2015_1007_speedingcar-1.jpg","width":500,"height":336},"image":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/wamu-default-og-image.png"},"provider":{"term_id":561,"name":"WAMU","slug":"wamu","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":562,"taxonomy":"wamu_provider","description":"","parent":0,"count":45428,"filter":"raw","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/provider\/wamu\/","nameOverride":"Local News"}},{"ID":5712470,"guid":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/09\/how-close-is-the-d-c-region-to-flattening-the-curve-of-the-coronavirus\/","title":"How Close Is The D.C. Region To Flattening \u2018The Curve\u2019 Of The Coronavirus?","content":"<p>The coronavirus pandemic has not yet hit the Washington region with the same force in which it\u2019s hit other metro areas. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1-dOqXayX9wAQt5XOFyQX8__2VzEVGCy5bGCEmIQuKqI\/edit#gid=1913078281\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth in confirmed cases<\/a> is showing an ominous upturn that some other cities have already experienced. Here\u2019s a quick look at where things stand here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019ve heard so much about \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of confirmed cases and deaths. Where are we on the curve now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Still very much on the upswing. The number of confirmed cases are up sharply this week in Maryland and D.C., and rising only a little more slowly in Virginia. Confirmed cases across the three jurisdictions crossed the <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/06\/coronavirus-latest-week-of-april6\/#covidcases\">10,000 threshold, according to figures reported Wednesday.<\/a><\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h5>Tracking Coronavirus<\/h5>\n<p>Read WAMU&#8217;s ongoing coverage of coronavirus and <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/26\/guide_to_coronavirus_dc_maryland_virginia_testing_cases_schools_transit_resources_help_closures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what you need to know about it<\/a> in the D.C. region.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn-generic\" href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/series\/coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read More<\/a><br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Maryland alone accounted for more than 6,000 in cases reported for Wednesday, about triple the cases from one week ago. Virginia had more than 4,000 cases, double from the previous week. And the District had about 1,500, more than double from the week before.<\/p>\n<p>The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the area is following a similar trajectory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where are most of the cases occurring in the region?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The large increase in cases is being fueled primarily by the Washington suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland\u2019s recent sharp increase has been felt most heavily in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties. Prince George\u2019s has seen the number of its cases triple as it braces to hit 1,500. Montgomery, on a similar trajectory, just crossed 1,200. The two counties have reported fewer than 70 deaths so far \u2014 35 in Prince George&#8217;s and 29 in Montgomery, as of Thursday \u2014 but those figures are expected to rise.<\/p>\n<p>No county in Virginia has been hit harder than Fairfax, with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/coronavirus\/\">nearly 700 confirmed cases<\/a> reported as of Thursday, triple from the week before. Prince William, Arlington and Loudoun counties are also among the state\u2019s hot spots, though all trail Fairfax with about 300 cases each.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s behind the increase?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The continuing rise in cases seems to reflect both the spread of the disease and increased testing.<\/p>\n<p>Health experts and government officials across the country said for weeks that they lacked enough tests to properly measure, respond to and isolate the coronavirus. Health experts contend there are likely far more cases than have been reported, particularly as jurisdictions limit testing availability to those deemed potential high risk cases and those with a doctor&#8217;s orders.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the number of tests are proliferating, so too are confirmations about the number of cases. Days often go by between when a test is conducted and when the results are known. So the number of confirmed cases are considered a lagging indicator of the virus\u2019 spread.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted that private laboratories in Maryland are aiding the state\u2019s response to COVD-19. He said commercial labs are beginning \u201cto clear their backlog of tests. More than 30% of the new cases reported [Wednesday] are for testing that was completed in March.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the latest estimates for when we might hit the peak?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are so many variables behind estimating the peak that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a forecast with a high level of confidence. Different models and forecasts put states\u2019 peaks at very different times. For instance, the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/covid19.healthdata.org\/united-states-of-america\">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)<\/a> puts the national peak on April 11. Locally, it estimates that D.C.\u2019s peak was on April 9, Maryland will hit its peak on April 17 and Virginia on April 20.<\/p>\n<p>But D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said last week the city was instead relying on Penn Medicine\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/oto.med.upenn.edu\/2020\/03\/31\/covid-19-hospital-impact-model-for-epidemics-chime\/\">COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME)<\/a> model. That one pushes the peak into late June or early July \u2014 and estimates far more possible infections and potential deaths.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser said she thought the University of Washington model was too optimistic because it overestimated how successful social distancing would be in stopping transmission. She would rather prepare for Penn\u2019s worst-case scenario \u2014 especially when it comes to having the right number of hospital beds and ventilators ready.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is hedging his bets. He said earlier this month that he sees the commonwealth\u2019s peak coming in late April or early May. But he also cautioned that people should not read too much into models. \u201cFor now, we are at the beginning of this virus and that is why it\u2019s so important for Virginians to stay at home,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hogan has also advised a cautious approach with the forecasts. \u201cModels are only best estimates and models don&#8217;t necessarily take into account how seriously Maryland has put social distancing measures in place,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Given that this region has so many competing jurisdictions, how are they doing at coordinating their response?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In recent weeks, leaders in D.C., Maryland and Virginia largely have gotten on the same page. They <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/heres-what-maryland-and-virginias-shelter-in-place-orders-mean-for-the-d-c-region\/\">all declared stay-at-home orders on the same day<\/a>, have designated more or less identical <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/27\/what-essential-business-means-in-d-c-maryland-and-virginia\/\">\u201cessential business\u201d<\/a> classifications, have tamped down expectations that schools will reopen for what\u2019s left of the academic year, and have <a href=\"https:\/\/bluevirginia.us\/2020\/03\/76034\">collectively demanded<\/a> that the federal government do more to provide aid and testing for the Washington region, given its critical role as the nation\u2019s capital.<\/p>\n<p>Still, each jurisdiction has announced different dates when their respective stay-at-home orders are expected to lift. Virginia\u2019s order is in effect until June 10, unless Gov. Ralph Northam amends or rescinds the directive. In D.C., the restrictions are in effect until April 24, though that date could change. Maryland, meanwhile, has stated no official end date for its order, which runs until it is terminated by the governor.<\/p>\n<p>The jurisdictions have also drawn dividing lines \u2014 for now, at least \u2014\u00a0when it comes to guidance on masks and face coverings in grocery stores and big box retailers. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an order mandating that stores post signage at their entrances instructing shoppers <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/09\/d-c-grocery-stores-are-now-instructing-shoppers-to-wear-face-masks\/\">to cover their faces with a mask or other covering<\/a> while shopping. But in nearby Montgomery County, <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/06\/coronavirus-latest-week-of-april6\/#mocomasks\">shoppers must wear a mask<\/a> in grocery stores, pharmacies and big box stores.<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning

Cases Surpass 200 For Two-Straight Days, Deaths Rise In Maryland","content":"<p>D.C. reported 201 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the fourth time in less than two weeks that the city has seen its daily case count tip past 200.<\/p>\n<p>On Thanksgiving, the District saw 220 new coronavirus cases, one of the highest daily case counts ever recorded during the pandemic. This came a little over a week after the city reported <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/17\/dc-md-va-covid19-cases-spike-regionally\/\">245 new cases<\/a>, the second-highest total ever recorded in the District.<\/p>\n<p>The consecutive 200-plus daily case counts follow a week of<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/25\/dc-coronavirus-testing-demand-spike-virus-spread-thanksgiving\/\"> increased testing demand<\/a> ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday,<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/23\/dc-covid-restrictions-gyms-restaurants-nonessential-retail-alcohol-sales\/\"> newly announced restrictions on gyms and restaurants from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser<\/a>, and pleas from local officials for residents to reduce travel over the holiday, in hopes of mitigating the effects of what could be the worst to come in the region\u2019s fight against the coronavirus.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday, the seven-day average daily case count per 100,000 residents dipped to 21.52, per data recorded on Nov. 25. The figure hit a fall peak earlier this week at 24.93; the last time it topped 25 cases per 100,000 residents was May 9.<\/p>\n<p>The city\u2019s rate of transmission, a metric that measures the number of infections likely to result from one positive case \u2014 and a significant indicator of a region\u2019s community spread \u2014 also dropped back to a moderate level (1.0), per Friday\u2019s data. This metric hit a troubling peak earlier this month when it reached 1.30 \u2014 a rate not recorded since March.<\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s positivity rate, which measures the number of positive cases out of total tests administered, continues to tick up, despite a surge in testing. On Friday, the city recorded a positivity rate of 5.4%, the highest rate since mid-June. (The World Health Organization recommends a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jhsph.edu\/covid-19\/articles\/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html#:~:text=The%20higher%20the%20percent%20positive,weeks%20before%20governments%20consider%20reopening.\">positivity rate below 5% for reopening measures.<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>D.C.\u2019s acute care hospitalization rate has remained within the moderate range (between 80% and 90% capacity) throughout most of the fall. On Nov. 13, this metric <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/13\/dc-hospitals-covid19-metrics-capacity-region\/\">surpassed the 90% benchmark<\/a> for the first time in the pandemic, but in the days following dipped down between 79% and 86%. Friday\u2019s data reflects an acute bed capacity of 83.5%.<\/p>\n<p>Since the beginning of November, 31 D.C. residents have lost their lives to COVID-19, according to District data. This marks a notable jump from the total deaths recorded in the earlier months of fall and in late summer.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4885963\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1784px;\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4885963 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-27-at-10.59.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1774\" height=\"830\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">D.C.\u2019s daily case rate per 100,000 residents has hit spring-like levels in recent weeks.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Regionally, Maryland has surpassed D.C.\u2019s daily case count per 100,000 residents after staying behind the city for the past several weeks, according to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/local\/dc-maryland-virginia-coronavirus-cases\/\"> Washington Post\u2019s regional coronavirus tracker.\u00a0<\/a>\u00a0The state recorded 2,378 new cases on Friday, the fourth highest daily total ever recorded in the pandemic. On Nov. 19, the state recorded an all-time high of 2,910 new cases.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the state has seen its positivity rate dip down in recent days \u2014 reporting a rate of 6.3% on Friday after hitting a rate above 7% earlier this week. The state had kept that metric below 5% for much of the summer and fall, and even dropped below 3% in parts of September and October.<\/p>\n<p>Hospitalizations have increased at an alarming rate in Maryland, consistently trending upward since the end of October. On Friday, 1,435 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest count since May 18. And daily death counts, which had remained well below 14 throughout most of September and October, have <a href=\"https:\/\/coronavirus.maryland.gov\/\">surpassed 20 in four of the past seven days.<\/a>\u00a0The state reported two deaths on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Cases have spiked notably in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, two of the most populous jurisdictions in the state, and those hardest-hit by the virus over the past eight months. On Friday, Montgomery County recorded a daily case rate per 100,000 residents of 26.66 \u2014 below the state-wide daily rate of 37.21, but still higher than the county\u2019s rate during the spring. The jurisdiction\u2019s positivity rate also remains below the state\u2019s average of 6.3%, at 4.5%. Meanwhile, Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s positivity rate, which has consistently surpassed the state\u2019s rate for a majority of the pandemic, reached 8.33% on Friday \u2014 a number not seen in the county since June. The county\u2019s positive case rate per 100,000 residents also reached 39.5 for the first time during the pandemic on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia, which has consistently maintained lower case counts per 100,000 residents than D.C. and Maryland, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/coronavirus\/key-measures\/\">recorded an all-time-high daily case count<\/a> on Nov. 23, with 3,242 new cases. While the commonwealth reported 1,544 new cases on Friday, the state\u2019s positivity rate continues to remain above 7%.\u00a0Northern Virginia, a hotspot in the state, recorded a seven-day average of 752 daily cases on Friday. The region saw a record-breaking 1,090 new cases on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Like in Maryland, hospitalizations in Virginia have been steadily increasing to spring-like numbers over the past month. On Friday, a total of 1,593 people were reported to be hospitalized with COVID-19 \u2014 the highest total since May 9.<\/p>\n<p>Officials across the region have clamped down on reopening measures in recent weeks as cases continue to climb upward. Earlier this month Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/10\/maryland-larry-hogan-coronavirus-indoor-dining-limits\/\">set new restrictions on restaurants<\/a>, limiting indoor dining capacity from 75% to 50%. He<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/17\/maryland-hogan-covid-phase-three-regulations-restaurants-hospitals-nursing-homes\/\"> later mandated<\/a>\u00a0that restaurants close at 10 p.m., and limited capacity in all retail businesses (including grocery stores) and knocking the cap capacity in religious institutions down to 50% from 75%.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) also announced <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/13\/virginia-issues-new-coronavirus-restrictions-as-cases-spike\/\">announced a slew of new COVID-19 restrictions<\/a>: limiting public and private gatherings, both indoors or outdoors, from 250 to 25 people, prohibiting alcohol sales past 10 p.m., and expanding the mask mandate to include children over the age of five. And most recently, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/23\/dc-covid-restrictions-gyms-restaurants-nonessential-retail-alcohol-sales\/\">announced \u201cadjustments\u201d<\/a> to the city\u2019s Phase Two reopening measures, limiting indoor gatherings from 50 to 10 people, suspending indoor workout classes, and stopping alcohol sales at restaurants at 10 p.m., among other restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, epidemiologists and public health experts have warned that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/11\/11\/us-prepares-for-worst-four-months-of-the-pandemic-as-it-stares-down-the-darkest-days-yet.html\">worst could be yet to come<\/a> for the country\u2019s fight against the virus. Regional leaders, meanwhile, are preparing for a dark winter. In D.C., officials <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/18\/d-c-expanding-coronavirus-testing-hours-and-sites-new-restrictions-coming-soon\/\">expanded testing site hours<\/a> and added a new, semi-heated location. In Maryland, the health department activated its <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/11\/10\/maryland-larry-hogan-coronavirus-indoor-dining-limits\/\">hospital surge capacity plan<\/a>, and Northam announced plans for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/blog\/2020\/11\/13\/governor-northam-announces-new-statewide-measures-to-contain-covid-19\/\">more robust and centralized

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017. Bao Li\u2019s grandparents, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, lived at the National Zoo for 23 years before being returned to China last year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"resg-s1-1309\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\">\n<div class=\"imagewrap has-source-dimensions\" data-crop-type=\"\">\n<figure style=\"width: 700px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"img\" src=\"https:\/\/npr.brightspotcdn.com\/dims3\/default\/strip\/false\/crop\/5187x3890+589+0\/resize\/700\/quality\/85\/format\/jpeg\/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Fb4%2F2005646341d5ab2313bae6a2817f%2Fgettyimages-1697326608.jpg\" alt=\"Male giant panda Xiao Qi Ji walks around his enclosure at the Smithsonian National Zoo on Sept. 23, 2023 in Washington, D.C., as visitors watch.\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" data-template=\"https:\/\/npr.brightspotcdn.com\/dims3\/default\/strip\/false\/crop\/5187x3890+589+0\/resize\/{width}\/quality\/{quality}\/format\/{format}\/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Fb4%2F2005646341d5ab2313bae6a2817f%2Fgettyimages-1697326608.jpg\" data-format=\"jpeg\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Male giant panda Xiao Qi Ji walks around his enclosure at the Smithsonian National Zoo on Sept. 23, 2023 in Washington, D.C.<\/span> <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3 class=\"edTag\">\u201cWe need that panda!\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>Mariel Lally, one of the zoo\u2019s panda keepers, traveled with the bears in the FedEx cargo plane last year on their flight back to China. While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop.

All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote. If re-elected I look forward to discussing the results of our initial study on the impacts of the new policies with the community.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

Please answer the following briefly:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes, I wrote and led the effort to continue and fund the current pilot program through the end of FY25 until we can consider a more permanent or expanded program in FY26. The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We made a significant investment in both the operating and capital budgets for ACPS in the FY25 budget allocating over $8 million in new revenue to ACPS out of $11.75 million in new revenue. In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program? <\/strong>Yes. In Alexandria and nationally, this program (called ARISE) has been proven to benefit families and foster economic growth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding. We need to leverage the unique opportunities available to AHRA and our industrial development authority because we cannot keep waiting for Richmond to fund these needed projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I believe Zoning for Housing was a step in the right direction but much more must be done. Nothing in Z4H ensures that developers build the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d workforce housing or affordable housing. It\u2019s imperative that members of Council use their votes on each and every project to ensure that each project benefits Alexandria and meets the needs of our community members.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Providing a quality education for every student must be a priority, as is retaining quality educators. When I look at the City budget, I am constantly reminded the local government is responsible for three major areas: public safety, infrastructure and education. We must do these things well because no other level of government can address them or provide the needed investments. Our schools must be fully funded.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#McPike\"><\/a>Kirk McPike<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049097\" style=\"width: 840px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049097\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Kirk-McPike-Headshot-400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Kirk McPike.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Kirk McPike campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Kirk McPike is a current member of the City Council.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid.
