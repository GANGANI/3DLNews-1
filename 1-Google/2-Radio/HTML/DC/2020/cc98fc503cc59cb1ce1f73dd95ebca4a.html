Jenene Miller was just a one-month old baby. Breyanna Collier was still three decades from being born.<\/p>\n<p>They were among the multi-generational crowd on the National Mall on a hot summer\u2019s day, energized by the movement and deeply dismayed by the historic parallels that remain more than a half century later.<\/p>\n<p>The National Action Network began planning the march in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing in June, which sparked uprisings around the country. The new March on Washington was scheduled for 57 years to the day that Martin Luther King Jr. made his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.<\/p>\n<p>Flemming\u2019s family of seven couldn\u2019t afford the trip to the original event. This time he was able to come with his wife, daughter, and granddaughter.<\/p>\n<p>The 71-year-old has told them stories of what it was like to grow up as a black man in a largely segregated Chicago. Flemming recalls being chased away from a hamburger and hotdog stand in a white part of town, as people threw bottles and bricks at him and his friends in 1966.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTell you the truth, I never thought I would see this day where black, white, across the board Americans come together for a cause that\u2019s righteous \u2014 and that\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cTo not just care about the population, but one population within the people that\u2019s been treated unfairly for a very, very long time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller drove 10 hours with her husband and waited on line for an hour and a half to enter the Mall grounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here from Atlanta, home of John Lewis. We went to Selma for his farewell when he came across the Peace Bridge for the last time and we wanted to be here for this,\u201d Miller said, her voice slightly muffled by a black mask with white lettering that read \u201cVOTE\u201d and a face shield that declared \u201cGOOD TROUBLE.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want the virus, but we have to be here for the cause. It\u2019s worth it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She was an infant during the first march, and reflects on how much remains the same.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere I am 57 years later and it doesn\u2019t seem like much changed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m here, as an adult, for this march, for my children and my grandchildren.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Collier attended a protest in June back home in Charleston, South Carolina. The 25-year-old joined an activist book club, which spurred her to become a poll worker and to reflect more deeply on both her own experiences and the country\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think for a minute people felt like we were living in a post-racialized society, but it has not gone away,\u201d she said, as she headed for the Mall early this morning. \u201cWhen you\u2019re learning, you do the history, you understand we\u2019re not that far. We haven\u2019t come that far. We\u2019ve made headway, but there\u2019s still a lot more work to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-11-of-15-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Protesters gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. <span class=\"credits\">Dee Dwyer \/ WAMU\/DCist<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dee-Dwyer_March-on-Washington2-8-of-15-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Masked protesters stand in front of the Lincoln Memorial as the Rev.

As Trump spoke on Thursday night, he\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/live\/2020\/08\/27\/us\/rnc-convention-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made little mention<\/a>\u00a0of the national grief following recent police killings of Black Americans.<\/p>\n<p>But on Friday, before a crowd that was largely made up of Black and Brown attendees, speakers invoked the names of those killed by police, often growing overcome by emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Kentucky Rep. Charles Booker spoke about Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBreonna, I\u2019m representing you right now,\u201d Booker told the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Families of people killed by police frequently paused during their respective remarks, overcome with emotion. The crowd filled the silences with cries of \u201cSay his name \u2026 George Floyd,\u201d and \u201cSay her name \u2026 Breonna Taylor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so overwhelmed right now, with everybody here right now,\u201d said Philonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd. \u201cI wish George were here to see this right now. That\u2019s who I\u2019m marching for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Martin Luther King III introduced his 12-year-old daughter Yolanda Renee King, who spoke to her generation from the same monument where her grandfather Martin Luther King Jr. spoke 57 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGreat challenges produce great leaders. We have mastered the selfie and Tik Tok, now we must master ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cLess than a year before he was assassinated, my grandfather predicted this very moment. He said we were moving into a new phase of the struggle. The first phase was the civil rights. And the new phase is genuine equality. \u2026 We are going to be the generation that ends systemic racism once and for all, now and forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After telling the crowd that he was a \u201cproud dad,\u201d Martin Luther King III noted that the March on Washington is also assembled on the day that 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi in 1955.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c65 years later, we still struggle for justice,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Rev. Al Sharpton, head of NAN, called for political change, advocating for two pieces of legislation:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/7120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act<\/a>, a sweeping federal police reform bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020, a reinstatement of the Voting Rights Act.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDemonstration without legislation will not lead to change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out here and stand in this heat because we didn\u2019t have anything to do. If we will stand in the heat, we will stand in the polls all day long.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He also made mention of the pandemic looming over the event.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe keep telling y\u2019all to spread out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came to show with our bodies that enough is enough.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Organizers tried to take precautions: Participants entered through designated entrances, where officials took their temperatures and were arranged into grids for social distancing.<\/p>\n<p>The vast majority of attendees wore masks throughout the event. Some speakers even wore masks at the podium, though it muffled their voices. But plans to have the crowd practice social distancing quickly went by the wayside on the podium and in the throngs who lined the Reflecting Pool.<\/p>\n<p>Sharpton closed his speech by asking participants to sign up at the NAN\u2019s website to be poll workers during the November election. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have foot soldiers to protect the vote,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<div class='gallery wamu-slideshow'><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_08-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Kaitlin Bryant, left, Miss Black Alabama International Ambassador 2020, and Yhana Johnson, Miss Black Tennessee International Ambassador 2020, at the March on Washington.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_07-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Aisha Boykin from Columbus, Ohio, at the March on Washington.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-3000x2000.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_06-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">Ricardo The Patriot from Polk City, Fla. \"Black people have been here since before the United States was a country, people forget that.\"<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><div><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-3000x1481.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-300x148.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-1024x506.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-1500x741.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-900x444.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-600x296.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200828_March_On_Washington_01a-1600x790.jpg 1600w\" \/><figcaption class=\"slideshow-caption\">From left, sisters Xji-Anne Hudson, Tsa-Qhura Hudson and Jasmine Rivera of Albany, NY, at the March.<span class=\"credits\">Tyrone Turner \/ WAMU<\/span><\/figcaption><\/div><\/div>\n<p>For many, the wait to get past the temperature checks was just the last step of a long trip.<\/p>\n<p>Yazmyne Franklin, a newly-minted history teacher, came from Louisville, Ken., to join her ancestors in protesting for racial justice.<\/p>\n<p>She said when she heard about the march, she immediately thought, \u201cI have to do it.

Area Reopen \u2014 And What Will That Look Like?","content":"<p>The calendar&#8217;s turned to May and most of us have been sheltering-at-home for more than a month now. Seemingly all of the Washington region is rising up as one to ask \u2014 when can we get out?<\/p>\n<p>Soon, seems to be the answer, though everything won&#8217;t re-open at once. Not even close. And what does re-open will probably do so with precautions and social distancing.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where things stand.<\/p>\n<h4>Just how much longer are we going to be in a virtual lockdown?<\/h4>\n<p>No one can reliably give you a good answer quite yet, and that&#8217;s largely because confirmed cases continue to grow in the Washington region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sadly our numbers are still on the rise,&#8221; Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said during a Wednesday appearance on &#8220;The Daily Show.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We caution against people saying we&#8217;re starting to see a reduction in numbers, because we&#8217;re not ready to make that definitive statement,&#8221; LaQuandra Nesbitt, D.C. Department of Health director, said the same day. On May 1, D.C. saw it&#8217;s biggest single-day increase in confirmed cases: 335.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, any moves to reopen the local economy and start lifting restrictions will be based on how many new cases D.C., Maryland and Virginia are logging.\u00a0That&#8217;s a key factor in determining when the virtual lockdown can be comfortably eased \u2014 14-straight days of decreasing confirmed cases.<\/p>\n<p>Local officials are creating a process for a phased re-opening, but it may be a while. This week, D.C. officials did offer a <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/30\/reopening-d-c-may-not-happen-until-summer-city-officials-warn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">range of possibilities for a possible opening<\/a>. On the earliest end, they said, we could be looking at late May or early June, but the more pessimistic scenario could put any reopening into late June or early July.<\/p>\n<h4>Are these stay-at-home orders actually working?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes. At least according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the nation\u2019s most prominent expert on the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My message to my fellow Washingtonians is we&#8217;re doing a really good job of preventing this from exploding by doing the mitigation of physical separation,&#8221; Fauci told the the Washington Nationals&#8217; Ryan Zimmerman <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/04\/29\/anthony-fauci-talks-to-ryan-zimmerman-about-bowser-baseball-and-brad-pitts-brooklyn-accent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this week<\/a>. &#8220;We need to keep it up a bit longer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser echoed that point. &#8220;We have far fewer cases of COVID-19 than what initial projections predicted what we might have going into May. It&#8217;s not an exaggeration to say that staying home has indeed saved lives,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<h4>Who decides when to lift the stay-at-home orders?<\/h4>\n<p>President Trump initially declared himself the decider-in-chief. He&#8217;s since backed off that expansive view of his own power. The decision is ultimately being left to governors and mayors, at least in the Washington region. And they, in turn, are consulting with local and national health experts.<\/p>\n<p>But others may influence the outcome, too. For instance, while gun ranges in Virginia generally remain closed under the state&#8217;s stay-at-home order, a circuit court judge this week ordered that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/04\/28\/politics\/virginia-gun-range-coronavirus\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of them could reopen<\/a> as long as it followed social distancing guidelines. But another Virginia judge <a href=\"https:\/\/dcist.com\/story\/20\/04\/27\/coronavirus-latest-dc-maryland-virginia-week-of-april-27\/#gymsuit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruled against two state senators<\/a> who sued on behalf of Gold&#8217;s Gym franchises, seeking to allow them to reopen.<\/p>\n<p>And in Maryland, some Republican delegates have been pressing Hogan \u2014 himself a Republican \u2014 to loosen restrictions on certain activities, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fox5dc.com\/news\/some-boaters-and-businesses-hoping-maryland-governor-will-lift-recreational-boating-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">like boating<\/a>. Rep. Andy Harris, the state&#8217;s sole Republican in Congress, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marylandmatters.org\/2020\/04\/29\/in-rebuke-of-hogan-rep-harris-to-visit-firms-ready-to-open\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visited businesses on the Eastern Shore<\/a> he said were ready to open again.<\/p>\n<p>But the most that will do is put pressure on Hogan; any decision to lift the stay-at-home order will ultimately come from him, unless a court steps in to say otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>In D.C., lawmakers continue to stand behind Bowser, who will make the final call on when to start lifting restrictions. But there is always the Trump card: the president could well order federal workers back to their offices, and local officials would be limited in what they could do to stop that.<\/p>\n<h4>What will local leaders base their decisions on?<\/h4>\n<p>Bowser, Hogan and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam say they&#8217;ll rely mainly on health considerations and strict metrics when deciding when and how to reopen their respective economies.<\/p>\n<p>The three elected leaders are largely following White House guidelines that call for a 14-day decline in confirmed cases of the coronavirus, improved testing and contact tracing capabilities, enough hospital beds to handle expected cases, and enough personal protective equipment to cover expected demand.<\/p>\n<p>Hogan&#8217;s &#8220;Roadmap to Recovery&#8221; \u2014 which you can read <a href=\"https:\/\/governor.maryland.gov\/recovery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a> \u2014 lays out the metrics clearly.<\/p>\n<h4>Is pretty much everything going to open at once?<\/h4>\n<p>No, not by a long shot. And all three elected leaders have used pretty much the same analogy to explain what reopening will \u2014 and will not \u2014 look like.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We cannot and will not lift restrictions the way you turn on a light switch,&#8221; Northam said this week. &#8220;Don&#8217;t anticipate a light switch going on and everything going back to normal,&#8221; Bowser offered. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to flip a light switch,&#8221; Hogan said in mid-April.<\/p>\n<p>Still, local elected officials do seem to be making a concerted effort to coordinate their responses. That&#8217;s largely minimized the risk so far of having patchwork orders imposed on the Washington region.<\/p>\n<p>Restrictions will ease gradually, with some businesses and possibly schools allowed to reopen \u2014 but with social distancing guidelines left in place. That means limits on the number of people in a closed space and requirements that they keep a six-foot distance from one another. Any gathering with big crowds \u2014 a sporting event or concert \u2014 is at best many months away, if not longer.<\/p>\n<h4>What sort of places are likely to be open first?<\/h4>\n<p>Northam permitted elective surgeries and dental procedures <a href=\"https:\/\/wtop.com\/coronavirus\/2020\/04\/virginia-gov-northam-elective-surgeries-dental-procedures-can-resume-soon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this week<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Expect hair stylists and barber shops to be among the first wave or reopenings, too, albeit with social distancing requirements in place. Hogan has allowed them to reopen in Maryland, though only for essential personnel at the outset. Expect that to be expanded to the general public once restrictions start being lifted.<\/p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve heard we might need to do some social distancing even when businesses and restaurants reopen. How would that work?<\/h4>\n<p>It might require some forms of crowd control in retail shops. Expect limits on the number of customers at any one time and orders that you keep your distance from one another. But when it comes to bars, restaurants, clubs and even schools \u2014 places that naturally handle crowds \u2014 you can expect more dramatic changes.<\/p>\n<p>In restaurants, tables may have to be spaced further apart. And don&#8217;t expect to be able to mosey up to the bar for a drink at your favorite watering hole. If you want a sense of the what the restaurant of the near-future could look like, just read <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/barredindc\/status\/1255952518917558274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what Georgetown&#8217;s Filomena is planning<\/a>. Of course, while reopening might sound like a savior for bars and restaurants, many owners have already said that operating at half-capacity won&#8217;t be sustainable in the long-term.<\/p>\n<p>As for schools, there&#8217;s talk of everything from sending kids in on alternating days to requiring that class sizes shrink significantly. Again, those decisions could dramatically change the nature of education, which some schools and students would be better equipped to handle than others.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/05\/01\/how-does-transportation-and-commuting-change-in-a-post-coronavirus-world-we-asked-experts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the future of public transit after coronavirus<\/a>, face coverings will likely remain the norm for a while, and rows of seats on buses and trains could be cordoned off to make sure people keep their distance from each other.<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning reporting

Region To Flattening \u2018The Curve\u2019 Of The Coronavirus?","content":"<p>The coronavirus pandemic has not yet hit the Washington region with the same force in which it\u2019s hit other metro areas. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1-dOqXayX9wAQt5XOFyQX8__2VzEVGCy5bGCEmIQuKqI\/edit#gid=1913078281\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth in confirmed cases<\/a> is showing an ominous upturn that some other cities have already experienced. Here\u2019s a quick look at where things stand here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We\u2019ve heard so much about \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of confirmed cases and deaths. Where are we on the curve now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Still very much on the upswing. The number of confirmed cases are up sharply this week in Maryland and D.C., and rising only a little more slowly in Virginia. Confirmed cases across the three jurisdictions crossed the <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/06\/coronavirus-latest-week-of-april6\/#covidcases\">10,000 threshold, according to figures reported Wednesday.<\/a><\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h5>Tracking Coronavirus<\/h5>\n<p>Read WAMU&#8217;s ongoing coverage of coronavirus and <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/26\/guide_to_coronavirus_dc_maryland_virginia_testing_cases_schools_transit_resources_help_closures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what you need to know about it<\/a> in the D.C. region.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn-generic\" href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/series\/coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read More<\/a><br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>Maryland alone accounted for more than 6,000 in cases reported for Wednesday, about triple the cases from one week ago. Virginia had more than 4,000 cases, double from the previous week. And the District had about 1,500, more than double from the week before.<\/p>\n<p>The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the area is following a similar trajectory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where are most of the cases occurring in the region?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The large increase in cases is being fueled primarily by the Washington suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland\u2019s recent sharp increase has been felt most heavily in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties. Prince George\u2019s has seen the number of its cases triple as it braces to hit 1,500. Montgomery, on a similar trajectory, just crossed 1,200. The two counties have reported fewer than 70 deaths so far \u2014 35 in Prince George&#8217;s and 29 in Montgomery, as of Thursday \u2014 but those figures are expected to rise.<\/p>\n<p>No county in Virginia has been hit harder than Fairfax, with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/coronavirus\/\">nearly 700 confirmed cases<\/a> reported as of Thursday, triple from the week before. Prince William, Arlington and Loudoun counties are also among the state\u2019s hot spots, though all trail Fairfax with about 300 cases each.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s behind the increase?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The continuing rise in cases seems to reflect both the spread of the disease and increased testing.<\/p>\n<p>Health experts and government officials across the country said for weeks that they lacked enough tests to properly measure, respond to and isolate the coronavirus. Health experts contend there are likely far more cases than have been reported, particularly as jurisdictions limit testing availability to those deemed potential high risk cases and those with a doctor&#8217;s orders.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the number of tests are proliferating, so too are confirmations about the number of cases. Days often go by between when a test is conducted and when the results are known. So the number of confirmed cases are considered a lagging indicator of the virus\u2019 spread.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted that private laboratories in Maryland are aiding the state\u2019s response to COVD-19. He said commercial labs are beginning \u201cto clear their backlog of tests. More than 30% of the new cases reported [Wednesday] are for testing that was completed in March.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the latest estimates for when we might hit the peak?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are so many variables behind estimating the peak that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a forecast with a high level of confidence. Different models and forecasts put states\u2019 peaks at very different times. For instance, the University of Washington\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/covid19.healthdata.org\/united-states-of-america\">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)<\/a> puts the national peak on April 11. Locally, it estimates that D.C.\u2019s peak was on April 9, Maryland will hit its peak on April 17 and Virginia on April 20.<\/p>\n<p>But D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said last week the city was instead relying on Penn Medicine\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/oto.med.upenn.edu\/2020\/03\/31\/covid-19-hospital-impact-model-for-epidemics-chime\/\">COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME)<\/a> model. That one pushes the peak into late June or early July \u2014 and estimates far more possible infections and potential deaths.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser said she thought the University of Washington model was too optimistic because it overestimated how successful social distancing would be in stopping transmission. She would rather prepare for Penn\u2019s worst-case scenario \u2014 especially when it comes to having the right number of hospital beds and ventilators ready.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is hedging his bets. He said earlier this month that he sees the commonwealth\u2019s peak coming in late April or early May. But he also cautioned that people should not read too much into models. \u201cFor now, we are at the beginning of this virus and that is why it\u2019s so important for Virginians to stay at home,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Hogan has also advised a cautious approach with the forecasts. \u201cModels are only best estimates and models don&#8217;t necessarily take into account how seriously Maryland has put social distancing measures in place,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Given that this region has so many competing jurisdictions, how are they doing at coordinating their response?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In recent weeks, leaders in D.C., Maryland and Virginia largely have gotten on the same page. They <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/heres-what-maryland-and-virginias-shelter-in-place-orders-mean-for-the-d-c-region\/\">all declared stay-at-home orders on the same day<\/a>, have designated more or less identical <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/27\/what-essential-business-means-in-d-c-maryland-and-virginia\/\">\u201cessential business\u201d<\/a> classifications, have tamped down expectations that schools will reopen for what\u2019s left of the academic year, and have <a href=\"https:\/\/bluevirginia.us\/2020\/03\/76034\">collectively demanded<\/a> that the federal government do more to provide aid and testing for the Washington region, given its critical role as the nation\u2019s capital.<\/p>\n<p>Still, each jurisdiction has announced different dates when their respective stay-at-home orders are expected to lift. Virginia\u2019s order is in effect until June 10, unless Gov. Ralph Northam amends or rescinds the directive. In D.C., the restrictions are in effect until April 24, though that date could change. Maryland, meanwhile, has stated no official end date for its order, which runs until it is terminated by the governor.<\/p>\n<p>The jurisdictions have also drawn dividing lines \u2014 for now, at least \u2014\u00a0when it comes to guidance on masks and face coverings in grocery stores and big box retailers. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an order mandating that stores post signage at their entrances instructing shoppers <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/09\/d-c-grocery-stores-are-now-instructing-shoppers-to-wear-face-masks\/\">to cover their faces with a mask or other covering<\/a> while shopping. But in nearby Montgomery County, <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/04\/06\/coronavirus-latest-week-of-april6\/#mocomasks\">shoppers must wear a mask<\/a> in grocery stores, pharmacies and big box stores.<\/p>\n\t<div class=\"story-appeal\">\n\t\t\t<h3>Your Support Makes It All Possible<\/h3>\n\t\t<p>When you give to WAMU, your tax-deductible gift helps make possible the award-winning

Doctor Feeling Like \u2018An Intern All Over Again\u2019","content":"<p>The coronavirus carries special risks for the elderly, but it hasn\u2019t spared young people. Children\u2019s National Hospital has taken a number of actions to respond to the disease, including restricting the number of visitors and offering a drive-up testing site.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Rahul Shah, an Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon there, has been practicing medicine for two decades. But when it comes to combating this virus, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s like being an intern all over again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Shah is also the hospital\u2019s Chief Quality and Safety Officer. He told WAMU\u2019s Jonathan Wilson that as a surgical intern, \u201cYou have life and death in front of you. You&#8217;re constantly adapting, learning new information, [being] put in challenging situations. And I think that&#8217;s what the COVID crisis is all about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said the hospital began preparing for the coronavirus in January, trying to shore up its supply chain and obtaining more personal protective equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Now, he says, if you walk into the hospital, \u201cyou&#8217;d see a different scene\u201d than the one that existed before the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter. There aren\u2019t as many visitors. The seating for the cafeteria has probably been cut into a quarter, if not a fifth. We\u2019re really practicing social distancing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The restrictions on visitors can be especially difficult for young patients.<\/p>\n<p>Large, extended families are no longer welcome to help cheer patients up during visitor hours. Dr. Shah says he\u2019s concerned about the long-term mental health of social distancing, \u201cnot only of our patients, but of all the kids out in the community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He said the days have been particularly draining. \u201cI\u2019ve never worked harder \u2014 not in terms of hours or work ethic \u2014 just cognitively, than I have since I was an intern.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet Dr. Shah says he\u2019s grateful for the appreciation that the hospital and wider community is expressing for health care providers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always optimistic that if we do the right thing, we will succeed.\u201d<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Dr. Rahul Shah, Chief Quality and Safety Officer at Children\u2019s National Hospital, says recent days have been particularly draining.

Larry Hogan <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/hogan-issues-stay-at-home-orders-for-maryland\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spoke more forcefully<\/a> about the situation Monday morning than he had just last week. \u201cWe are no longer asking or suggesting Marylanders to stay at home,&#8221; he said, pausing briefly for emphasis. &#8220;We are directing them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/northam-to-order-virginia-residents-to-stay-at-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">followed a few hours later<\/a>, similarly ordering residents of the commonwealth to stay put.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h5>Where You Can And Can&#8217;t Go<\/h5>\n<p>D.C., Virginia and Maryland have all issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders for everything except essential work and errands.<\/p>\n<p>In all three jurisdictions, <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/27\/what-essential-business-means-in-d-c-maryland-and-virginia\/\">\u201cessential\u201d businesses<\/a> remain open. This generally includes grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, hardware stores, laundromats and dry cleaners, pet shops and animal services, medical facilities (including cannabis dispensaries in D.C. and Maryland), banks and other financial service providers, gas stations, auto repair shops, bike shops, wireless stores, and yes, liquor stores.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure whether a business or service falls under \u201cessential,\u201d check this list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">critical infrastructure sectors<\/a> as identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. If it seems essential, it probably is.<\/p>\n<p>Bars and restaurants (except those offering delivery or carry-out), movie theaters, salons and barber shops, tattoo shops, gyms, spas, recreation centers, amusement parks, golf courses and campgrounds fall under \u201cnonessential,\u201d so they\u2019re supposed to be closed.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of location, gatherings of 10 or more people are banned. (This doesn\u2019t apply to large families in a single household or essential businesses that need 10 or more people to operate.) Residents are still <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/31\/heres-what-you-can-still-do-outside-under-local-stay-at-home-orders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allowed to take strolls and exercise outdoors<\/a>, but they must maintain social distancing while doing so. Virginia specifically closed public beaches, except for fishing and exercising, and social distancing requirements remain in effect.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who knowingly violates these stay-at-home orders could be guilty of a misdemeanor.<\/p>\n<p><\/aside>\n<p>But what exactly are the effects of <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/d-c-mayor-issues-stay-at-home-order-following-maryland-virginia\/\">D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser&#8217;s<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/governor.maryland.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Gatherings-FOURTH-AMENDED-3.30.20.pdf\">Hogan\u2019s<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.governor.virginia.gov\/media\/governorvirginiagov\/executive-actions\/EO-55-Temporary-Stay-at-Home-Order-Due-to-Novel-Coronavirus-(COVID-19).pdf\">Northam\u2019s<\/a> respective stay-at-home orders, and how do D.C., Maryland and Virginia\u2019s responses relate to other local jurisdictions?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some practical questions and the answers, as we understand them now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What exactly did Bowser, Hogan and Northam prohibit?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The orders are essentially a reminder of a message that has been repeated many times in recent weeks: stay home as much as possible. Exceptions are noted for essential activities like grocery shopping, medical appointments or outdoor exercise (while maintaining good distance between yourself and others, of course). And if you want to know what you can still do outside, <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/31\/heres-what-you-can-still-do-outside-under-local-stay-at-home-orders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here&#8217;s a quick guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>They also stress that any gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited. Only <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/27\/what-essential-business-means-in-d-c-maryland-and-virginia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">essential businesses<\/a> are allowed to remain open. And those that are essential must scale back their operations, limit staff and institute telework as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How will this be enforced?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Maryland, the new restrictions go into effect at 8 p.m. Monday; Hogan has not yet stated when the order will be lifted. In Virginia, it\u2019s pretty much the same; the commonwealth&#8217;s order is in effect until June 10, unless Northam amends or rescinds the directive. In D.C., however, the restrictions go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 1 and will last until April 24.<\/p>\n<p>Hogan said violators would be charged with a misdemeanor and subject to a penalty that could include imprisonment of up to one year and fine of up to $5,000 \u2014 or both.<\/p>\n<p>In Virginia, violations can be met with up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. In D.C., violators could be charged with a misdemeanor, and they could face a fine of up to $5,000, jail time of less than 90 days or both.\u00a0In guidance issued April 1, D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told officers only to make arrests as a last resort. Newsham&#8217;s guidance says that when officers see potential violations, they should \u201cprovide a warning while maintaining a safe distance.\u201d Officers have already been given scripts to read out of the loudspeakers of their patrol cars,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/03\/30\/coronavirus_latest_dc_maryland_virginia_week_of_april_1\/#mpdloudspeaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which they started using at the end of March<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But how likely is it that police will patrol the entirety of the region starting Monday?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t expect to be stopped as you drive to the grocery store or be asked to show any sort of permission slip or proof. Nor will police officers jump from their cruisers with measuring tape to ensure that you\u2019re staying at least six feet away from others when you go for a walk around the block.<\/p>\n<p>But some more enforcement is likely. Hogan\u2019s chief legal counsel suggests that essential businesses that remain open provide employees with a letter saying as much, \u201cin case the employees are stopped by law enforcement.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LETTERS\/PERMISSION SLIPS.

Maryland officials wanted you to stay home before and they want you to know now that they mean it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will D.C., Maryland and Virginia residents be able to cross state lines?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Hogan did say he is <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GovLarryHogan\/status\/1244662939581202432\">urging Marylanders not to cross state lines<\/a> \u2014 and self-quarantine for 14 days if they do \u2014\u00a0neither Hogan nor Northam\u2019s orders are a travel ban.<\/p>\n<p>D.C. residents can still go food shopping in Maryland, Maryland residents can come into D.C. to buy gas and Virginia workers who have to move across the region as part of their jobs will still be able to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does the D.C. area get any special attention being the nation\u2019s capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hogan, Northam and D.C.

But none have gone as far as leaders in states like California and New York, where full-fledged shelter-in-place orders were announced in recent days.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what we know about these local restrictions.<\/p>\n<h4>What exactly is Maryland saying?<\/h4>\n<p>Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses to close by 5 p.m. But he did not issue more restrictive shelter-in-place orders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet me be clear: We are not issuing or ordering a shelter-in-place directive or forcing people to stay home,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cHowever we are telling all Marylanders to follow all of the directives we\u2019ve already issued and to follow state law against crowds of more than 10 people and we are telling you unless you have an essential reason to leave your house, then you should stay in your homes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[<a href=\"\/story\/20\/03\/23\/coronavirus_latest_dc_maryland_virginia_week_of_march_23\/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=spring\"><em>Read the latest updates about coronavirus in our region here<\/em><\/a>]<\/p>\n<h4>What\u2019s considered an essential business in Maryland?<\/h4>\n<p>The state-issued guidance to try to clarify different kinds of businesses that are considered \u201ccritical\u201d under federal guidelines. That includes pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers, lodging, janitorial services, hospitals, banks, etc. It\u2019s a fairly long list and you can find it all here.<br \/>\nHow about grocery stores?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, they\u2019re included, as are drug stores and convenience stores \u2014 even medical marijuana dispensaries and pet stores.<\/p>\n<h4>What\u2019s the latest from the District?<\/h4>\n<p>Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday again urged people to remain home as much as possible. \u201cWhat we know is that we have basically closed down the District, so the gathering places have been shut down,\u201d said Bowser.<\/p>\n<h4>So is the District considering that a lockdown of sorts?<\/h4>\n<p>No. Bowser was also clear about that. \u201cWhat a shelter-in-place says is you can never leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are telling people is to only leave your house for essential activities.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Did Bowser provide any additional information about what\u2019s an essential activity?<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s no strict definition, but it&#8217;s broadly considered to include basic activities such as grocery shopping, heading to the doctor or drug store, going to the bank or taking a walk in your neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>But even while conducting those activities, D.C. officials are urging people to keep their distance from one other, and not linger for too long.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h5>Tracking Coronavirus<\/h5>\n<p>Read WAMU&#8217;s ongoing coverage of coronavirus and <a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/20\/02\/28\/your-questions-about-coronavirus-in-the-washington-region-answered\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what you need to know about it<\/a> in the D.C. region.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"btn-generic\" href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/series\/coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read More<\/a><br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<h4>What additional measures did Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announce today?<\/h4>\n<p>He ordered schools closed through the end of the academic year and said restaurants would need to close their dining rooms. Recreational businesses were also ordered to shut.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurants will be permitted to serve carryout, curbside and delivery only. Personal care services like barbershops, spas and massage parlors will need to close. Nonessential retail businesses can remain open, Northam said, provided they restrict entry to 10 people or fewer.<\/p>\n<h4>Are the local officials practicing what they preach?<\/h4>\n<p>Hogan certainly said as much Monday. &#8220;I&#8217;m following the same advice I&#8217;m giving everyone else,\u201d he said, adding that he was practicing social distancing, frequently washing his hands and minimizing travel. What was undeniable was that throughout both Bowser\u2019s and Hogan\u2019s news conferences, speakers kept their distance from one another. And in both cases, everyone but the person doing sign language largely kept their hands clasped, either at their front or at their back.<\/p>\n<h4>Can restaurants still provide take-out meals?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes. In fact, Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz urged restaurants to continue offering carryout services. The same applies to D.C. and Virginia, too.<\/p>\n<p>How do the jurisdictions plan to enforce the local restrictions on non-essential travel?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s yet to be seen. But Bowser specified that police would be empowered to disperse any large groups of people \u2014 including those playing pickup basketball or soccer games.<\/p>\n<p>Concerned that people were still flocking to the Tidal Basin to see the cherry blossoms despite requests not to, D.C. extended road closures on Sunday to further restrict access to the area. She asked the police department to work with the D.C. National Guard to enforce it.<\/p>\n<h4>Are local actions consistent with what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the country?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, broadly speaking. The number of states and local jurisdictions issuing restrictions is growing. New York, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Nevada and New Jersey were among the first and were soon followed by Delaware, Ohio and Louisiana. Some of them specifically issued stay-at-home orders.<\/p>\n<h4>What do these orders have in common?<\/h4>\n<p>In most places, businesses deemed non-essential have been ordered to close all physical locations. The federal government gives states broad authority when it comes to designating what\u2019s essential or not, but places like restaurants, bars, nightclubs, hair salons and retail shops have generally been categorized as non-essential.<\/p>\n<h4>Do you have more information about the government\u2019s ability to enforce these orders?<\/h4>\n<p>It isn\u2019t entirely clear what powers the government has to enforce shelter-in-place orders. Most states have made violating the orders a misdemeanor, often punishable by a fine.<\/p>\n<p>The first test of emergency powers has been closing non-essential businesses. Businesses in D.C. that don\u2019t comply with Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s executive order can face criminal and civil penalties, including up to a $1,000 fine, or lose their license.<\/p>\n<p>Maryland state and local police say they would arrest those who flouted the rules on gym, movie theater and eat-in bar and restaurant closures. Maryland State Police officials said they would first try to educate business owners, and if they didn\u2019t comply, they\u2019d work with local state\u2019s attorneys to issue a criminal summons. Violation of a governor\u2019s executive order is punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 or one year in jail, or both.<\/p>\n<p>Virginia business operators violating an executive order could face a number of punishments.<\/p>\n<h4>What exactly is the National Guard\u2019s role?<\/h4>\n<p>All three local jurisdictions have activated the National Guard as part of states of emergency, but what role they might have in terms of forcing people to remain at home has not been specified. Officials from the Maryland National Guard say they will support police if requested.<\/p>\n<p><em>This story was updated with additional information about new local

White House. He Provided A Hug","content":"<p><strong>This story was updated at 5:14 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>President Trump was booed by Washington Nationals fans during the World Series, but warmly embraced by several of the players during an appearance at the White House earlier today. Trump returned the favor \u2013 literally.<\/p>\n<p>Most team members who spoke during Monday\u2019s event didn\u2019t address Trump directly. But a couple of them did. Catcher Kurt Suzuki, the first to speak, donned a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. Trump seemed elated at the gesture and embraced him from behind.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love you all,\u201d Suzuki said to the crowd.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kurt Suzuki and Donald Trump&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/DhwPTs3OCL\">pic.twitter.com\/DhwPTs3OCL<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Jake Russell (@_JakeRussell) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_JakeRussell\/status\/1191428042704470016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the team\u2019s longest-tenured member, thanked Trump for keeping the country safe and \u201ccontinuing to make America the greatest country in the world.\u201d He then handed the president a Nationals jersey with \u201cTrump 45\u201d on the back.<\/p>\n<p>All this took place in front of a large crowd that greeted Trump and the Nationals on a mild, sunny day. There were appearances from the big-headed Racing Presidents mascots, who looked oddly at home in front of the White House. And the Marine band played the children\u2019s song, \u201cBaby Shark\u201d \u2014 because, of course, it became the team\u2019s anthem for its magical year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had this many people on the front lawn of the White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cJust another record for the Nats.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t clear if Trump was talking about it being a record crowd during this presidency or in White House history. CBS News Correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps track of all sorts of statistics, said there were considerably more guests on the South Lawn of the White House during a 2008 appearance by Pope Benedict XVI.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">By the WH count there were approx 5,300 guests on the South Lawn for the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Nationals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nationals<\/a> event. Pres Trump said it was a record, but far from it. There were 13,500 guests on the South Lawn on April 16, 2008 for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI on his 81st birthday.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller\/status\/1191453305811156992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>Even so, there were some prominent no-shows as several players declined to attend. Relief pitcher Sean Doolittle said beforehand that he wouldn\u2019t go because he opposed Trump\u2019s words and deeds. Several other players didn\u2019t go, including stars Anthony Rendon and Victor Robles.<\/p>\n<p>Suzuki and Zimmerman aside, most of those who spoke during the ceremony directed their comments solely toward the Nationals\u2019 accomplishments and didn\u2019t mention Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Second baseman Howie Kendrick praised his teammates, saying, \u201cNo guy ever gave up. We all kept fighting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pitcher Stephen Strasburg referred to the team\u2019s slow start during the regular season, adding that beginning the year with a 19-31 record \u201conly makes this that much better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Manager Dave Martinez, whose own reputation fell and then rose with the team\u2019s performance, made light of the team\u2019s exuberant and boozy celebration at a Washington Capitals game Sunday night.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up too much time,\u201d he joked, \u201cbecause apparently, my boys don\u2019t like wearing shirts anymore.\u201d But Martinez turned emotional, saying how proud he was of his players and what the Nationals meant to the city.<\/p>\n<h4>Sports Tradition In The Trump Era<\/h4>\n<p>Though it&#8217;s been customary for champion teams to visit the White House since the Reagan administration, such visits to the White House have become controversial in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>A number of Latino and African American players from the Boston Red Sox boycotted a May meeting with Trump to celebrate the team&#8217;s 2018 Worlds Series victory. And the White House rescinded an invitation for the Philadelphia Eagles to accept congratulations for winning the 2018 Super Bowl after several players said they wouldn&#8217;t attend.<\/p>\n<p>The Washington Capitals did meet with Trump after they won the 2018 Stanley Cup. But there were a couple of defections from that visit, too, including star goalie Braden Holtby.<\/p>\n<p>Trump has not extended an invitation to the Washington Mystics, who won the WNBA championship last month.<\/p>\n<p>Doolittle told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/sports\/2019\/11\/01\/sean-doolittle-declining-white-house-invite-i-dont-want-hang-out-with-somebody-who-talks-like-that\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> Friday that he would not go to the White House, citing his stance against Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric about refugees and people of color.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy wife and I stand for inclusion and acceptance, and we\u2019ve done work with refugees, people that come from, you know, the \u2018shithole countries,\u2019\u201d Doolittle said. It was a reference to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting\/2018\/01\/11\/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html\">remarks Trump reportedly made<\/a> during a meeting with lawmakers last year, when talking about immigrants from\u00a0Haiti, El Salvador and African countries.<\/p>\n<p>Doolittle told the Post that he wanted to attend the White House event to support his teammates but couldn&#8217;t compromise his own beliefs to do so.<\/p>\n<p>The no-shows at the White House besides Doolittle, Rendon and Robles, included Joe Ross, Javy Guerra, Wander Suero, Wilmer Difo and Michael A.

Today, Diane continues to seek out insightful, well-informed guests who can help her, and her listeners, sift through the noise of the news media to get the answers they need and deserve.<\/p>\r\nFor 37 years, The Diane Rehm Show offered listeners thoughtful and lively conversations on an array of topics with many of the most distinguished people of our times. Each week, 2.8 million listeners across the country tuned in to the program, which grew from a small local morning call-in show on Washington\u2019s WAMU 88.5 to one of public broadcasting\u2019s most-listened-to programs. In Fall 2015 and Spring 2016, the show placed among the top ten most powerful public radio programs, based on its ability to draw listeners to public radio stations. It was the only live call-in talk show on the list. The final live Diane Rehm Show was broadcast on December 23, 2016.

The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re beyond thrilled,\u201d says Brandie Smith, director of the National Zoo. \u201cThe first time I walked through the panda house after the pandas had left, that was a really sad moment. But then we immediately turned our eyes toward the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>China has a monopoly on one of the cutest creatures in the animal kingdom &#8212; the native range of giant pandas is entirely within the country\u2019s borders. Today, there are roughly 2,000 of the animals lumbering around the bamboo-filled mountains of south central China.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the Chinese government has gifted or loaned pandas to zoos around the world. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s been called \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and it often coincides with trade deals or other diplomatic events. But as relations have soured in recent years between China and the U.S., China stopped renewing panda loans to U.S. zoos.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/travel\/2024\/02\/05\/pandas-atlanta-zoo-china-loan\/\">Atlanta is currently the last zoo in the country<\/a>\u00a0to have giant pandas, and they are set to return to China.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether international relations were at play in the D.C. panda negotiations, Smith said she couldn\u2019t comment. \u201cThat&#8217;s not really my area of expertise,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego Zoo is also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/01\/us\/pandas-china-san-diego-zoo.html\">set to get a new pair of pandas<\/a>\u00a0sometime soon, but no date has been announced.<\/p>\n<p>The 2-year-old bears heading to D.C. are named Bao Li and Qing Bao. Both were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan. Bao Li has D.C. roots, though: His mother, Bao Bao, was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2013\/12\/01\/248071531\/smithsonian-names-its-new-panda-cub-bao-bao\">born at the National Zoo<\/a>\u00a0in 2013 and was a local celebrity before being\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/02\/21\/516375441\/national-zoo-says-bye-bye-to-bao-bao\">sent to China<\/a>\u00a0in 2017.

While there, she happened to see Bao Li and immediately noted a resemblance with his grandfather, Tian Tian.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-secondary-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe were just falling on the floor, we just couldn&#8217;t believe how adorable he was. We just kept saying, we need that panda, we need him,\u201d Lally says. \u201cWe had no idea it would come to pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At age 2, pandas are considered \u201csub-adults,\u201d Lally says, comparable to the teenage years in a human lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey&#8217;re going to be a little cub-like, still really playful, and want to spend a lot of time in the trees playing with toys,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n<p>The new panda loan comes with terms similar to previous agreements. The loan has a term of 10 years, though previous loans have often been extended. Any cubs born to the pair will belong to China and must be sent back upon turning 4 years old. The National Zoo will pay $1 million a year to the China Wildlife and Conservation Association in exchange for the pandas, funds that are intended to support research and conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>After decades of international efforts to breed pandas and restore habitat, the animals are\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/07\/09\/1014593425\/china-giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn\">no longer considered endangered<\/a>. Giant pandas are now listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Chinese environmental officials.<\/p>\n<p>At the National Zoo, federal funding covers basic expenses like food and medicine for animals, but it doesn&#8217;t pay for the panda loan fee or cover the full cost of the panda program. The program has an annual budget of $2.8 million, including the fee. About three-quarters of that budget is funded by donations, zoo memberships and other sales.<\/p>\n<p>About 2 million people visit the National Zoo annually, and for many, the giant pandas have been the first and favorite stop. Smith says there hasn\u2019t been a noticeable decline in visitors since the<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>last pandas departed, but it\u2019s hard to tell because the zoo\u2019s busy season is just now ramping up. And, she says, there are plenty of other animals to see.<\/p>\n<aside id=\"ad-third-wrap\" aria-label=\"advertisement\"><\/aside>\n<p>\u201cWe know our visitors might come for the pandas, but they stay here for everything else,\u201d Smith says.<\/p>\n<p>While the panda habitat has been empty, the zoo has taken the opportunity to upgrade the building and outdoor space. Crews are currently at work building new fences, larger indoor and outdoor platforms, and ponds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure whatever we put in is going to be sturdy, especially with two young mischievous pandas that are probably going to try to take the whole place apart,\u201d Lally says.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>The last bears departed in November, bound for China on a FedEx cargo plane, with no agreement in place to secure a new pair.<\/p>\n","permalink":"https:\/\/wamu.org\/story\/24\/05\/29\/dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo\/","currentSlug":"dc-giant-pandas-return-national-zoo","created":"2024-05-29T11:35:51","modified":"2024-05-29T11:39:58","time":"May 29","timestamp":1716982551,"timestampGMT":1716996951,"imageData":{"caption":"<p>Giant Panda Tian Tian rests in its enclosure at the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Zoo in Washington, DC, on November 7, 2023, on the pants final day of viewing before returning to China.

Because of the city\u2019s strong blue tilt, the winners of the Democratic nomination are likely to emerge victorious in the general election in November. All the incumbents on the city council, minus Wilson, are running again in some capacity, with two seeking to become mayor and others hoping for another council term.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"story-aside\"><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Key dates to remember\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>May 28:<\/strong> deadline to register to vote or update an existing registration (voters may cast a provisional ballot after this date)<br \/>\n<strong>June 7:<\/strong> deadline for requesting a mailed ballot<br \/>\n<strong>June 15:<\/strong> final day of early in-person voting at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexandriava.gov\/elections\/key-absentee-voting-dates-deadlines\">Alexandria\u2019s registrar\u2019s office<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>June 18:<\/strong> Primary election day; polls are open 6 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m.<br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<p>There is no nominating contest for Republicans running for those local positions; Alexandria voters who request a Republican primary ballot will choose between five candidates hoping to secure the GOP\u2019s nod to run against incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Virginia has open primaries and no party registration, so you\u2019ll be asked which party\u2019s primary ballot you\u2019d like to vote.<\/p>\n<p>Alexandria politics has been particularly lively in the past year, the result of two high-profile debates about growth, housing, and economic development in the aftermath of the pandemic. Last fall, the City Council unanimously passed Zoning for Housing, a set of reforms to Alexandria\u2019s zoning code that included opening up single-family home lots to small multi-unit buildings, effectively ending single-family-only zoning in the city. Community controversy over the measure \u2014 which is expected to be followed by a \u2018Phase II\u2019 round of reforms in the future \u2014 has since hardened into an ongoing lawsuit between a group of Alexandria homeowners and the city over the process.<\/p>\n<p>Then, in December, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Mayor Wilson, and the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership announced preliminary plans to build a sports arena and entertainment complex in Potomac Yard, a prime plot of land next to Alexandria\u2019s long-awaited new Metro station. While the proposal died before the city council had a chance to vote on it, the plan sparked a wave of community pushback in Alexandria. Some residents expressed frustration with the current City Council, most of whom refused to dismiss the idea before it entered the city\u2019s regular zoning approval process.<\/p>\n<p>The arena debate highlighted the broader challenge the city faces in shoring up lagging commercial tax revenues, which currently account for only a fifth of the city\u2019s tax base. That imbalance will continue to confront the next mayor and city council \u2014 and their counterparts across Northern Virginia \u2014 as post-pandemic office vacancies persist.<\/p>\n<p>The primary election is also coming on the heels of a tight budget process and a 2.5-cent tax hike, which the council approved following extensive community advocacy for more funding for schools, affordable housing projects, and safety-net programs. Competing demands for public support to help mitigate the rising costs of living in Alexandria and to ensure a quality education for Alexandria\u2019s youngest residents are unlikely to go away anytime soon, either.<\/p>\n<p>On the Democratic primary ballot, voters will be able to choose one candidate for mayor and up to six for city council.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the candidates to weigh in on a series of questions about the city\u2019s future. Their unedited responses are below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to mayoral candidates: <a href=\"#Gaskins\">Alyia Gaskins<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Jackson\">Amy Jackson<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Peterson\">Steven Peterson<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Skip to City Council candidates: <a href=\"#Aguirre\">Canek Aguirre<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Bagley\">Sarah Bagley<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Chapman\">John Chapman<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#Elnoubi\">Abdel Elnoubi<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Greene\">Jacinta Greene<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Harris\">Kevin Harris<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Huskey\">Jonathan Huskey<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Lewis\">James Lewis<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#McPike\">Kirk McPike<\/a>* &#8211; <a href=\"#OConnell\">Jesse O\u2019Connell<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"#Scherer\">Charlotte Scherer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>*currently serving on City Council<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where can I find out more about the candidates?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are plenty of places to look for more information, including voter guides from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/05\/04\/alexandria-2024-democratic-primary-election-voter-guide\/\">The Washington Post<\/a> and urbanist site <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93523\/alexandria-arlington-2024-election\">Greater Greater Washington,<\/a> which also <a href=\"https:\/\/ggwash.org\/view\/93567\/gaskins-for-alexandria-mayor?emci=2555d4b0-3611-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=1a3ad829-3911-ef11-96f3-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=21556685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endorsed<\/a> in the mayoral contest.

From housing costs to property taxes to childcare, it is increasingly harder to live and age here. My childhood experiences in Pittsburgh shaped my commitment to ensuring that cities are places where everyone can thrive, which in turn has determined my professional path and my focus as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p>I was raised by a single mom who worked two jobs but struggled to make ends meet. We faced hunger and housing insecurity. I chose an education in public health, urban planning, and municipal finance because I wanted to make a difference. I have used these experiences professionally to advance food justice and housing policy, and I currently lead efforts to end homelessness at a national foundation.<\/p>\n<p>After a decade of working with local governments across the country and three years of being immersed in our city government, I know that when we recognize the connections between education, housing, public safety, and climate, we can plan in a way that maximizes benefits and mitigates unintended consequences. I know that when we make city government more accessible to all and amplify resident voices, we can ensure that our decisions take everyone into account and that all our services are delivered equitably and urgently. I am the only mayoral candidate with a proven record of getting results for all Alexandrians and the new ideas and energy to keep moving us forward, which is what our city needs to meet this moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed Potomac Yard Sports and Entertainment District was not just an arena. It was a 70-acre district with 9 million square feet of entertainment, restaurants, retail and housing, plus parks for all to enjoy. It could have brought 30,000 jobs and significant new tax revenue to our city. I still believe it could have been a good thing for Alexandria&#8211;if it included union jobs, affordable housing, funding for Metro and other district transit improvements, and more seats for Alexandria on the stadium authority board.<\/p>\n<p>Now that this project is off the table, it is time to move on from piecemeal decision-making and be comprehensive in our approach. We need a city-wide revenue generation plan that outlines how we can we take pressure off of residential taxes by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping small businesses open, stay open, and thrive;<\/li>\n<li>Working with the General Assembly to increase our authority to offer incentives for transformative developments;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Fostering more transit-oriented development at key sites including Potomac Yard, Braddock Road, Eisenhower East, and Van Dorn Metro stations; and<\/li>\n<li>Better leveraging existing tools like the Industrial Development Authority to foster creative deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Developing a city-wide economic development strategy is my top priority for my first months in office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We currently have a large backlog of approved projects in need of funding. On Council, I led the charge to increase dedicated funding for affordable housing, generating more than $5 million more each year, and to set aside ARPA funds to help purchase units in new construction for individuals and households with 40% AMI. As Mayor I am committed to working with staff to explore bond issuances to support affordable housing projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Yes, I voted for all eight of the Zoning for Housing proposals. I believe the set of proposals as a whole is an effective way to meet the diversity of Alexandria\u2019s housing needs&#8211;and the lengthy and thorough process with which the community vetted the initiative helped make it so. Zoning for Housing will help to create homes for more residents and alleviate some of the pressure on housing supply that has made it harder for people of all incomes to find and keep their housing. Moving forward, I would like to see:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay zones to address redevelopment pressure on existing residential buildings, which is a potential source of displacement.<\/li>\n<li>A reconsideration of parking requirements for new developments.<\/li>\n<li>The creation of a Unified Development Ordinance, a single document that includes all development-related regulations, including zoning and subdivision regulation and supports a more predictable and efficient development process. Alexandria has the components of such an ordinance but not all of the coordination\/connections that come with it.<\/li>\n<li>Strong tenant protection and anti-displacement policies. I realize these are not zoning policies, but they must be part of our housing policy agenda if we want to be intentional about advancing equitable outcomes. This is why I advocated for additional funding for the Housing Master Plan and have actively been working with our State Delegation to expand renter protections.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have to deliver a budget that is not only balanced but also holistically addresses all the challenges that impact our community\u2019s wellbeing. There are many services, from schools to public safety, that are important to who we are as a city. These services are a big reason Alexandria is a great place to live. They are core to our values.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, responsible financial stewardship is also one of our core values&#8211;and is the reason we have a AAA bond rating, which we want to keep.<\/p>\n<p>I am committed to being responsive to the short-term budget needs that keep our community special. However, when considering potential tax increases and sources of revenue for the city, we must plan not just for the immediate impacts, but also for the long-term effects on our residents and on our future budgets. This means we need to look beyond our residential taxes and find new ways to grow our revenue.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that my approach to this year\u2019s budget demonstrates my ability to not only understand these complex issues but also to listen to community concerns, work with my colleagues to weigh competing needs, and deliver results for our community, especially our children and teachers. I was proud to sponsor the only ACPS budget adjustments that were included in this budget. One will increase the operating transfer to the schools by 4M dollars. While we cannot tell ACPS how to spend the funds, I have indicated in the supporting memo that it is the Council&#8217;s hope that the funds be used for teacher salaries. The second budget adjustment is to help fund the construction of Cora Kelly and George Mason so that these much needed projects are not delayed. I also sponsored budget adjustments to expand property tax relief for seniors, fund youth ambassadors, and address our city\u2019s mental health crisis.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Jackson\"><\/a>Amy Jackson<\/h5>\n<p>Amy Jackson currently serves on the City Council as Alexandria&#8217;s vice mayor, and previously was an educator.

As the son of immigrants I also understand what life is like for many immigrant families.

We need to seek revenue through more tax authority from the General Assembly, grants, federal and state money, public-private partnerships and exploring creative policies like the ARISE program or housing vouchers. Expanding the commercial tax base by attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses will be a crucial component as well. If we are unable to procure sufficient funds from those sources, we are left with very few options beyond raising the real estate tax rate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> I was a vocal proponent of Zoning for Housing and was pleased that it was a unanimous vote.

Each year I carefully weigh the needs of the schools with the needs of all the other city services we provide residents and businesses. Strong communities have strong schools, and it is clear from the City\u2019s budget that we value education here in Alexandria because it is the single largest expenditure (roughly one third of the entire budget). The reality is Alexandria is hurt by the way the state formula for school funding is set up as we receive very little state money. We essentially have to fund 80-90% of the schools\u2019 budget from city coffers while there are other localities in Virginia that have their schools funded almost entirely by the state. The current state formula ignores the needs that we have as a community and I will continue to fight to have this changed by the General Assembly. Additionally, we are in dire need of diversifying our tax base to generate more revenue for our community.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Bagley\"><\/a>Sarah Bagley<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049088\" style=\"width: 876px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049088\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"876\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-803x1024.jpg 803w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-706x900.jpg 706w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Bagley-e1715610969317-471x600.jpg 471w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Sarah Bagley.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Sarah Bagley campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sarah Bagley is a current member of the City Council and the executive director of a housing nonprofit.

A specific experience that informs my approach to elected leadership involves a resident whom I helped secure housing in an affordable housing community. While it was gratifying to help someone who had been formerly incarcerated and dealt with substance abuse to receive housing, it was a short-lived feeling of accomplishment for me and the resident as she continued to face challenges maintaining her unit, paying her portion of rent, and complying with the lease terms. It was clear to me and has remained key to my approach to city government and community building, that without a more holistic approach to supportive services, and a community of people engaged with this resident, housing alone was not enough. It also demonstrated the often-siloed approach we take to housing issues, employment issues, mental health and substance abuse, and financial literacy. For individuals, dealing with these items separately can be an immense burden and as elected leaders, we have an obligation to create structures and services that work best for everyone. If we build structures and services that work well for disabled persons, for seniors, for youth, for nonbinary people, for those dealing mental health or substance abuse issues, we will inevitably have structures that work for all. This is and will continue to be my goal as an elected leader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While Alexandria needs to diversity its tax base and grow commercial investment in the City, we are fortunate that we have millions of square feet of entitled space available for development and other developable areas in highly attractive corridors near transit and services in the Landmark area, Eisenhower Valley, Van Dorn Metro and Potomac Yard. We need to pursue both larger scale opportunities in the entertainment, education\/office or retail space that may require public private partnerships, financial investments by the City in supportive infrastructure, and creative investment tools such as that applied by the IDA to assist The Art League secure the funding they needed to stay in Alexandria and complete their renovations at The Muse. We should continue to listen to the business community and facilitate their permitting and planning processes to lower the costs and barriers to business development in the City and be sure that this assistance is applied not only to larger entities like PTO and Inova but smaller organizations and businesses in the City. We must be competitive with our neighboring jurisdictions and recognize that we will need to provide attractive housing and transit options to businesses so they can be confident that their employees and potential customers can live nearby and readily access their ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

The ARISE program is a strong tool against displacement, providing families earning at or below 50% of AMI the ability to continue paying bills, often rent, and managing their budgets as we build and create more market rate and committed affordable housing in the city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I am proud that in the FY25 budget we identified an additional $3 million dollars to dedicate to the affordable housing trust fund. As we move forward, we need to evaluate the best options regarding additional funding streams beyond the 1% on the meals tax to include potentially sources from our hotel taxes, admission and other taxes, and ways to commit over a long period of time additional funding from real estate and other sources. Where on site units are not advisable or preferential, we should continue to apply our formula for trust fund investments by development to insure we have access to cash for our approved projects.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative?<\/strong> Yes, I voted for and supported Zoning for Housing. Depending on the data we receive from the implementation of Phase I, and additional information from jurisdictions that are making similar upzoning changes to their codes, I would like to see us continue to evaluate parking minimums (which would not eliminate parking in developments or neighborhoods but would allow the market and customer interest to determine the parking provided rather than a set formula). We should also continue to look for ways to simplify and reduce the number of residential zones we use to the extent that our complex model complicates and delays housing development.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

In the future, as in this cycle, we must be willing and able to address urgent needs as well as those which may not have as vocal or organized a constituency, such as the needs in mental health services examined during this budget process. To weigh ACPS needs against other budget priorities, I commit to continue asking questions of staff about the challenges facing departments throughout the City and with our partner agencies like the Sheriff department, Library, Visit Alexandria and the Clerk of Court\u2019s office. Though the public may not be as aware and prepared to advocate for those entities, it is our obligation to ensure that the entirety of our city government is well funded and functioning properly. Where we can lobby and seek through legislation increased funding from Richmond for ACPS and other entities, we must increase those efforts as well so the burden to address priorities can be shared with state level support as well.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Chapman\"><\/a>John Chapman<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049093\" style=\"width: 1680px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049093\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/JohnChapmanheadshots_2024-2-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>John Chapman.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy John T.

ACPS also suffered losing tens of positions due to expiration of ESSER (COVID relief funds) which caused the need for additional funds from the City Council. This will not always be the case. I will however use my intimate understanding of the ACPS budget and weigh those needs and arguments from the School Board with needs of other City departments while examining relevant data closely. It\u2019s also worth noting that many other City departments provide services that directly or indirectly impact the Schools, therefore funding other city services addressing mental health, food and housing insecurities will directly benefit the Schools.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Greene\"><\/a>Jacinta Greene<\/h5>\n<p>Jacinta Greene is a current member of the Alexandria School Board and works for a marketing and events company.

I was raised by a single, working-class mother who was not highly educated. We bounced around living with different family members. Seeing her struggle to provide for us shaped my outlook on the world. Eventually, my mother, wanting me to have greater opportunities in my life, chose to have me live with my uncle in Alexandria.<\/p>\n<p>My upbringing taught me valuable lessons about respect. True worth doesn&#8217;t come from wealth or education; everyone deserves respect, a chance to succeed, and a voice in our community. We are stronger when everyone has a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Those experiences from my childhood is why I love Alexandria, and why I chose to get active in our community in the first place. All of my work, whether that\u2019s as a community organizer, as the President of the ARHA City Wide Resident Association, as a member of the ARHA Board of Commissioners, as a Minister, as a coach, as a business owner, and as a father, is done to ensure that the City of Alexandria is able to provide to others the opportunities it provided me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s why I spent the last decade championing equity in Alexandria. As a community organizer, I&#8217;ve tirelessly advocated for marginalized voices to be heard. From organizing in public housing communities, to advocating for increased minority representation on City Boards and Commissions, to spearheading the push to get Alexandria\u2019s Sunday Voting approved, to organizing with small business owners setting up the Alexandria Minority Business Association, to working on outreach to less represented communities while serving as the Deputy Chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, my mission has been to uplift everyday Alexandrians.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that\u2019s the role of local elected officials &#8211; To proactively reach out and listen to everyday Alexandrians, and to then work tirelessly to provide tangible results that address the needs of our community members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though the underlying concerns regarding the lack of diversity within our tax base is valid, relying on using taxpayer money for a sports arena that the majority of our community members didn\u2019t want, was not a good way to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p>There are other ways to address our revenue concerns. For example, Alexandria\u2019s commercial property tax rate is lower than all of our surrounding jurisdictions, and is the exact same as our residential tax rate. Arlington, for example, has a $1.03 residential property tax rate, and a $1.155 commercial property tax rate. DC has a $0.85 residential property tax rate, and a $1.89 commercial property tax rate. Fairfax County has a $1.184 residential property tax rate and a $1.298 commercial property tax rate. Aligning our commercial property tax rate with our surrounding jurisdictions would alleviate some of the pressure on the budget.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, places like Washington DC have an additional vacant property tax and Air BnB tax as a way to incentivize those landlords to ensure that their properties are available for rent and are a part of our housing stock. Looking into a similar style would not only increase revenue, but it would also help increase our housing supply, something that is desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we as a community need to be forward thinking about our financial investments in our community to ensure that we are building our tax base without pushing the members of our community who built our community out of the City.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing that we use the proposed Monumental Arena site as a site for workforce housing, primarily for our City employees. It costs the City over $175,000 to recruit and train each new firefighter in Alexandria, and we\u2019re losing approximately 30 firefighters per year. That\u2019s over $5 million, annually, simply due to our inability to retain fire personnel. And with less than 10% of our entire fire department living in the City of Alexandria, it makes sense that our firefighters are leaving to work in jurisdictions closer to their home.<\/p>\n<p>This is an issue we need to address. What would it look like if we were to use the proposed Monumental Arena site to build workforce housing for these employees? How much can we save, annually, by doing so? And what are the magnitude of the other economic benefits of a proposal like this? By having our employees live in the City, their property taxes will be paid to the City. When they go to the grocery store, it\u2019ll be in the City.<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of potential solutions that I want to propose when elected to Council. Solutions that are real solutions, that follow our City\u2019s moral compass, and would benefit all members of our community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> YES &#8211; This program is an investment in our community and the families of our community. As someone who has experienced this both as a child, and as a coach and youth mentor, I can promise you this: Kids who don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from don\u2019t care about long division. By investing in the most economically hardships families in our community, we are investing in the future of our high risk kids. This is the type of program that will pay dividends to all of our community members. In addition, I\u2019d like to add an investment and money management education\/strategies component to the program. Provided resources is great, but ensuring our community members have access to financial literacy education programs would ensure the sustainability of these families.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> In addition to the tax proposals listed above, Alexandria could adopt a DC style approach to vacant property taxes on AirBnBs &#8211; in DC, residential properties pay $0.85 per $100 of assessed value &#8211; but vacant properties are charged $5.00 per $100 of assessed value, creating pressure on landlords to rent their properties at lower rates. We should do something similar to that on vacant and Airbnb properties, pushing the Airbnb properties back into the housing stock. City Council also has the power to vote no on any projects that do not build enough affordable housing units, or to vote no on density increases that do not provide a substantial affordable housing offset. We need to use these tools in our negotiations with developers. People want to build in Alexandria &#8211; We have Metro, we\u2019re right next to DC, we have a highly educated workforce and a high AMI. Let\u2019s ensure that our morals and values are being fought for during negotiations to ensure that we get as many affordable housing units as possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes. As a member of the VOICE Strategy team, I was part of the coalition that helped push for Zoning for Housing. But it needs to be stronger. Currently there is no requirement to have dedicated affordable housing units with this increase in density. We need to create a system where the bonus density is more directly tied to the amount of affordable units being built, and use the powers granted to Council to ensure developments benefit the members of our community. While over the long term, increasing supply should hypothetically decrease the cost of housing units, however, with demand being as high as it is in Alexandria, I do not believe we can solely rely on the free market to fix our affordable housing crisis. We need to incentivize the creation of dedicated affordable housing units, and not approve projects that increase this disparity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have four daughters &#8211; Three of them are current ACPS students, while the oldest just graduated from Alexandria City High School last year.<\/p>\n<p>As a father, I firmly believe we need to do whatever it takes to fund our schools properly every year. Public safety, schools and transportation are the core functions of local government. If they\u2019re our priorities, then we need to treat them as such during the budget process.<\/p>\n<p>Investments in schools will also help with public safety. Activities after school, and having a safe environment in the schools, decrease the likelihood of our students getting caught up in trouble with law enforcement.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Huskey\"><\/a>Jonathan Huskey<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049091\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049091\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-939x1024.jpg 939w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-825x900.jpg 825w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Huskey_ACC2-e1715611683860-550x600.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jonathan Huskey.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Jonathan Huskey campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jonathan Huskey is the communications director at State Revenue Alliance, a progressive tax policy advocacy organization.

To paraphrase JFK, these inspiring people fought the good fight not because it was easy, but because it was hard. With that in mind, the least I can do as an Alexandria City Council member is to imagine our city the way it could be and should be, and make the hard choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My job is to help organizations and communities raise revenue at the state level by demanding the rich pay their fair share. I know that our local tax system is upside down, and so are City Council\u2019s priorities. This year, the City spent $700,000 lobbying for the Potomac Yard Arena and ignored a billion-dollar revenue raising bill that could help fund our schools by adding a new tax bracket for millionaires. I\u2019ll fight for tax fairness in Richmond and in Alexandria. We\u2019ll have to make some hard choices in the short term, but if elected I will offer a policy to expand a tax rebate program for low- and moderate-income households so they aren\u2019t taxed out of their homes. We also need to continue investing in our hospitality and tourism industries, and work on high-density development that is appropriate for Potomac Yard and the Eisenhower Valley. We have a great city that can attract major business opportunities, and we have the responsibility to utilize it in the best interests of our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

These impactful programs, like ARISE, deliver lasting change in people\u2019s lives. A short term extension would defeat the goals of the program and would be fundamentally unjust \u2014 pulling the rug out from under working families who are advancing along the path to the American Dream. I would advocate for Council to include income support programs like ARISE in its regular budgeting process because they are important tools to address inequality and build an economy that works for everyone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> I\u2019m appreciative of the work the current Council has done to bring new projects forward. Using bonding and working with nonprofits, along with other creative funding solutions, would jump-start projects already underway and provide the impetus for homeownership opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>While I applaud the Housing for All initiative and support other policies under the Zoning for Housing umbrella, I would not have supported the elimination of single-family zones. Gaining 150-180 units over 10 years without any way to ensure long-term affordability doesn\u2019t justify the public division this policy caused. I will not support additional zoning changes in what were single family zones unless we get our priorities straight \u2014 turning down the heat and meeting the need. I will support housing initiatives that build wealth and are tied to long-term solutions for housing instability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

If we were able to win major tax reform in Richmond in 2026 with a Democratic Governor, we could see additional resources for our schools. In the meantime, this Council has raised the property tax this year to fully fund ACPS. I will advocate for the school system in budget negotiations and also expand property tax rebate programs for long-term homeowners, and those with moderate or low incomes.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The need to diversify Alexandria\u2019s tax base away from its over-dependency on residents could not be clearer. I have a three-pronged approach for commercial growth in the City. In the short-term, we need to continue and likely expand investments in AEDP and Visit Alexandria, which offer significant returns on investment. Second, we need to foster our local retail base, including creating a local retail incubator. Finally, we need to work with AEDP to retain larger entities into the Potomac Yard, Landmark, Eisenhower Valley and former Potomac River power plant sites.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we must address the bureaucratic hurdles that business owners face to get started in Alexandria. We cannot have businesses paying rent without cash flow for months while awaiting an occupancy permit. We need to increase the number and type of permits issued administratively, streamline internal City approval processes, and reduce the number of offices an entrepreneur must visit to get their business started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> Alexandria needs to get more creative when it comes to finding project funding.

As a member of the Alexandria City Council, I have endeavored to incorporate what I have learned from those experiences into my work on behalf of residents. In my professional career, I have also served as chief of staff to a member of the Texas Legislature and, for the last twelve years, to Congressman Mark Takano. In those roles, I had the honor of helping constituents in times of crisis and supporting my bosses when they had to make tough decisions on important pieces of legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revitalizing Alexandria\u2019s commercial tax base will be a key challenge facing the next few terms of the Alexandria City Council. We have real assets and potential opportunities to increase commercial activity in the City of Alexandria. We have an open space in Potomac Yard next to the new metro station. We have major opportunities to create economic vitality along Eisenhower Avenue. The new hospital at the former Landmark mall site will be the crown jewel of the West End of Alexandria, and the redeveloped coal power plant site will create a compelling waterfront that extends from the Potomac River Generating Station through the North Old Town Arts District, historic Old Town, and down to the Jones Point Lighthouse. There won\u2019t be anything else in the region quite like it, and it\u2019s something we can build on. Alexandria\u2019s already underperforming\/weakened office space market has insulated us somewhat from the collapse in commercial land values, but it also makes it harder for us to address our revenue imbalance. I think that our next step should be to invite our entire community to contribute to the vision for what economic development looks like in Alexandria. That\u2019s why I supported the FY 2025 budget proposal to hold an economic summit with local and regional business leaders, our economic development agency, and other experts to update our economic development strategy and plan for brighter days ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher. Alexandria lost 62% of its market-rate affordable rentals between 2000 and 2021, and lower-income residents are at risk of displacement. Please answer the following briefly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do you support an expansion of Alexandria\u2019s guaranteed-income pilot program?<\/strong> Yes. Early indicators from this pilot program suggest that investments like this increase the physical and emotional health of our most vulnerable residents while cutting through the time intensive red tape of applying for support services. While the final results aren\u2019t complete, I support taking the results of the ARISE pilot study and using it as a guide to creating a permanent program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> On Council, I supported an expansion of our committed funding to affordable housing from our property tax revenues, and this year dedicated $3 million in one-time funds to help get these projects moving. I support widening the dedicated streams of funding into our housing trust fund to more quickly fund projects that are approved.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong>Yes, I voted in favor of Zoning for Housing. I believe that we should analyze the results of this first set of reforms, and use them to determine how to further strengthen our housing-creation tools. If we aren\u2019t hitting our housing-creation projections, then we will need to push forward on expanded reforms. I believe that portions of the ZFH package related to historic development patterns, transit-oriented development, and industrial zones are particularly improvable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis. If elected, how would you weigh the needs of ACPS with other budget priorities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every year, I have made funding for ACPS a priority in my budget considerations, and this year I co-authored a $4 million increase in the operating budget for our schools, and supported a $65 million increase in funding for school construction, which taken together result in almost $9 million in new, recurring annual spending for ACPS. I will always work closely with our School Board members to support our schools, and will continue to listen to our students and parents about the needs they see. I support looking into committing a dedicated portion of our property tax revenues to our schools, to make it easier for ACPS and the City to plan their budgets and to coordinate on funding questions.<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"&quot;#OConnell\"><\/a>Jesse O&#8217;Connell<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049098\" style=\"width: 915px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049098\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"1108\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-846x1024.jpg 846w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-743x900.jpg 743w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Moore-Campaigns-Mark-Parker-Balt.-Md-2.26.24-Barrett-7251-1-e1715611218522-495x600.jpg 495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Jesse O&#8217;Connell.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy of Jesse O'Connell campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Jesse O&#8217;Connell works in higher education policy at the American Council on Education.

The city then\u2013as now\u2013was justifiably interested in a higher and better use of this key piece of public land, yet we were not at that time in a financial position to do anything with that property were we to bring it back under direct city control. That experience showed me how urgent it is to plan for the future and create financial flexibility, so that we are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they inevitably arise. This includes staying in constant dialogue with residents about possible projects, both keeping them informed and educated about various possibilities as well as listening to what they\u2019re interested in, and shaping that feedback into long-term plans. We cannot simply react in the moment or we will miss out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Discussions about the arena deal underscored widespread concerns about Alexandria\u2019s lagging commercial tax base in the hybrid work era. What avenues do you think the city should explore to diversify its tax base and shift some of the burden off of residential taxpayers?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a former chair of the city\u2019s budget commission, I am keenly aware of the need to pursue transformational economic development projects; both to bring needed balance to the city\u2019s tax base by increasing commercial development, as well as to grow the overall amount of revenue being raised by the city. We must continue to pursue large-scale opportunities that are aligned with the city\u2019s values and meet our community\u2019s needs in Carlyle, the Eisenhower Valley, at the Braddock metro station, near the in-progress Landmark project, in addition to future attempts at a more dynamic vision for Potomac Yard.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a vocal advocate for transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods, as I think these things have the double bottom line of building community relationships while advancing toward our environmental goals. Economic development is also contingent on key underlying infrastructure\u2013on council I would support continued investment in DASH Bus (whose board I currently serve on) and funding for Metro, as development around transit hubs must first flow from frequent and well-maintained transit. Walkable neighborhoods are fostered through ongoing investment in pedestrian safety measures in addition to a business environment that allows for neighborhood-serving retail across a wide variety of areas, ensuring that people can socialize and complete core errands and every day tasks within a safe and convenient walk from where they live.<\/p>\n<p>I think the way forward is to be creative and flexible about the kinds of resources we bring to bear on these projects to get them going. Coordinated development districts, use of various public bond authorities, economic incentive programs similar to what Fairfax County has used successfully, and continued support for the organizations in Alexandria that steward our relationships and activities related to thriving enterprise: AEDP, Visit Alexandria, and the Chamber ALX.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Housing costs in the D.C. region are high and getting higher.

I am steadfast in my belief that the heart of any strong community is a well-funded and well-run public school system, not only for needed educational outcomes but because of the socialization they foster and the personal bonds they build between students and parents alike. The needs of ACPS will always be a priority to me, not the least because our city transfer of around $280m to our schools makes up about 30% of the FY25 budget; we have to make sure we get a budget commitment of that magnitude right. It is absolutely necessary for City Council to have a strong, collaborative relationship with both our school board and ACPS leadership so that when their budget requests come forward they are meeting core needs like teacher pay first, and that they shape their overall ask in the context of possibility efficiencies with other city provided services (like maintenance and transportation).<\/p>\n<h5><a name=\"#Scherer\"><\/a>Charlotte Scherer<\/h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7049090\" style=\"width: 648px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7049090\" src=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-236x300.png 236w, https:\/\/wamu.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Charlotte-Scherer-473x600.png 473w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text caption\"><span>Charlotte Scherer.<\/span> <span class=\"credits photo-credit\">Courtesy Charlotte Scherer campaign<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Charlotte Scherer is an attorney and a former city magistrate.

The city created a control group that did not receive cash assistance to compare the outcomes. The $3 million in federal Covid money the city used to begin the experimental pilot will run out just as some propose \u201cexpanding\u201d the program. This would create a citywide entitlement program. How would it operate? Would the monthly benefit become a permanent entitlement for those chosen by lottery? Would the income remained \u201cguaranteed\u201d even if city revenue fell unexpectedly? Given these concerns, I cannot endorse turning an experiment into a permanent cash benefit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>There are several affordable housing projects already approved by the city but stalled due to lack of funds. What avenues do you think the city should explore to fund its ambitious affordable housing production and preservation goals?<\/strong> We are building extensively but not creating greater affordability. In 2019, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) set ambitious regional goals for housing creation. After five years, Alexandria has exceeded its target by 130%, surpassing the progress of other localities such as Montgomery County (57%), Prince William County (27%), and Manassas (12%). We as a city have built more housing in those five years than most counties, but only<a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2024\/04\/10\/dc-regional-housing-targets\/__;!!IaT_gp1N!1LwpislwW9qu61QJoaOdHMXOxxZzSstfNiiLbgw8UXIrLovyBiEsacT0Uwn8bx-3wNC5FTcMeGbBNaVUHKU$\"> seven percent<\/a> of that construction boom is affordable housing. A more targeted strategy would involve requiring developers to allocate one-third of each new project for affordable housing. A pattern of approving additional projects that ultimately stall is not a sign of progress. Instead, it is a sign of a city council that continually struggles to balance its ambitious plans with the resources and means necessary to achieve them.<\/li>\n<li><strong><strong>Did you support Zoning for Housing, and what strategies (if any) would you like to see the city explore in Phase II of the policy initiative? <\/strong><\/strong>Zoning for Housing encourages development. It doesn\u2019t require it to be affordable. Building for higher density in an existing neighborhood requires developers to buy and demolish single- family homes to make way for modern duplexes priced for profit. The high cost of land and construction create the incentive to build luxury duplexes rather than affordable ones. The remaining single-family homes become fewer and pricier themselves. The unrestricted high-density construction then pushes out middle-income residents who can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. This simply rewards developers for new construction. I support creating incentives for developers to build affordably rather than further experimental changes to the zoning code.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Funding for Alexandria City Public Schools has been a key issue in this budget cycle, with the school board, parents and teachers calling for an additional $10 million, which they believe could address the schools\u2019 staffing crisis.

This is not the $8.7 million that mostly would have gone directly to teachers\u2019 salaries. It is a decision to shore up the capital improvement budget at the expense of paying our teachers what they should be paid. The best strategy is to pay our teachers better and send less money to the builders.<\/p>\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>It\u2019s a crowded field in the city\u2019s Democratic primary.
