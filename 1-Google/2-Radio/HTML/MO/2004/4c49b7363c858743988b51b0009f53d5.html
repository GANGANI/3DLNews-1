    <td valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF">My reason for doing the song &quot;In 
      the Company of Women&quot; is really quite simple. Like Lee, I love to be 
      around women. This song with its unique structure was one that fit my style 
      of singing and playing as well as one that reflects my beliefs, attitudes, 
      and values. After all, whether they are merely good friends, best friends, 
      or passionate lovers, what better way is there to spend one's time on planet 
      earth than in the company of women? </font></td>
    <td><font color="#FFFFFF">This song was written in the summer of 1982 in Crested 
      Butte, Colorado. The inspiration for the song came from two sources: (1) 
      an evening spent hanging out in town with a friend, Bob Teitler, and two 
      young women from Kansas he had befriended; (2) an absence in my heart left 
      by the return to Missouri of my mate and soon-to-be-wife, Rena, who had 
      spent a few weeks with me in Crested Butte but who'd felt the call of duty 
      to return home and resume preparations for our impending move out to Happy 
      Hollow in Moniteau County, Missouri. (In retrospect, I realize that had 
      I been a more dutiful mate, I would have returned with her. But I was fixated 
      on letting my summer in the mountains play out to its natural end, and I'd 
      decided to return home and rejoin her in a few weeks. Again in retrospect, 
      I also realize that there would have been two less songs for this album, 
      and a different album title.) So, anyway, an enjoyable evening spent, in 
      part, in the company of women reminded me how much I truly did enjoy the 
      company of women, setting up the first and last verse of the song, while 
      the ongoing presence in my life of a mate, coupled with her immediate absence, 
      gave me a particular and singular woman to focus the song upon, setting 
      up the chorus and the middle verses. Almost twenty-two years later, we're 
      still together, working together to make sense of and adjust to our recent 
      move from the country back into town, and the song still fits my voice and 
      my life in pretty much the same way that it did back in August of 1982.</font></td>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The first time I recall ever seeing Lee Ruth was 
        during the fall of 1969 when I saw him outside playing his guitar and 
        singing a folk song on a sidewalk in Columbia. Apparently celebrating 
        the beautiful fall weather with his music, he was leaning up against a 
        brick building near the Heidelberg in Columbia directly across from the 
        University of Missouri's journalism school where he had gathered quite 
        an audience. I was a young kid of 19 years at the time. I was from a small 
        Missouri town and had just enrolled in college as an undergraduate at 
        MU. I had never seen anything quite like Lee Ruth before nor had I ever 
        heard live folk music and guitar work that was so good. I remember thinking 
        at the time, to hell with school, I just want to get to know this guy 
        and have him teach me how to play the guitar. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Eventually I was fortunate enough to get to know 
        Lee as both my guitar teacher and a good friend. Since 1969, I have spent 
        around 30 years in and out of Columbia, Missouri. When I am in town for 
        any considerable length of time, I go see Lee for a few guitar lessons 
        and to get feedback on my original songs. I am still going to school at 
        MU working on a Ph.D. While Lee Ruth is not listed as a part of my degree 
        program, perhaps he should be. I have been studying guitar with him off 
        and on ever since the time I first met him. He has become a vital part 
        of my education whether I am in or out of town. When I am out of town 
        and I write and produce a few songs, I send them to Lee for feedback and 
        he occasionally plays a few of my original songs on his radio show. Lee 
        has been a very important influence on my life and my music. It is truly 
        an honor to be able to play one of his songs on the new CD.</font></p>

    <td valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF">Joey is one of those larger-than-life 
      characters that we sometimes meet. Our paths first crossed in 1969, but 
      it was probably 1974 or so when we actually got to know each other. He had 
      a deeper-than-the-average-bear voice, and it was music, specifically guitar 
      music, that formed our common ground over the years, as he drifted in and 
      out of Columbia (living for extended periods of time in other places), yet 
      I never have figured out whether it is music or theater that has the greater 
      hold on him. I do remember seeing him give a convincing performance as Lee, 
      the spiritedly dysfunctional brother in Sam Shepard's play &quot;True West,&quot; 
      at the University of Missouri's Rhynsburger Theater in the late 1980s. On 
      many occasions he has brought me recordings of songs he has written, and 
      I've helped him with a variety of guitar-learning projects he's undertaken 
      at different times and for different reasons. These days he lives most of 
      the year in south Texas, but it seems like he returns to Columbia every 
      summer, and I always look forward to his return and never quite know what 
      to expect from him. Surprise me. </font></td>
