      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It was great fun playing &quot;Mondolina&quot; 
        with Lee and Jim on the project. This is a superb instrumental tune, with 
        lots of room for personal expression. </font> </p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jim Ruth on &quot;Mondolina&quot;:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I'd heard Lee play &quot;Mondolina&quot; over 
        the years but had never played it myself until we began rehearsing for 
        the recording. The piece fits nicely into the mold of the fiddle and banjo 
        pieces I am used to playing, so it was not too much of a stretch. We like 
        how the three instruments blend yet remain distinct. I played a nylon-stringed 
        banjo to differentiate it more from the mandolin.<br>
        Lee, Rusty (now Howard, in his old age), and I played bluegrass together 
        around 1969-1970. We had a lot of trouble controlling tempo and darned 
        if it wasn't d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again thirty years later! 
        &quot;Mondolina&quot; is a delicate piece but with some bouncy sections 
        that we tended to speed up. Eventually we got tired of messing it up and 
        managed to marshal our concentration enough for a good take.</font></p>
      </td>
    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#000000" valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF">Between 
      1992 and 1998, I played a weekly gig Wednesday nights at the Hartsburg Hitching 
      Post in Hartsburg, Missouri. At some point during the course of a typical 
      Wednesday evening, I would find myself at a loss for what to play next, 
      and frequently my solution would be to pick up an instrument and start noodling. 
      &quot;Mondolina&quot; evolved out of just such noodling--a riff or motif 
      on the mandolin that I remembered from one week to the next. Over a period 
      of many months, it evolved into a tune with three parts, which I liked well 
      enough to keep in my active repertoire. When this project got underway, 
      I wanted to get my brother involved, and playing a tune with him seemed 
      to be the most likely way to achieve that. Since I had several original 
      mandolin instrumentals, we decided on a banjo-mandolin duet, which we then 
      decided to expand into a melody trio by adding our friend Howard &quot;Rusty&quot; 
      Marshall on fiddle, and we picked this tune as the one we wanted to do.

    <td width="50%" valign="top" bgcolor="#000000">
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I've known Lee since the 1960s. We met around 1967, 
        when I was back in school at the University of Missouri after being in 
        the Marine Corps. We did a lot of jamming with various pickers in McAlester 
        Park on South 9th Street next to the J-School, including Jim Ruth when 
        Jim was at Hickman High and working out his elaborate melodic banjo tunes. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We hung out at the old Ivanhoe Restaurant, where 
        we played on a regular basis in the late 1960s in a number of different 
        acoustic bands. Lee, Jim, and I played together there, and at the Chez 
        Coffeehouse, and formed a band and played a number of gigs at Max's Shakespeare's 
        Pizza) and other places around Mid-Mo. Lee and I also played in another 
        band about that time, with an engineering grad student who played great 
        Scruggs-style banjo, Doug DeMaire, and that trio played a lot of gigs 
        around Columbia in about 1968. I remember some lovely evenings picking 
        music at Lee's house, and enjoying his immense collection of vintage recordings 
        and tapes (which he tended to archive in frozen pizza <br>
        boxes). </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Lee and I also traveled to some memorable places 
        and events together, including the Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival in 
        Indiana (where Lee played backup guitar for the great bluegrass fiddler 
        Kenny Baker), and several trips to the Ozarks Folk Festival (Mountain 
        View) and to visit with fiddlers and pickers in Springfield MO. At that 
        time, I played mostly mandolin and guitar and sang tenor, and we did a 
        lot of bluegrass as well as country songs we stole from Merle Haggard 
        and George Jones. I learned a <br>
        lot about guitar playing from hanging out with Lee and from our performances 
        together. He remains the &quot;super picker's super picker&quot; in my 
        book, and beyond that, Lee Ruth is a fine human being. It is a great privilege 
        to be part of this project to honor Lee. </font><font color="#FFFFFF">Howard 
        Marshall</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> My big brother Lee introduced me to the kind of 
        music where you get to play it your own way. When he brought home a five-string 
        banjo sometime around 1964 I was transfixed by the thing and haven't been 
        able to get banjos out of my life since! Lee taught me a basic frailing 
        style which evolved into my present way of playing.<br>
        In addition, Lee was (and is) an advocate for my musical interests. He 
        took me to many folk and bluegrass festivals, fiddle contests, and other 
        events. He was always ready to play guitar backup for some new tune I 
        wanted to try out.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Lee knew what was behind the folk revival and 
        had a record collection containing some of the best examples of country 
        blues, bluegrass, and old-time music. I might never have been exposed 
        to this intense, compelling music otherwise. After all, there was no KOPN 
        back then!<br>
        Though our music has taken different directions, we place the same value 
        on individual style in our musical endeavors.</font>d<font color="#FFFFFF">Jim

    <td width="50%" bgcolor="#000000" valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF">Jim Ruth 
      </font> 
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I think it's safe to say that Jim is the person 
        on this album that I have known the longest--since the day after Christmas 
        1950, when he was one day old. Even though I'm ten years older than he 
        is, in a way he started picking before I did, as one of our sister Peggy's 
        friends gave him a cracked ukulele to fool around with several months 
        before I got my first guitar. He was five years old, and I must say that 
        he got some interesting sounds out of it. He really didn't get seriously 
        playing fretted instruments until his early teen years when I left my 
        banjo (which had a small rip in the head) at the house for a year or so. 
        I'd come by the house and plunk on it a bit, and he'd say, &quot;What 
        are you doing? It looks like your hand is just going up and down but I'm 
        hearing all these melody notes along with the chords.&quot; So, I'd slow 
        down the hand and finger motion of double thumbing while frailing and 
        he'd say, &quot;Aha!&quot; Two weeks later I would come by and he'd be 
        frailing the tar out of my poor old broken-headed banjo--playing it better 
        even then, I dare say, than I am now, some forty years later. With his 
        sure hands and gifted ear, it didn't take him long to be a good picker 
        on a variety of instruments, and not too much longer to be a great player 
        on some of them. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Over the years he has found his musical niche and 
        I mine, and we don't seem to find as much time to play together as we 
        once did, but I always enjoy doing so, and I consider it an honor that 
        I had a chance to play with him on this tune.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        Howard &quot;Rusty&quot; Marshall</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I probably met Rusty around 1966 or so, perhaps 
        through Keith Cunningham or Dan Peek. We found opportunities to play together 
        around Columbia and down in Mountain View, Arkansas, and in the fall of 
        l968 we put together a little bluegrass band called &quot;The Sixtyniner 
        String Band&quot; in Columbia, which hung together for the school year 
        and recorded two songs for an album called &quot;Joint Effort&quot; at 
        the Chez Coffeehouse in Columbia. When the banjo player graduated from 
        school and left town, we changed the name of the band to the &quot;Strung-out 
        String Band&quot; and got my brother to play banjo with us. Rusty followed 
        his academic and musical Muse to a life in other places for fifteen or 
        twenty years before he returned to Columbia to settle in for the long 
        haul. It seemed only natural to get him to add his Missouri style fiddling 
        to &quot;Mondolina&quot;.</font></p>

      Jim and Lee to determine which song they were going to record, the next 
      step was finding a good time to get them into the studio. We started with 
      a setup in the studio that had them spread a good distance apart and baffled 
      to isolate the instruments. We quickly determined that was not going to 
      work. They just never play that way together. So we gathered Jim, Lee, and 
      Howard in chairs all around one microphone and let them have at it. After 
      a few practice run throughs to make sure we had it all, we rolled tape on 
      this sweet instrumental.</font></td>
