<p>GAYLOR WAIVES ARRAIGNMENT ON CHILD ABUSE CHARGES</p>
<p>A Poplar Bluff man who was arrested earlier this week after a child suffered multiple injuries appeared in court yesterday.</p>
<p>According to Missouri Case net, 27 year old Damien Gaylor is facing six counts of abuse or neglect of a child. One of the counts stems from the arrest earlier this week, while the other five were from incidents that allegedly occurred in 2017.</p>
<p>According to Poplar Bluff Police, earlier this week Gaylor admitted to throwing a six year old child, causing her to land on the corner of a couch and pushing her down, causing her to strike her head against a stove.</p>
<p>The child was treated for a brain bleed, collapsed lung, broken ribs, and bruising all over her body.</p>
<p>Gaylor appeared before Judge John Bloodworth on Thursday. He waived arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty.</p>
<p>Gaylor is scheduled to appear in court again on January 18th for a counsel status hearing.</p>

<p>AREA RESIDENTS WARNED TO STAY OFF OF FROZEN PONDS OR BODIES OF WATER</p>
<p>A local Police director is reminding area residents about the dangers of frozen ponds and bodies of water.</p>
<p>Sikeston Department of Public Safety Director Mike Williams tells KWOC News he is urging people to stay safe by staying off frozen city ponds or bodies of water.</p>
<p>Williams says that most ponds or lakes have a shelving slope before they drop off into deeper water and it is extremely dangerous if people venture on to the ice not knowing how deep the water is below them and particularly how thick or, in most cases, how thin the ice is they are standing on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tips for what to do if you see someone fall through the ice or if you yourself fall through ice:</p>
<p>•Shout for assistance and send for the emergency services by calling 911.</p>
<p>•Stay off the ice</p>
<p>•Shout to the person to keep still and not to panic</p>
<p>•Try and reach them from the bank using a rope, pole, a tree branch, clothing tied together or anything else that extends your reach</p>
<p>•When reaching for the bank, lie down to avoid being pulled onto the ice</p>
<p>•If you cannot reach them, slide something that floats like a rescue buoy across the ice for them to hold on to stay afloat</p>
<p>•If the casualty is out of reach, wait for the emergency services while calming and reassuring them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the victim has been rescued from the ice:</p>
<p>•Make sure the ambulance is on its way and that you have called 911because hypothermia can set in quickly.</p>
<p>•Lay them flat, check their breathing and pulse and begin resuscitation if necessary</p>
<p>•Prevent them from getting colder by putting them in a sleeping bag or covering them including their head, with blankets or spare clothing</p>
<p>•Get them under shelter out of the cold</p>
<p>•Until the casualty is in a warm place do not undress them</p>
<p>•Do not rub their skin or apply hot water</p>
<p>•Keep them wrapped up so that they warm up gradually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you fall through the ice:</p>
<p>•Keep calm and call for help</p>
<p>•If no help is available spread your arms across the surface of the ice</p>
<p>•If the ice is strong enough kick your legs and slide onto the ice</p>
<p>•Lie flat and pull yourself to the bank</p>
<p>•If the ice is very thin, break it in front of you and make your way to the shore</p>
<p>•If you cannot climb out, wait for help keeping as still as possible</p>
<p>•Press your arms by your side and keep your legs together</p>
<p>•Once you are safe, go to hospital immediately for a checkup.</p>
