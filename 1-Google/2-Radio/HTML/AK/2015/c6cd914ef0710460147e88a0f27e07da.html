The\nopinions expressed are my own. I&#8217;d like to thank KTNA Radio for the\nopportunity to share my composition with their listeners.\nBefore beginning the:\nJourney to the Forbidden Isle,\nI&#8217;d like to start with an excerpt from John F. Kennedy&#8217;s Commencement\nspeech at the American University in Washington D.C. in 1963.\n&#8220;So, let us not be blind to our differences \u2013 but let us also direct attention to\nour common interests and the means by which those differences can be\nresolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help\nmake the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic\ncommon link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the\nsame air. We all cherish our children\u2019s futures. And we are all mortal.&#8221;\nWhat crystallized my decision to visit Cuba was when President Obama\nstated that &#8220;the Cold War was over&#8221;. Having grown up in Washington D.C.,\nat the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, my fellow classmates were\ninstructed to duck below the desks during an attack, for all the good that\nwould have done. Those recollections joined with a late developing\ninterest in the political science of the of the Kennedy assassination. As\nmy study deepened, it became obvious to me that Cuba had been a pivot\npoint in the most important political events of the last century. Hypnotically,\nmy attention became focused on a journey to a once Forbidden Isle.\nCuba&#8230;..when a topic is suppressed in public discourse, the growing\nawareness of one&#8217;s ignorance is profound. Modern Cuba and Cubans are\nthe product of a maelstrom in a cauldron.\nBegin with Columbus&#8217; unintended discovery in 1492. Add Spanish\ncolonialism , European conflicts, Pirates &amp; Corsairs, French sugar and\ncoffee plantations, African slavery, civil wars, and a war of independence.\nCount to 1898. Stir in the Rough Riders, the Platt Act, and Batista . Bring to\na boil with Castro, Che, and the Revolution. Mix in the Mafia, the CIA, the\nBay of Pigs, the Missile Crisis, and the Kennedy assassination. Let cool,\nand top off with Guantanamo and a 50 year embargo. Add a dash of\nHemingway &amp; Greene, and spice with the Buena Vista Social Club. Cuba,\nwhat was it? Cubans, who were they?\nMy objectives were: 1) to view the Malecon, the roadway along Havana&#8217;s\nwaterfront minus mobster Meyer Lansky&#8217;s dream of endless casinos 2) to\nview of the Bay of Pigs from the perspective of Cuba, 3) to see Valles de\nlos Ingenios (the Valley of the Sugar Mills) in order to try to understand\nbetter the economics and the society of Cuba, 4) to view Gitmo from the\nsoil of Cuba and, 5) to meet with and to interact with Cubans in order to try\nto get an insight into their thoughts about the easing of relations with the\nUSA.\nThe Treasury department responded to my email: &#8220;In a few words, we\ncannot comment on what the requirements will be until the requirements\nactually change.&#8221; Restoration of diplomatic ties is on the table as this is\nwritten. Unrestricted travel to Cuba for US citizens is still not yet\nauthorized, but there are avenues. Journalism is one of them.\nAlthough only 90 air miles from the the mainland, sometimes, the direct\napproach is not always the easiest. Arranging payment for flights, for\ndeparture fees, for a tourist visa, for travel insurance, for planned activities\nin Cuba required an agent. Money was an issue as US bank affiliated Visa\nand Master Cards transactions would not be recognized. No ATM, meant\ncarrying $1200 cash, mostly Canadian to avoid a 13% exchange fee. My\ntotal budget added up to about $3500. At that point my biggest concerns\nwere negotiating the international connection at Cancun smoothly and\nmeeting the ground transfer to my home-stay in Havana. My gear barely fit\ninto one carry on. Later, I wished I had packed some postcards of Obama\nand more baseball caps.\nWhy would anyone visit LA, Miami, or New Orleans when one could visit\nHavana, the Casablanca of the Western Hemisphere? At one end of the\ncity lay the apparently upscale Miramar neighborhood with roller bladers,\nbicyclists, pedestrians, and joggers. All that was missing were the soccer\nmoms. The Russian Embassy, loomed over the diplomatic missions of\nother countries and looked like a tower ready to launch a Soyuz rocket\nWhere would the USA locate its State Department representative? No one\nknew.\nEntering the Vedado district there was a mix of colonial, Art Deco\nrepublican, and modern architecture in various states of disrepair,\nrenovation, remodeling, and construction. Bicitaxis began to appear as did\nstreams of classic cars, some belching smoke, some lunging with slipping\nclutches. On occasion there was a horse drawn carriage. People were\nwalking or waiting for a bus. None had a cell phone attached to their ear.\nAt the end of El Rampa was the tall Havana Libre, once a Hilton Hotel with\na casino, once headquarters for Castro in 1959. A few blocks away, stood\nthe stately Hotel Nacional, where the mafia met to discuss Havana&#8217;s future.\nFrom an adjacent apartment building, the roof top bar gave a bird&#8217;s eye\nview of the city. Distinctly visible from that perch , at the head of the\nRevolutionary Plaza ,stood the obelisk, dedicated to Jose Marti, the guiding\nspirit of Cuba&#8217;s universal education system. Not visible, inside the\ngovernment buildings, were those who held the levers of power. How and\nwhy they make their decisions could not be known, but all the world would\nbe watching now. Towards Old Havana, the dome of the Capitol building\nrose among a mix of other structures.\nThe official tree of Cuba is the royal palm,some say it was imported from\nFlorida. The banyan tree with a multitude of interlaced roots , like the ones\nthat gird the Avenue of Presidents would serve as well. Modern Cuba and\nCubans are the product of five continents and five centuries. Driving along\nthe Malceon, were there were no billboards. or advertising signs. Nor did\nthe skyline along the waterfront look like the Riviera or Las Vegas. For a\ncity of two million there was not much traffic. Walking along Calle Obispo In\nOld Havana, one could begin to hear, feel, smell, taste, and see an exotic\nalmagamation at its most intense. The architecture was amazing. The\nfundamental rhythm was: uno,dos, tres. It is as though one could magically\nwalk between centuries as one traveled from square to square, along\nnarrow streets, and between avenues guarded by tall buildings. The tourist\ncenter had its jinteros and jintereras, its touts and its hustlers, but overall\nHavana was warm, earthy, and gritty. Later, only Santiago seemed to have\na hard edge to it.\nAt Parque Central a torrential rain storm held myself and a hundred others\nhostage as the streets flooded. The proximity of the lighting flashes and of\nthe cracks of thunder made us all tremble nervously in unison at the power\nof the tropical storm. Back at the home-stay, before leaving , Berta, the\nowner, asked me: &#8221; Tell your friends that Cubans are good people.&#8221; Her\nhospitality and excellent breakfasts were to be repeated across the island.\nMy two day instruction in Spanish had been a total immersion into history,\ngeography, religion, and philosophy. Pilar taught by enthusiastically\ncombining written and spoken words with music, song, and dance.\nChildlike communication was enabled in all subjects. Pilar showed me her\nworld: pictures of her children, the garden visible from her apartment, her\nneighbors passing by on the street. She commented: &#8220;Community and\nfamily were what Cubans cherished.&#8221; But she added: &#8221; Every Cuban\ndreamed of travel.&#8221; Pilar and myself parted in agreement that a balance\nbetween the material and the spiritual was best. She said: &#8220;The past\ndoesn&#8217;t exist, nor the future, there is only the moment&#8221;. In a large city, it\nseemed like each street was a village unto itself. Later, a young woman\nfrom Malaysia shared an impression: &#8220;Cubans are lacking in things, but\nthey have a lot of dignity.&#8221;\nThis concludes part one of &#8220;Journey to the Forbidden Isle&#8221; I&#8217;d like to thank\nKTNA for allowing me to share this with their listeners.\nJourney to the Forbidden Isle, by Tony Martin\n&nbsp;","articleBody":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Cuba22.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-36115\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Cuba22-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Cuba22\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>When it became possible for citizens of this country to travel to Cuba,<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Talkeetna resident Tony Martin wasted no time getting there.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He wanted to share his experience, and knowledge gained, with others.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here&#8217;s the first of three parts of his story:<\/p>\n<p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-52811-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Tony-Martin-JourneyIsle1-6-7-15.mp3?_=2\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Tony-Martin-JourneyIsle1-6-7-15.mp3\">https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/Tony-Martin-JourneyIsle1-6-7-15.mp3<\/a><\/audio><\/p>\n<p>I recently had the opportunity to visit Cuba.<br \/>\nI wrote down my impressions in a short piece, which I have titled: &#8220;A<br \/>\nJourney to the Forbidden Isle.&#8221; Hopefully, this travelogue will provide an<br \/>\ninsight into the history, politics, economics, and the people of an incredibly<br \/>\ndiverse and complicated country.\u00a0 (Photos and text follow).<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>I will be breaking this story into three<br \/>\nsegments, which more or less, follow my itinerary across Cuba.

A few blocks away, stood<br \/>\nthe stately Hotel Nacional, where the mafia met to discuss Havana&#8217;s future.<br \/>\nFrom an adjacent apartment building, the roof top bar gave a bird&#8217;s eye<br \/>\nview of the city. Distinctly visible from that perch , at the head of the<br \/>\nRevolutionary Plaza ,stood the obelisk, dedicated to Jose Marti, the guiding<br \/>\nspirit of Cuba&#8217;s universal education system. Not visible, inside the<br \/>\ngovernment buildings, were those who held the levers of power. How and<br \/>\nwhy they make their decisions could not be known, but all the world would<br \/>\nbe watching now. Towards Old Havana, the dome of the Capitol building<br \/>\nrose among a mix of other structures.<br \/>\nThe official tree of Cuba is the royal palm,some say it was imported from<br \/>\nFlorida. The banyan tree with a multitude of interlaced roots , like the ones<br \/>\nthat gird the Avenue of Presidents would serve as well. Modern Cuba and<br \/>\nCubans are the product of five continents and five centuries. Driving along<br \/>\nthe Malceon, were there were no billboards. or advertising signs. Nor did<br \/>\nthe skyline along the waterfront look like the Riviera or Las Vegas. For a<br \/>\ncity of two million there was not much traffic. Walking along Calle Obispo In<br \/>\nOld Havana, one could begin to hear, feel, smell, taste, and see an exotic<br \/>\nalmagamation at its most intense. The architecture was amazing. The<br \/>\nfundamental rhythm was: uno,dos, tres. It is as though one could magically<br \/>\nwalk between centuries as one traveled from square to square, along<br \/>\nnarrow streets, and between avenues guarded by tall buildings. The tourist<br \/>\ncenter had its jinteros and jintereras, its touts and its hustlers, but overall<br \/>\nHavana was warm, earthy, and gritty. Later, only Santiago seemed to have<br \/>\na hard edge to it.<br \/>\nAt Parque Central a torrential rain storm held myself and a hundred others<br \/>\nhostage as the streets flooded. The proximity of the lighting flashes and of<br \/>\nthe cracks of thunder made us all tremble nervously in unison at the power<br \/>\nof the tropical storm. Back at the home-stay, before leaving , Berta, the<br \/>\nowner, asked me: &#8221; Tell your friends that Cubans are good people.&#8221; Her<br \/>\nhospitality and excellent breakfasts were to be repeated across the island.<br \/>\nMy two day instruction in Spanish had been a total immersion into history,<br \/>\ngeography, religion, and philosophy. Pilar taught by enthusiastically<br \/>\ncombining written and spoken words with music, song, and dance.<br \/>\nChildlike communication was enabled in all subjects. Pilar showed me her<br \/>\nworld: pictures of her children, the garden visible from her apartment, her<br \/>\nneighbors passing by on the street. She commented: &#8220;Community and<br \/>\nfamily were what Cubans cherished.&#8221; But she added: &#8221; Every Cuban<br \/>\ndreamed of travel.&#8221; Pilar and myself parted in agreement that a balance<br \/>\nbetween the material and the spiritual was best. She said: &#8220;The past<br \/>\ndoesn&#8217;t exist, nor the future, there is only the moment&#8221;. In a large city, it<br \/>\nseemed like each street was a village unto itself. Later, a young woman<br \/>\nfrom Malaysia shared an impression: &#8220;Cubans are lacking in things, but<br \/>\nthey have a lot of dignity.&#8221;<br \/>\nThis concludes part one of &#8220;Journey to the Forbidden Isle&#8221; I&#8217;d like to thank<br \/>\nKTNA for allowing me to share this with their listeners.<\/p>\n<p>Journey to the Forbidden Isle, by Tony Martin<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","articleSection":["Susitna Writer's Voice"],"wordCount":1501},{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Article","@id":"https:\/\/ktna.org\/Schema\/Article\/52812","description":"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the preliminary report on a midair collision at the Talkeetna Airport on May 31st.

received an update on the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas Project at its monthly board meeting.\u00a0 Area residents learned a few new details about the plans for the gas pipeline and were able to ask questions regarding its route.\u00a0 KTNA\u2019s Phillip Manning was there, and has this report:\nhttps:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/20150603AKLNG.mp3\nA stop at the Talkeetna Community Council meeting was not on the original schedule for the AK LNG staff.\u00a0 Two open houses were scheduled for Sunshine and Trapper Creek, but the timing of the council meeting meant that Michael Nelson, Socioeconomic Lead for the project, was able to attend.\u00a0 Nelson says that the preferred route for AK LNG would travel through the Upper Valley west of the Susitna River, through the Trapper Creek area, on its way to Nikiski.\u00a0 Once in Nikiski, the plan calls for the gas to be liquefied and exported.\u00a0 Assembly Member Vern Halter was present at the meeting, and asked whether the project\u2019s partners, which consist of BP, Conoco-Philips, Exxon-Mobil, and the State of Alaska, are set on using Nikiski as the final destination for the pipeline.\nHalter: \u201cSo, you\u2019re sold on Nikiski.\u00a0 There\u2019s no changing Nikiski with you guys.\u201d\nNelson: \u201cIt\u2019s the preferred location, there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\nWhen Halter and some locals questioned the choice of Nikiski, Nelson responded that there were multiple factors that went into the decision, and that they did not include the fact that Nikiski is the home district of Representative Mike Chenault, current Speaker of the State House of Representatives.\n\u201cEvery site has pros and cons, but when you take all the factors together and look at them together, Nikiski was the preferred site.\u201d\nThe Mat-Su Borough Assembly has advocated for the potential use of Port MacKenzie for export of liquid natural gas.\u00a0 While that could still happen, it would involve creating a connection from the main pipeline to the Mat-Su port.\u00a0 Five such \u2018off-takes\u2019 will be built as part of the agreement between the state and oil companies, but where they will be has yet to be determined.\nSome local residents had specific questions and concerns about the pipeline\u2019s route, access to gas for Alaskans, and other issues.\u00a0 Talkeetna resident Ruth Wood says it\u2019s important that AK LNG makes those questions part of the planning process.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, in every single community this is going to go through, wants the answers to those questions, and I want to make sure we get the answers before the route is permanent.\u201d\nMichael Nelson says that the concerns of people who live along the entire length of the proposed pipeline are being considered, and that the plan is still being formulated.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that everything was decided five years ago, and we\u2019re just\u2014you know\u2014just doing what we want to do. We\u2019re serious about getting the feedback and using the best we can.\u201d\nRight now, AK LNG is in the Pre-front-end engineering and design, or Pre-FEED phase.\u00a0 It has also begun the process of filing for a permit to build the project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\u00a0 More meetings in the Upper Valley are likely as part of the permitting process in coming years.","articleBody":"<p>Earlier this week, the Talkeetna Community Council received an update on the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas Project at its monthly board meeting.\u00a0 Area residents learned a few new details about the plans for the gas pipeline and were able to ask questions regarding its route.\u00a0 KTNA\u2019s Phillip Manning was there, and has this report:<\/p>\n<p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-52811-11\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/20150603AKLNG.mp3?_=11\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/20150603AKLNG.mp3\">https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/20150603AKLNG.mp3<\/a><\/audio><\/p>\n<p>A stop at the Talkeetna Community Council meeting was not on the original schedule for the AK LNG staff.\u00a0 Two open houses were scheduled for Sunshine and Trapper Creek, but the timing of the council meeting meant that Michael Nelson, Socioeconomic Lead for the project, was able to attend.\u00a0 Nelson says that the preferred route for AK LNG would travel through the Upper Valley west of the Susitna River, through the Trapper Creek area, on its way to Nikiski.\u00a0 Once in Nikiski, the plan calls for the gas to be liquefied and exported.\u00a0 Assembly Member Vern Halter was present at the meeting, and asked whether the project\u2019s partners, which consist of BP, Conoco-Philips, Exxon-Mobil, and the State of Alaska, are set on using Nikiski as the final destination for the pipeline.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Halter: \u201cSo, you\u2019re sold on Nikiski.\u00a0 There\u2019s no changing Nikiski with you guys.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nelson: \u201cIt\u2019s the preferred location, there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Halter and some locals questioned the choice of Nikiski, Nelson responded that there were multiple factors that went into the decision, and that they did not include the fact that Nikiski is the home district of Representative Mike Chenault, current Speaker of the State House of Representatives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery site has pros and cons, but when you take all the factors together and look at them together, Nikiski was the preferred site.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Mat-Su Borough Assembly has advocated for the potential use of Port MacKenzie for export of liquid natural gas.\u00a0 While that could still happen, it would involve creating a connection from the main pipeline to the Mat-Su port.\u00a0 Five such \u2018off-takes\u2019 will be built as part of the agreement between the state and oil companies, but where they will be has yet to be determined.<\/p>\n<p>Some local residents had specific questions and concerns about the pipeline\u2019s route, access to gas for Alaskans, and other issues.\u00a0 Talkeetna resident Ruth Wood says it\u2019s important that AK LNG makes those questions part of the planning process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, in every single community this is going to go through, wants the answers to those questions, and I want to make sure we get the answers before the route is permanent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Michael Nelson says that the concerns of people who live along the entire length of the proposed pipeline are being considered, and that the plan is still being formulated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think that everything was decided five years ago, and we\u2019re just\u2014you know\u2014just doing what we want to do.
