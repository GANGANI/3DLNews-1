He was surrounded by family.\n\n\n\nOrville was born at the home of his paternal grandparents on July 23, 1938, in Stanton, North Dakota, to Herbert Grosz and Esther Leontina Grosz (n\u00e9e Kruckenberg). His youngest sister Bonnie liked to tease him about being born in a barn. He was the oldest of four siblings\u2013including a brother, Duane John, who only survived nine months, and two sisters, Betty and Bonnie. His first few years were spent on a farm along the Missouri River where his father worked for a dollar a day. The Grosz family was part of a small community of Black Sea German immigrants, so that was the language spoken at home for the first 10 years of his life. This made Orville\u2019s first language German, and although he didn\u2019t retain an accent and had lost most of his German by the time he was in his 50s, he didn\u2019t learn English until he went to kindergarten at the age of five.\n\n\n\nBoth of his parents worked, so Orville learned to cook at an early age. Before heading out to her job as a house painter, his mother would write out instructions and recipes for him to feed his younger sisters. He was an excellent cook, and even taught his mother to make pizza in later years.\n\n\n\nIn 1947, when Orville was 9, the family home was acquired for the Garrison Dam project, and thousands of people were relocated to the surrounding area. The Grosz family moved to Pick City, a small town built to relocate people unhomed by what would become the new reservoir, Lake Sakakawea.\n\n\n\nFrom the ages of 12 to 18, Orville worked on a farm in the summer and came home on the weekends. In his free time, he ran wild hunting and fishing along the abandoned Missouri River Basin until the Garrison Dam was finished when he was 15. After that, he ran wild around the edges of the lake. He taught his sisters how to fish\u2013his sister Betty remembers him helping her reel in a 12 lb catfish. She also remembers that he would only take her fishing if she baited her own hook. He loved reading from an early age, and if he wasn\u2019t hunting or fishing, he had his nose in a book. He also started his lifelong affair with woodworking during this time, building a set of shelves for knick-knacks in school that was used in the home.\n\n\n\nAfter high school, Orville attended some college but couldn\u2019t afford to finish. He joined the Army and was stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall went up. He never saw combat, but in later years he would sometimes talk about the tension as the wall was built, recalling standing guard all night with the snow coming down, staring across the slowly growing concrete barrier at some teenager on the other side and hoping nobody got an itchy trigger finger.\n\n\n\nWhile he was in the service, after writing him several letters, his sister Betty pestered him about not writing, saying that she would be happy with just a simple \u201chi.\u201d Three weeks later, she received a single page with just the word \u201cHI\u201d scribbled in giant letters.\n\n\n\nAfter returning home, he briefly worked a road construction job on I-94 before finding long-term employment with the Basin Electric Power Cooperative. He worked for Basin Electric for 29 years before taking an early retirement at the age of 57. Somewhere in there, he also found time to work as a volunteer firefighter for a number of years.\n\n\n\nHis nephews have fond memories of visiting during summers in the 1970s and 80s. He read wildlife field guides with them, retelling true stories of rare birds he had seen or types of fish he had caught. Unlike with his little sister, he would patiently bait their hooks when he took them out fishing.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 1984, Orville\u2019s youngest sister Bonnie, her first husband Tom, and their two kids were living in Alaska when Orville, Betty, and Bonnie\u2019s father got sick. Tom was waiting to start a job and didn\u2019t want Bonnie driving the Alcan alone, so her friend Patricia (Paddy) Callahan agreed to share the drive. They piled into a car with Bonnie\u2019s two kids and Paddy\u2019s daughter, Shannon, and drove to North Dakota, fulfilling a forgotten promise Bonnie had laughingly made to Orville long before, that she would bring a girl home and they would get married.\n\n\n\nOrville and Paddy were married in August 1985, and in May 1986 they welcomed their daughter, Willow. Shortly thereafter Orville adopted Shannon.\n\n\n\nAfter retiring from Basin Electric in 1995, Orville moved with Paddy, Shannon, and Willow to Talkeetna, Alaska, to build a house in the woods. Orville and Paddy quickly became involved in the community, regularly donating to KTNA, attending concerts at the Latitude 62 and throughout the community, volunteering for the Upper Susitna Senior Center, and trying to find the best cup of plain black coffee in town.\n\n\n\nAs often happens in retirement, there was a long list of things to do, so he didn\u2019t get out hunting and fishing as much as he would have liked. However, every Father\u2019s Day, he went fishing for landlocked silvers at Christiansen Lake with Willow, who remembers baiting her own hook, but not whether it was a requirement.\n\n\n\nAfter their youngest child left for college, Orville took a winter job with the Mat-Su Borough transfer stations and a summer job at the Talkeetna Depot for the Alaska Railroad. He worked for the Mat-Su Borough for 17 years before retiring in 2023. He worked for the Alaska Railroad for 18 years. Although he was planning on it, he never did manage to fully retire. A week after he passed away, he was still scheduled for the annual Railroad refresher training for the 2024 tourist season.\n\n\n\nHe was a talented and avid gardener, often successfully growing vegetables and flowers that have no business surviving in Alaska.

He was surrounded by family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orville was born at the home of his paternal grandparents on July 23, 1938, in Stanton, North Dakota, to Herbert Grosz and Esther Leontina Grosz (n\u00e9e Kruckenberg). His youngest sister Bonnie liked to tease him about being born in a barn. He was the oldest of four siblings\u2013including a brother, Duane John, who only survived nine months, and two sisters, Betty and Bonnie. His first few years were spent on a farm along the Missouri River where his father worked for a dollar a day. The Grosz family was part of a small community of Black Sea German immigrants, so that was the language spoken at home for the first 10 years of his life. This made Orville\u2019s first language German, and although he didn\u2019t retain an accent and had lost most of his German by the time he was in his 50s, he didn\u2019t learn English until he went to kindergarten at the age of five.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of his parents worked, so Orville learned to cook at an early age. Before heading out to her job as a house painter, his mother would write out instructions and recipes for him to feed his younger sisters. He was an excellent cook, and even taught his mother to make pizza in later years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1947, when Orville was 9, the family home was acquired for the Garrison Dam project, and thousands of people were relocated to the surrounding area. The Grosz family moved to Pick City, a small town built to relocate people unhomed by what would become the new reservoir, Lake Sakakawea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the ages of 12 to 18, Orville worked on a farm in the summer and came home on the weekends. In his free time, he ran wild hunting and fishing along the abandoned Missouri River Basin until the Garrison Dam was finished when he was 15. After that, he ran wild around the edges of the lake. He taught his sisters how to fish\u2013his sister Betty remembers him helping her reel in a 12 lb catfish. She also remembers that he would only take her fishing if she baited her own hook. He loved reading from an early age, and if he wasn\u2019t hunting or fishing, he had his nose in a book. He also started his lifelong affair with woodworking during this time, building a set of shelves for knick-knacks in school that was used in the home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Orville attended some college but couldn\u2019t afford to finish. He joined the Army and was stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall went up. He never saw combat, but in later years he would sometimes talk about the tension as the wall was built, recalling standing guard all night with the snow coming down, staring across the slowly growing concrete barrier at some teenager on the other side and hoping nobody got an itchy trigger finger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While he was in the service, after writing him several letters, his sister Betty pestered him about not writing, saying that she would be happy with just a simple \u201chi.\u201d Three weeks later, she received a single page with just the word \u201cHI\u201d scribbled in giant letters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After returning home, he briefly worked a road construction job on I-94 before finding long-term employment with the Basin Electric Power Cooperative. He worked for Basin Electric for 29 years before taking an early retirement at the age of 57. Somewhere in there, he also found time to work as a volunteer firefighter for a number of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His nephews have fond memories of visiting during summers in the 1970s and 80s. He read wildlife field guides with them, retelling true stories of rare birds he had seen or types of fish he had caught. Unlike with his little sister, he would patiently bait their hooks when he took them out fishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 1984, Orville\u2019s youngest sister Bonnie, her first husband Tom, and their two kids were living in Alaska when Orville, Betty, and Bonnie\u2019s father got sick. Tom was waiting to start a job and didn\u2019t want Bonnie driving the Alcan alone, so her friend Patricia (Paddy) Callahan agreed to share the drive. They piled into a car with Bonnie\u2019s two kids and Paddy\u2019s daughter, Shannon, and drove to North Dakota, fulfilling a forgotten promise Bonnie had laughingly made to Orville long before, that she would bring a girl home and they would get married.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orville and Paddy were married in August 1985, and in May 1986 they welcomed their daughter, Willow. Shortly thereafter Orville adopted Shannon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After retiring from Basin Electric in 1995, Orville moved with Paddy, Shannon, and Willow to Talkeetna, Alaska, to build a house in the woods. Orville and Paddy quickly became involved in the community, regularly donating to KTNA, attending concerts at the Latitude 62 and throughout the community, volunteering for the Upper Susitna Senior Center, and trying to find the best cup of plain black coffee in town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As often happens in retirement, there was a long list of things to do, so he didn\u2019t get out hunting and fishing as much as he would have liked. However, every Father\u2019s Day, he went fishing for landlocked silvers at Christiansen Lake with Willow, who remembers baiting her own hook, but not whether it was a requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After their youngest child left for college, Orville took a winter job with the Mat-Su Borough transfer stations and a summer job at the Talkeetna Depot for the Alaska Railroad. He worked for the Mat-Su Borough for 17 years before retiring in 2023. He worked for the Alaska Railroad for 18 years. Although he was planning on it, he never did manage to fully retire. A week after he passed away, he was still scheduled for the annual Railroad refresher training for the 2024 tourist season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was a talented and avid gardener, often successfully growing vegetables and flowers that have no business surviving in Alaska. He taught woodworking for the Community Schools program, and later, when he started keeping bees, he shared his apiary knowledge as well. He bottled honey, made his own mead, and loved canning and putting up food for the winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orville was preceded in death by his parents, infant brother Duane John, and his wife of 29 years, Paddy. He is survived by his sisters Betty (Jerry) Brekhus and Bonnie (Kenneth) Tritle; daughters Willow Grosz and Shannon Thornton; and grandsons Steven, Michael, and Brandon Thornton, as well as four nieces and nephews, a number of grandnieces and grandnephews, many assorted cousins, and his beloved cat Artemis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orville will be remembered for his warm smile coupled with his endless patience and preference to do things right the first time; his love of nature, reading, good coffee, and oatmeal stout; and his dry, gentle, and straight-faced sense of humor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A formal celebration of life will be held in Talkeetna, Alaska, in the summer of 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the Grosz family would like to invite the community to join in informally raising a glass to Orville at the Latitude 62 on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 6 pm Talkeetna time.

Born to Dr. Arthur and Mary Lou Mannix, he was the oldest son of eleven children. His young life included camping, alpine skiing, and sailing on Long Island Sound in a small boat he shared with a pet raccoon he rescued.\n\n\n\nArthur majored in zoology at the University of New Hampshire. During college, he lived in a handsewn dome tent he set up on the land of Evelyn Browne, daughter of famed artist and Alaska explorer Belmore Browne. With his brother and friends, he hiked 1,000 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail, attempting Mt. Rainier and climbing in Yosemite. After completing college, Arthur hitchhiked out west to climb.\n\n\n\nHe arrived in Alaska in 1978, where he made the first ascent of Grendel Spire in the Cathedral Spires with his brother and a friend and put his climbing skills to use in the logging industry. Arthur summited Denali multiple times as a guide; climbed the west face of Kahiltna Queen; and made the first winter ascent of Mt. Sanford, sleeping in snow caves and eating wild game.\n\n\n\nHe met his wife, Karen, in Wrangell, and they eventually settled in Talkeetna. In 1981, Arthur lead a rescue of plane crash victims on the Peters Glacier during a December blizzard. In January, he and Karen salvaged the plane with two companions and skied from 10,000\u2019 on Denali to Talkeetna.\n\n\n\nArthur and his brother started Top Notch Logbuilders. Their quality craftsmanship can be seen throughout Alaska and includes the renovation of Don Sheldon\u2019s airplane hangar (now the Sheldon Community Arts Hangar) in Talkeetna and an addition on Jay and Bella Hammond&#8217;s Lake Clark home.\n\n\n\nArthur and Karen raised two wonderful children, Tazlina and Ian, in their off-grid home. The family hiked, rafted, skied, and cycled on many adventures, from the Arctic to Prince William Sound. He and Karen introduced hundreds of people to cross-country skiing through the Denali Nordic Ski Club and created a junior Nordic program for local youth. Arthur and his brother brought the Oosik Classic Ski Race to Talkeetna and worked tirelessly to create a widely used community trail system.\n\n\n\nArthur read extensively about history, anthropology, geology, and biology and was an outspoken defender of wilderness. He authored marvelous essays and was an enthusiastic storyteller, a devoted father and husband, and a genuine friend. Arthur is survived by his wife, daughter, son, ten siblings and their spouses, a large extended family, and friends the world over. A celebration of life will be held in Talkeetna on September 15. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Arthur Mannix Memorial Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo hear any of Arthur&#8217;s contributions to KTNA, search in your browser using this link: https:\/\/ktna.org\/?s=arthur+mannix","articleBody":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-87877\" width=\"327\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-800x800.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-200x200.jpg 200w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Arthur-Mannix-photo-color-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arthur Mannix died at home in Talkeetna, Alaska, on July 2, 2023.

He had one older sister, Carol, and many many cousins.\n\n\n\nOne of approximately 900 men named Louis in a large Italian family, he started going by Kenny at a young age. During childhood, he was occasionally known as Ken Farinawitz in order to evade the truant officers when skipping school with his Jewish friends.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating high school Ken worked photo typesetter for a commercial arts company in Manhattan. Ken moved to Talkeetna in 1976, following several close friends from New York. During his first year in Alaska, he lived with Johnny Rowland in a Visqueen tent, surviving on beans, rice, moose, pasta, and beer.\n\n\n\nDuring his early years in Talkeetna, Ken was a farmhand on Lichtenwalner Farm, a bartender at the Fairview, and the town milkman. In 1979 he started working on the North Slope for VECO (later CH2M Hill). He also spent a year working for Irby, installing the industrial power lines that now run from Anchorage to Fairbanks. In either 1976 or \u201877 (no one is quite sure), he started serving Talkeetna as a volunteer with the fire department.\n\n\n\nOn a cold winter night in January 1980, Ken and several other men gathered at the Fairview to discuss the shallow dating pool in Talkeetna. One mentioned the Bachelor Societies of England, and the Talkeetna Bachelor Society and Bachelor Ball were created. At the first Bachelor Auction in 1981, Ken was auctioned off for [redacted] to [redacted].\n\n\n\nIn 1983 he met Mary Baar when she hit his truck in front of the Fairview. Mary tracked Ken down to apologize, he told her that she had nice elbows, and the rest is history.\n\n\n\nIn 1984 Ken and Mary were married in a wedding that looked like it was from 1976, since the 70s came to Talkeetna ten years late. One of the conditions Mary had for marrying Ken was that he install an actual front door on his cabin (instead of the piece of carpet that was covering the doorway).\n\n\n\nIn 1986 Ken and Mary welcomed their oldest child, Ann, followed by their second child, Matthew in 1989. After his children flew the coop Ken (and Mary) replaced them with a series of increasingly insane Spaniels.\n\n\n\nKen played catcher with the Mandingos for many years, until June 1987 when he suffered a career-ending injury sliding into 3rd base.\n\n\n\nKen continued to serve with the fire department. He was promoted to fire chief in 1994 and later to district chief. He retired from the fire department on April 1, 2015, after 35+ years of service. He retired from CH2M Hill in January 2016. Upon retirement, he promptly returned to his 1970s self and smoked the largest blunt he could find.\n\n\n\nIn retirement Ken found fulfillment in spending time with Mary, tending to his garden, trying to outsmart the moose who kept eating his garden, playing poker, drinking coffee with friends, and going on \u201cboy&#8217;s trips\u201d to Vegas.\n\n\n\nKen is survived by his wife of 38 years, Mary Farina of Talkeetna, AK; his offspring, Ann Farina of Washington and Matt Farina (Carolyn) of Alaska; as well as many nieces, nephews, cousins, friends, and drinking\/smoking\/poker buddies.\n\n\n\nKen was preceded in death by his parents, sister Carol Farina, and at least a couple of people he beat at poker.\n\n\n\nA celebration of life\/ice cream social will be held at the Talkeetna Fire Hall in Talkeetna, AK in July 2023.\n\n\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Ken\u2019s name to the Talkeetna Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe Farina family would like to extend their gratitude to the Sunshine Community Health Clinic (especially Layla, Ryan, and Janelle), the staff of Mat-Su Wound Care, the staff of Midnight Sun Oncology, and the nurses, doctors, and other care providers who cared for Ken in the last week of his life.","articleBody":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/307837960_10225185967987741_4237741843915473984_n-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82217\" width=\"663\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/307837960_10225185967987741_4237741843915473984_n-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/307837960_10225185967987741_4237741843915473984_n-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/307837960_10225185967987741_4237741843915473984_n-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/307837960_10225185967987741_4237741843915473984_n.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" \/><figcaption>Kenny Farina<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Longtime Talkeetna resident\/troublemaker, best friend, beloved father, and husband Louis Kenneth \u201cKenny\u201d Farina, 71, passed away peacefully on September 17th, 2022 while receiving hospice for cancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken was born on January 22, 1951, in Queens, New York to Carmela Farina (n\u00e9e Carbonaro), and Louis Farina.

In either 1976 or \u201877 (no one is quite sure), he started serving Talkeetna as a volunteer with the fire department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a cold winter night in January 1980, Ken and several other men gathered at the Fairview to discuss the shallow dating pool in Talkeetna. One mentioned the Bachelor Societies of England, and the Talkeetna Bachelor Society and Bachelor Ball were created. At the first Bachelor Auction in 1981, Ken was auctioned off for [redacted] to [redacted].<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1983 he met Mary Baar when she hit his truck in front of the Fairview. Mary tracked Ken down to apologize, he told her that she had nice elbows, and the rest is history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1984 Ken and Mary were married in a wedding that looked like it was from 1976, since the 70s came to Talkeetna ten years late. One of the conditions Mary had for marrying Ken was that he install an actual front door on his cabin (instead of the piece of carpet that was covering the doorway).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1986 Ken and Mary welcomed their oldest child, Ann, followed by their second child, Matthew in 1989. After his children flew the coop Ken (and Mary) replaced them with a series of increasingly insane Spaniels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken played catcher with the Mandingos for many years, until June 1987 when he suffered a career-ending injury sliding into 3rd base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken continued to serve with the fire department. He was promoted to fire chief in 1994 and later to district chief. He retired from the fire department on April 1, 2015, after 35+ years of service. He retired from CH2M Hill in January 2016. Upon retirement, he promptly returned to his 1970s self and smoked the largest blunt he could find.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In retirement Ken found fulfillment in spending time with Mary, tending to his garden, trying to outsmart the moose who kept eating his garden, playing poker, drinking coffee with friends, and going on \u201cboy&#8217;s trips\u201d to Vegas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken is survived by his wife of 38 years, Mary Farina of Talkeetna, AK; his offspring, Ann Farina of Washington and Matt Farina (Carolyn) of Alaska; as well as many nieces, nephews, cousins, friends, and drinking\/smoking\/poker buddies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ken was preceded in death by his parents, sister Carol Farina, and at least a couple of people he beat at poker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A celebration of life\/ice cream social will be held at the Talkeetna Fire Hall in Talkeetna, AK in July 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Ken\u2019s name to the Talkeetna Volunteer Fire Department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Farina family would like to extend their gratitude to the Sunshine Community Health Clinic (especially Layla, Ryan, and Janelle), the staff of Mat-Su Wound Care, the staff of Midnight Sun Oncology, and the nurses, doctors, and other care providers who cared for Ken in the last week of his life.<\/p>\n","articleSection":["Memorials"],"wordCount":666},{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Article","@id":"https:\/\/ktna.org\/Schema\/Article\/77637","description":"Jean Richardson Nov 12, 1933 &#8211; Sep 25, 2021 Jean Carey Richardson, 87, passed away on Saturday, Sept. 25, 2021, at her home in Eagle River, Alaska.
