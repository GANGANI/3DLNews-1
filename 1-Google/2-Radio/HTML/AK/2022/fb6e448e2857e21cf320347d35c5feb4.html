I think anybody can attest to that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nConscious Coffee: It\u2019s been a really good summer. People have been pretty friendly. It hasn\u2019t been terribly overwhelming.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDancing Leaf Gallery: Oh, the summer was great. We had, of course, a lot more visitors than we usually have. It was kind of an interesting dynamic. People were excited to be here on the cruise ships. Last year was a little different. A lot of people were just excited to be out of the house, so they were willing to spend a little more money. But this year, they were a little bit more frugal, although the numbers were high.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFairview Inn: Busier than usual, lots of softball. Lots of softball. Lots of drinkers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShirley&#8217;s Northern Lights Gourmet Ice Cream: It was busy. Busier than last year, probably because the COVID restrictions have been lifted a little. I would say 500 people a day, in June and July, so that was pretty good. \n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nTalkeetna Air Taxi: And it\u2019s probably unprecedented in any climbing season that I\u2019ve ever heard of that we had basically 100 days in a row of clear weather. Even guides were up on the mountain reporting they hadn\u2019t seen a snowflake in their whole 20 day expedition on Denali. So, that\u2019s as rare as it can be, really. That might be a one-in-a-hundred year event, I would guess.\u00a0\n\n\n\nConscious Coffee: I would say the highlight was the fourth of July parade, when we had a line out to the road and it started and Brenda was like, \u201cOh, hold on, we\u2019re gonna go watch the parade, and we all stood on the road for fifteen minutes and just enjoyed it while everyone waited in line for us to come back.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDancing Leaf Gallery: All in all it was a fabulous summer. We\u2019re very pleased with it, and most of the people were just so happy to be here in Alaska.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFairview Inn: We have a new owner, so everything\u2019s been worked on around here a lot. It\u2019s nice. The improvements are good. I\u2019m optimistic about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShirley&#8217;s Northern Lights Gourmet Ice Cream: I mean it didn\u2019t rain once between April and almost August, so that was nice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nTalkeetna Air Taxi: The best part of the job is probably putting all the elements together, and making it run smoothly. Between getting a good, talented bunch of pilots together who will fly safely, putting an office staff together that really works well with everybody.\u00a0\n\n\n\nConscious Coffee: I think the energy. The energy of my coworkers, and the fun back here. Just, fun amidst chaos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDancing Leaf Gallery: I get to look at art every day, and I get to sell art to people who really appreciate it. And it\u2019s fun to match the art to the person to make sure it matches their dynamic and their personality. So, it\u2019s a great job if you love people and love art.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFairview Inn: You get to be yourself, do it yourself, and have a little team behind you. It\u2019s independent, for the most part.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShirley&#8217;s Northern Lights Gourmet Ice Cream: It\u2019s just fun, the atmosphere. All the people that work here are nice. You know, everyone in Talkeetna is just friendly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\n\nFairview Inn: Yep, and the beer garden improvements really helped because people wanted to hang out in the sun, and we had a lot of that. And now they just want to be inside, drinking coffee and Budlight.\u00a0And I can\u2019t wait until fall and winter, when we have our town back and can see all our friends again in here, instead of the strangers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWith the major lodges closing in a few days, that time is coming very soon. \n\n\n\nFor KTNA, I\u2019m Nell Salzman.&nbsp;","articleBody":"\n<p><em>As summer winds down in Talkeetna, KTNA did a quick survey of spokespeople from some local businesses to see how it went.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talkeetna Air Taxi: Well, we haven\u2019t looked over the numbers yet, but I would say it was a pretty robust number of people through the town this year.

Durr is incredibly grateful for and excited about this opportunity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal in our little world. You know, it\u2019s not the Nobel Prize, but in my world it kind of is.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDurr explains that he\u2019s been applying to this grant for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you throw a line in the water, you may not catch a fish. If you do not throw a line in the water, you won\u2019t catch a fish. So I\u2019ve been applying every year for a number of years and finally caught a fish.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDurr started playing music at age six, and has been playing professionally since age sixteen. His father was an impressive visual artist as well, and also played folk guitar. He taught Durr the basics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy dad was a great painter. And together we lived a life of total involvement with each other\u2019s art.\n\n\n\nDurr came to Talkeetna in June of 1970. He was twenty, and explored with his dad. They found a lake on the map and stayed there. He feels that it must have fostered his creativity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not really what you call a career move, going out into the wilderness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt that time, Durr had already been to New York City and had a recording contract with a major label. But, he ended up in Alaska.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor most of his life, he played music and his dad painted.\n\n\n\nWhen he passed away some years ago, I just picked up his brushes and his paints and went at it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDurr\u2019s music and art practices influence each other.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe creative aspect comes from the same place. It\u2019s just a different medium, different tools.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDurr gets a lot of his inspiration visually from the wilderness around him.\n\n\n\nOnce you start, you just can\u2019t stop.

Durr is incredibly grateful for and excited about this opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a big deal in our little world. You know, it\u2019s not the Nobel Prize, but in my world it kind of is.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durr explains that he\u2019s been applying to this grant for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you throw a line in the water, you may not catch a fish.

So I\u2019ve been applying every year for a number of years and finally caught a fish.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durr started playing music at age six, and has been playing professionally since age sixteen. His father was an impressive visual artist as well, and also played folk guitar. He taught Durr the basics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My dad was a great painter. And together we lived a life of total involvement with each other\u2019s art.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durr came to Talkeetna in June of 1970. He was twenty, and explored with his dad. They found a lake on the map and stayed there. He feels that it must have fostered his creativity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s not really what you call a career move, going out into the wilderness.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, Durr had already been to New York City and had a recording contract with a major label. But, he ended up in Alaska.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of his life, he played music and his dad painted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When he passed away some years ago, I just picked up his brushes and his paints and went at it.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durr\u2019s music and art practices influence each other.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The creative aspect comes from the same place. It\u2019s just a different medium, different tools.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durr gets a lot of his inspiration visually from the wilderness around him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once you start, you just can\u2019t stop.

He lights up when he talks about the Alaskan Range.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpent the first half of my life trying to climb it and the second half of my life mucking around in the mud of it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Susitna River starts at Susitna Glacier and flows southwest to Cook Inlet, which is a 27-mile flight from Anchorage. It\u2019s 313 miles long and Wood lives up along it in a cabin he built with his wife, Molly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s navigable 85 miles from its mouth all the way to Talkeetna. Wood says he doesn\u2019t even know the last 100 miles, and doesn\u2019t have any plans to go there until his last days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYeah, you know some people jump on an ice flow. I might just get in a canoe and go through Devil\u2019s Canyon and let it sweep me out the other end.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCo-founder of Susitna Salmon Company\u2014a small fishermen-seller direct setnet operation\u2014Wood lives at the base of the river every summer for five weeks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWood and his crew fishing at sunset. \n\n\n\nSo, he\u2019s very in tune with the strips of mud that appear along the shore before the oceanic tide washes in, with the way that fish populations ebb and flow, and the exact spots where beluga whales and seals like to feed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd I mean it\u2019s the fourth largest king salmon run in the state, you know? And it\u2019s so wild still, and it\u2019s incredible. Only two bridges cross it in the whole watershed, and that\u2019s up on the Denali highway and on the parks highway.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis river is just not covered culturally in Alaska, despite the fact that there is no larger river that people live by. But it\u2019s the most recreated river in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople fly over it and build cabins all along it. You just can\u2019t drive to many parts of it. Unlike other popular fishing spots in Alaska, salmon run numbers are not updated regularly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Su is like the lonesome stepchild of Cook Inlet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the 15th largest river in the U.S. measured in volume at its base. It runs along the west side of the Talkeetna Mountains, past Talkeetna. It receives water from numerous other rivers\u2014including the Deshka, Talkeetna, Yentna, Oshetna, and Tyone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, Wood has been a strong voice against the proposed Susitna Hydroelectric project on the Susitna River. During his campaign, he became familiar with the watershed. He says there are sockeye salmon everywhere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSu Salmon Co mid-cleaning operation. \n\n\n\nDuring the Su hydro studies we were camped out in these sloughs all the time. You know, just hanging out. And, at night the water would be boiling from fish spawning beside the tent. Nobody could see them because they were under murky water.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fish spawn way up in creeks. Lakes are the typical spawning grounds for sockeye, but there are in-river spawners. They spawn in side channels, and look for places where there is good gravel and groundwater so their eggs won\u2019t freeze in the winter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHence, the anadromous part. They come in from the salt, they spawn, and then the young ones are born in the fresh and have to adapt to returning to the salt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe area where the dam was proposed was what Wood calls the bread basket of Unit 13 and all of the moose and caribou for Mat-Su and Anchorage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd a lot of people don\u2019t understand what a load-following dam would do to a river.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWood says that the whole ecosystem relies on the active watershed\u2014the glacial run-off and incoming tides from the ocean. It\u2019s a vibrant and critical fish and wildlife habitat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis place is for me still like a whetstone where you can keep your edge sharp. I just love grinding away in it every day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMike Wood and his dog, Mabel. \n\n\n\nWood says the river has given him so much that he\u2019s committed to paying attention and giving back to it in the ways he can.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor KTNA, I\u2019m Nell Salzman.","articleBody":"\n<p>Chair of the board for the Matsu Fish and Wildlife Commission Mike Wood came to Alaska to do a semester course with the National Outdoor Leadership School and never left.

He says there are sockeye salmon everywhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-81566\" width=\"489\" height=\"734\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-533x800.jpg 533w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/DSCF1222-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" \/><figcaption>Su Salmon Co mid-cleaning operation. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>During the Su hydro studies we were camped out in these sloughs all the time. You know, just hanging out. And, at night the water would be boiling from fish spawning beside the tent. Nobody could see them because they were under murky water.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fish spawn way up in creeks. Lakes are the typical spawning grounds for sockeye, but there are in-river spawners. They spawn in side channels, and look for places where there is good gravel and groundwater so their eggs won\u2019t freeze in the winter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hence, the anadromous part. They come in from the salt, they spawn, and then the young ones are born in the fresh and have to adapt to returning to the salt.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The area where the dam was proposed was what Wood calls the bread basket of Unit 13 and all of the moose and caribou for Mat-Su and Anchorage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And a lot of people don\u2019t understand what a load-following dam would do to a river.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood says that the whole ecosystem relies on the active watershed\u2014the glacial run-off and incoming tides from the ocean. It\u2019s a vibrant and critical fish and wildlife habitat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This place is for me still like a whetstone where you can keep your edge sharp. I just love grinding away in it every day.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"
