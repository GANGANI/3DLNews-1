What follows is a transcript of a portion of their conversation.  The transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nAs we have been discussing the incredible pikes in temperatures, droughts, fires and glacier melt off for the summer of 2019, is the conversation with the general public of those that accept climate change or not getting any easier?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nI would say on balance, it is getting easier.\n\n\n\nI think most people that I run into, you know, there&#8217;s not a lot of discussion about it. But I think what you see, from the policy side of things, that implementing change is difficult. There&#8217;s an inertia that&#8217;s difficult to overcome. And there&#8217;s always people that don&#8217;t want to do anything. And so, you know, from the policymaker point of view, the path of least resistance can sometimes be: \u201cYeah, I don&#8217;t know what can we do about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut we are seeing quite a change, in again what I experienced but also what I see in interaction with other people. The discussion is more of: \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d \u2026Not, \u201cShould we do anything?\u201d\n\n\n\nSolar panels at Chugach Farm in Chickaloon.  Photo by Jed Workman, courtesy of Allie Barker\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nWe know that the carbon emissions are one of the great contributors, and how can we reduce this?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nAnd people don&#8217;t like to hear this, but there are certain, you know, regulations matter\u2026things like vehicle fuel efficiency standards, or, you know, your refrigerator\u2026 energy efficiency, we don&#8217;t think about that much. But, you know, just the energy efficiency and household appliances has made a tremendous reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants over the last several decades.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nDuring the summers there&#8217;s a lot more sunlight and there&#8217;s the solar technology that is very capable. Do you have any comments about that?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nRenewable energy is in many cases now is cost effective or more cost effective than traditional energy sources, particularly for power, whether it&#8217;s a coal power plant, or now even natural gas power plants. And so it becomes a \u2018win-win\u2019 \u2026you help the environment, you help the planet, you help future generations. But you also have lower fuel bills and something I would consider very Alaskan\u2026is that you become less dependent; you don&#8217;t always need that power line coming into your house or your cabin if you are going to be generating your own electricity through solar or wind or whatever.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nWell, it really is important to feel the potential of these technologies that are really\u2026 you know, a lot of Alaskans are already off the grid, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of people that are very savvy with that and when you see it, you see how simple it really is. And it&#8217;s a matter of the initial cost to set things up and the long term benefits are fantastic.\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nAbsolutely. And of course some are better suited than others. Right? So solar, works great in the summer and not so much in the winter.\u00a0 Much of interior Alaska, mainland Alaska; it doesn&#8217;t have wind in the winter or you worry about say, turbine blades getting rime coated or otherwise having problems in the cold. So you know, if you&#8217;re generating power in the summer off the grid, and then you\u2019re plugged in for the other half of the year, you&#8217;ve reduced, your carbon footprint production by half. So, it doesn&#8217;t need to be an all or nothing. Little things can add up.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nThis fall in particular, there has been a lot of momentum building with young climate activists who are striking about climate change, including leader Greta Thunberg. Do you have anything you want to comment about that?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nYou know, in my own kids who are now 12 and 14. They are inspired by the movement. You know, even for old people like myself, it&#8217;s inspiring.&nbsp; I was on my computer about two months ago and I got a little notification on my account that said, \u201cGrete Thunberg has followed you.\u201d Whoa, you know, I feel this now, a responsibility to put out useful information for people that are looking to make changes and make a difference in the world.\n\n\n\nSolar panels provide power even in the winter for Chugach farm.  Photo by Jed Workman, courtesy of Allie Barker\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nI think, if we were to highlight three things that we talked about here is: One, recognizing the changes. Secondly, is being able to discuss these changes and work together with amongst the various organizations. And thirdly, what little differences can people make?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nPeople sometimes get hung up\u2026 is a thing. \u201cWell, you know, I need to change everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, sometimes, if a lot of people change a little bit of things, then that can really, really, really add up.","articleBody":"\n<p>KTNA\u2019s Katie Writer recently spoke with Brian Brettschneider, research climatologist with International Arctic Research Center and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\u00a0 In this second segment, they discuss possible actions Alaskans can take to impact greenhouse gas emissions going forward.

And so it becomes a \u2018win-win\u2019 \u2026you help the environment, you help the planet, you help future generations. But you also have lower fuel bills and something I would consider very Alaskan\u2026is that you become less dependent; you don&#8217;t always need that power line coming into your house or your cabin if you are going to be generating your own electricity through solar or wind or whatever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Writer :<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it really is important to feel the potential of these technologies that are really\u2026 you know, a lot of Alaskans are already off the grid, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of people that are very savvy with that and when you see it, you see how simple it really is. And it&#8217;s a matter of the initial cost to set things up and the long term benefits are fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Brettschneider :<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. And of course some are better suited than others. Right? So solar, works great in the summer and not so much in the winter.\u00a0 Much of interior Alaska, mainland Alaska; it doesn&#8217;t have wind in the winter or you worry about say, turbine blades getting rime coated or otherwise having problems in the cold. So you know, if you&#8217;re generating power in the summer off the grid, and then you\u2019re plugged in for the other half of the year, you&#8217;ve reduced, your carbon footprint production by half. So, it doesn&#8217;t need to be an all or nothing. Little things can add up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Writer :<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fall in particular, there has been a lot of momentum building with young climate activists who are striking about climate change, including leader Greta Thunberg. Do you have anything you want to comment about that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Brettschneider :<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, in my own kids who are now 12 and 14. They are inspired by the movement. You know, even for old people like myself, it&#8217;s inspiring.&nbsp; I was on my computer about two months ago and I got a little notification on my account that said, \u201cGrete Thunberg has followed you.\u201d Whoa, you know, I feel this now, a responsibility to put out useful information for people that are looking to make changes and make a difference in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_8983.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-67169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_8983.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_8983-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption>Solar panels provide power even in the winter for Chugach farm.

A lot of people kind of came up to me either, you know, formally or informally and said,\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\u201cHey, this has been a great summer, but then at the same time, \u2026this is really bad for Alaska and for the long term.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt really highlighted to people, how much things have changed, and in many ways, what the future might look like. And that was what, you know, the exceptionally warm temperatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPart of that was also the tremendous smoke that occurred with the fires.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nWhat are the top three weather climate abnormalities of this past six months that surprised you the most, Brian?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nWell, I don\u2019t even know where to begin. You know, when myself and some other people, you know, we come up with monthly and seasonal summaries and sometimes, we always try to come up with, you know, kind of some highlights to point out, that will be attention grabbing and sometimes we kind of struggle to say,\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, was there anything really noteworthy, but this summer really was off the charts. You know, without question, the tremendous warmth, particularly in the month of July, statewide. You know, we broke the record for the warmest Alaska by a wide margin. We literally are the difference now between this July and then the second warmest July is about the same difference as the second warmest and the 20th warmest. So, normally records are broken by tiny slivers, but to absolutely smash a statewide record. And we have data that goes back, you know, at least 100 years, and in some cases more than that. So it was really, really, really remarkable.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat other climate phenomena piqued your interest this summer?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider :\n\n\n\nI would say the next thing is in the southern half of the state, the remarkably dry August, particularly south of the Alaska Range, there was a very sharp gradient. So, Denali Park, their wettest month on record, not just August or July, any month in a year \u2026they had their wettest month on record. Yet, Talkeetna just a little bit to the south was in an exceptional drought as defined by the US Drought Monitor. So that gradient and then the exceptional dryness when it should be the wettest time of the year was really noteworthy. The individual daily records that were set at places like Northway, and Kodiak, and Anchorage and Bethel, all time records. And these are things that grabbed national and even international attention. I got calls from European news organizations to talk about these things, national news. Noted to people that, \u201cHey you grew up in the Arctic, we can have these kind of really exceptional temperatures. And then what does that mean for the future?\u201d\n\n\n\nKatie Writer&nbsp;:\n\n\n\nWhat do you have any projections of what we can expect for this winter?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider&nbsp;:\n\n\n\nI get asked that question a lot.\n\n\n\nMy answer is, knowing nothing else about the climate system, you should always assume it\u2019s going to be warmer than normal. So when we say normal, they\u2019re about a, the standard convention is to use a 30 year baseline period and say, okay, that\u2019s a current snapshot of the climate. We\u2019re actually warming so much faster than you know, we haven\u2019t in previous generations, that that 30 years snapshot is already behind the times. It\u2019s already reflecting a climate that was cooler than it is now. So, we should always expect it to be warmer than what we what we define as the climate normal.\n\n\n\nTalkeetna, where three rivers meet, experienced high water despite a dry summer due to glacier melt.  Photo by Katie Writer &#8211; KTNA\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nYou know, one thing that we have nearby is of course, the whole Alaska Range with the multiple glaciers and the glacier melt off was just huge this past summer. Our rivers were up even during the drought the rivers were bank full. Talkeetna was even, you know, on the edge of being, you know, worried about flooding from just no rainfall, but just glacier melting. Do you have any thoughts on this trend of the glacier melt off?\n\n\n\nBrian Brettschneider&nbsp;:\n\n\n\nWell, you know, warm summers and glacier melt, unfortunately go hand in hand. You know, in many cases, what really can make an Alaska summer warm, is the lack of cloud cover. And so that\u2019s exactly what we have this year. We had a record low cloud cover throughout the entire state in June and July. And that sun, just relentlessly beats down on the glaciers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese glaciers are right on the edge of, you know, growing or receding. But once they start receding, it\u2019s really hard to turn that around.\n\n\n\nKatie Writer :\n\n\n\nScientist have documented that Alaska has lost more glaciers than any other region in the world in the last fifty years.&nbsp;","articleBody":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"712\" src=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_2460-1024x712.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-67106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_2460-1024x712.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_2460-300x208.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ktna.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG_2460-768x534.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Near the toe of the Ruth Glacier in September of 2019.
