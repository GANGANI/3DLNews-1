Photo by Phillip Manning &#8211; KTNA\nThe Don Sheldon Amphitheater on the Ruth Glacier is one of the most striking vistas in the Alaska Range. In the midst of miles of mountains and ice in the amphitheater sits a small structure that has been there since the 1960s. Over the years, hundreds have taken shelter inside what has become known as the \u201cMountain House.\u201d The building sits on a nunatak, an outcropping of rock surrounded by ice and snow. Now, a second, larger building stands on the nunatak as well, the Sheldon Chalet.\nThe property the Sheldon Mountain House and Chalet occupy has a unique status. The land was claimed by Don Sheldon in the mid-1950s under the Homestead Act. Later, Denali National Park and Preserve expanded and surrounded the property. Don and Roberta Sheldon\u2019s son Robert explains that means his family has rights beyond what landowners in other areas of the park do.\n\u201cOur neighbors, Denali National Park, came ten miles closer to us, and then past us and surrounded us in 1980\u2026.So, what we are, technically, is a holding.\u201d\nEffectively, that means the Sheldons\u2019 land is a piece of private property completely surrounded by Denali National Park. Because of that, they were able to build the Chalet, land helicopters, and other things that are typically prohibited in the park.\nWhere the old mountain house is basic and rugged in its accommodations, the Sheldon Chalet is\nAn example of the lunch offerings guests of the Sheldon Chalet can expect. Photo by Phillip Manning &#8211; KTNA\nthe epitome of luxury. Arriving guests are treated to a lunch that can feature items including halibut, oysters, and Alaska King Crab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Sheldon\u2019s wife, Marne, says guests of the Chalet will likely be looking for the most Alaskan experience possible, so it only makes sense to take advantage of what the state has to offer.\n\u201cAlaska seafood is amazing, right? So why would we have an experience without that?&#8230;Not only the seafood, but the beer, and our beverages, and everything from Denali Brewing that we can source from them \u2013 keeping it local, keeping it authentic, because when people come to Alaska, that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\u201d\nThe food is far from what one would normally expect to eat while staying on a glacier, and the quality of accommodations and amenities are comparable to what one would find in a luxury hotel anywhere else in the world.\nRoom decor is very comfortable, and kept intentionally simple so as not to distract from the breathtaking views of the Alaska Range. Photo by Phillip Manning &#8211; KTNA\nAn inevitable part of any overnight stay in the wilderness, and particularly in the mountains, is what happens when nature calls. Marne says guests at the Sheldon Chalet will be using bathrooms that will feature almost all the familiar fixtures.\n\u201cWe have an incinerating toilet, which requires no water\u2014kinda the eco-friendly way of having something nicer than a [clean mountain can]\u2026So here, somebody can come to Denali and experience a normal\u2014within reason normal\u2014home or hotel bathroom.\u201d\nWhile the building, its surroundings, and its accommodations are beautiful, safety has to be considered as well. After all, the Chalet sits at nearly 6,000 feet of elevation in a mountain range and near a significant fault line. Robert Sheldon says the building is very firmly attached to the nunatak on which it sits.\n\u201cOur base that we could build off of is super, super stable to begin with, so our seismicity is the highest rating you can receive for a structure. We also built the building with a number of components where we made sure we anchored in really well.\u201d\nIn addition, Robert says the Chalet was engineered to withstand the winds of a Category 5 hurricane for two days, though he adds that sustained winds in the area have only been observed at less than half that speed.\nAs with anything related to flying in and out of the Alaska Range, weather is an important consideration. The plan is for guests to generally spend three or four days at the Chalet, but what happens when the weather prevents flights in and out? Robert Sheldon says delays are likely to be minimal, and Chalet guests could use the opportunity to spend time in Talkeetna.\n\u201cAny given day, you\u2019ve got a sixty-percent-plus chance of getting in unless it\u2019s helicopter, [then]\nGuests of the Sheldon Chalet will typically spend at least part of their journey on a helicopter. Photo by Phillip Manning &#8211; KTNA\nit\u2019s well into the eighties. You might have a day delay, so to pivot off Talkeetna is to utilize the Historical Society, to go to some of the shops, maybe they take a boat ride\u2026\u201d\nIn fact, Robert says he hopes the tourism business the Chalet attracts will have carry-over effects into Talkeetna, with people either spending a day in or around town. He says where Alaska tourism has lacked is in targeting the high-end market. That\u2019s something he and the other investors in the Chalet plan to address.\nThe dining area of the Sheldon Chalet features spectacular views of Denali. Photo by Phillip Manning &#8211; KTNA\n\u201cThis is the crown jewel, though. This place is to focus effort on Denali, and it\u2019s probably as high-end as you\u2019re going to receive in Alaska.\u201d\nThe price tag for a stay at the Sheldon Chalet bears out the plan to target the high-end tourism market, with a night costing over $2,000 per pillow.\nSomething I wanted to know was how the new building fit with the legacy of Don and Roberta Sheldon, two people of near legendary status in Talkeetna. Robert Sheldon says he and his sister, Kate, had begun plans on the Chalet when Roberta passed away in 2014. When going through Roberta\u2019s papers, they discovered plans from 1968 for a similar structure. Then, in 2015, building materials began to melt out of the ice that Don Sheldon evidently flew up to the glacier in the years before his passing. Robert says those discoveries told him that they were on the right path.\nThe cover sheet for plans ordered by Don Sheldon in 1968. The Sheldon Chalet is intentionally similar to the plans in many respects. Photo courtesy of Robert Sheldon.\n\u201cIt was really spectacular that, not only did we find these plans, but it actually was already underway. My dad was trying to do stuff. There were two of the floor joists up here. I have no idea how he actually got them up here.\u201d\nRoberta Sheldon often had strong opinions about development and conservation in Alaska. Robert believes there are ways to both develop and remain conscious of the preservation of nature.\n\u201cI think we, as a family, are staying true to what our parents demonstrated: There\u2019s a way to get along; There\u2019s a way to cooperate; There\u2019s a way to advance together.\nMy final question to Robert and Kate Sheldon was what they think Roberta would say if she\nKate and Robert Sheldon describing how the Chalet came to be.
