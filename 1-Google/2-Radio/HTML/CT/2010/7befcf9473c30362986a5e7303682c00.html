Sharing the slot with the other &quot;Ambient Team&quot; members is a rewarding experience. I love many genres of music, and ambient music is definitely one of my favorites!<br />

		&quot;Mind Matters&quot;<br />
		&quot;Mind Matters&quot; is the brainchild of Aryeh Herman and Tara Taylor, both doctoral candidates in the University of Hartford&#39;s Graduate Institute of Professional Psychology (GIPP). The inspiration for the show came from another psychology-based radio show in Washington D.C., the &quot;Infinite Mind&quot;, but there was a fundamental problem. It didn&#39;t appeal to a younger audience. Both Herman and Taylor are passionate about &quot;spreading knowledge&quot; and informing college students about what is taking place around them. While the show&#39;s primary focus is on mental health, neuroscience and psychology&#39;s uses, the material is presented in such a way even non-science majors will find it interesting and understandable. Discussions will be based on topics common on college campuses such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders.<br />

		There&rsquo;s too much great music being created in the world every day to listen to the same things over and over. WWUH has blessed me with the opportunity to hear all kinds of creative sounds and explore new ways of presenting music. Whether challenging progressive rock orthodoxy in the late 70&rsquo;s or doing bluegrass fill-ins in the 80&rsquo;s&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always strived to bring together differrent styles and communities.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m always trying to learn more about where music comes from - its roots and important innovators - as well as where it&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; Doing jazz programs comes naturally, since it&#39;s a diverse musical world in and of itself. When everything clicks, the music flows from one style, era, culture or feeling to another.</p>

		Urged on by Bill Domler in 1983 (?), Ed took the Tuesday FM-on-Toast slot, planning to play old-timey bands; but after a few shows, he saw an accumulation of Celtic records (yes, all was vinyl) and shifted the focus to his Scots-Irish roots, discovering Welsh and Breton artists along the road to 1988 when he left the air for business pursuits. He&#39;s amazed and grateful at the persistent popularity of Celtica in Hartford, due in no small part to the creative and energetic Steve Dieterich, whose westward migration in November 2016 bequeathed this heritage back to Ed. He plans to develop more support for local artists while exploring the widening exposure of Celtic themes in Cornwall, Galicia and other points east.</p>
