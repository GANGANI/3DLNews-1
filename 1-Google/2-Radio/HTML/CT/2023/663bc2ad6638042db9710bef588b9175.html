<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Staff meeting 04/02/23</h3>



<ul><li>Welcome to our penultimate meeting of this academic year! Thanks for joining us. We only have one more staff meeting after today.</li><li>Special thanks to Tom Christopher for his talk at our meeting last month, sharing how he has been able to grow his gardening program, “Growing Greener”.</li><li>Board updates (also note we will be having elections next staff meeting so at the end of each update you will hear a bit about the role). To start President needs to be someone who has served on the board and is responsible for conducting all meetings. Sends out communications for all things WESU. </li><li>Training updates<ul><li>Written exams will be after today’s meeting.</li><li>Position is open to both community members and students.</li></ul></li><li>Music Directors<ul><li>Red Scroll field trip this morning.</li><li>One of the spots needs to be filled by a student.</li></ul></li><li>Events<ul><li>Seeming less and less likely but we might still be able to make something pledge drive related happen! Stay tuned.</li><li>Events does have to be held by a student because of access to room booking portal. </li></ul></li><li>Public Relations<ul><li>New merch store is about to launch soon.</li><li>This position is social media and all things press. Lots of design opportunities.</li></ul></li><li>Program<ul><li>Thanks to everyone who helped to keep programming solid over break. With a few exceptions, folks made sure their time was covered.</li><li>Summer Program: Details TBA about wrapping up our spring program and how to participate in the summer program are forthcoming. Summer is a good time for new DJs to get some airtime and for those who will be around to perhaps even grab a little extra! Students who are around for the summer please consider grabbing a shift.</li></ul></li><li>Production<ul><li>Need new spring pledge drive promos. Great opportunity to gain some production experience and earn a service hour!</li><li>If you have experience in digital audio workspaces this is a great role.</li></ul></li><li>Tech<ul><li>Still troubleshooting TuneIn schedule</li><li>Responsible for Spinitron accounts and organizing all other things tech.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Public Affairs<ul><li>In charge of producing the FCC public affairs report. At least 50% of WESU’s programming is public affairs.</li></ul></li><li>Vice President<ul><li>Primary responsibilities are the budget and note taking for each board and staff meeting. </li></ul></li><li>Over to Ben M<ul><li>In early June a group called the Golden Rule who sail for a nuclear free future are coming to visit Middletown Harbor Park. There is a meeting with Middletown Mayor w Veterans for peace organizer on Tuesday if anyone is interested in joining (email Ben). </li></ul></li><li>Pledge drive Fall/Winter<ul><li>Pledge promos have gone out with a handful of exceptions (need some hoody sizes). Ben is now working back though the Spring 22 premiums and there are a few back ordered from even further back (FA21). Luckily, donors have been very patient.&nbsp;</li><li>Moving forward, we are going to utilize a new online T-Shirt Store called Bonfire! Our PR Director Sarah has been working hard to get our new Bonfire shop ready. This company will ship the shirts directly to the donor, thus ensuring we don’t get backed up again! It&#8217;s going to take us another week or so to get it together but we should be up and running for the last month of school, which means mid-April.</li><li>Details on Spring Pledge Drive will be forthcoming – but the basics remain the same:<ul><li>$25K goal – No matching gift lined up yet.</li><li>DJs will be required to include pledge pitches during live and pre recorded shows.</li><li>Off air pitching and on air “gimmicks” are great ways to increase your likelihood of raising money.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Please help us produce new pledge promos. We have some great classic material but we REALLY need some new stuff! There will be a pledge binder in the studio to help you with basic info. Keep an eye out for pledge packets that you can put in the hands of potential donors.</li></ul>



<p>** As mentioned we will be using a new T-shirt vendor this year which should expedite the shipping of our thank you gifts. There will be a discount code for Wesleyan students and WESU volunteers to purchase swag at a discount.</p>



<ul><li>Closing Remarks&nbsp;<ul><li>Remind folks that they should consider running for a board position.</li><li>Elections take place at our next meeting on May 7.</li><li>Candidates need to announce their candidacy via a letter of intent sent by staff email by Sunday 5/30 (1 week before last meeting). Only candidates who submit a letter of intent will be allowed to deliver a “stump speech” and respond to staff questions, just prior to the election. Write-in candidates will be allowed, but will not be able to make a speech. Contact any board member with questions!</li></ul></li></ul>

Current DJ please consider hosting trainees on your show to help them learn the studio and complete their required internships.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Promos<ul><li>Great to hear many new ones! Now we need some new Fall/Winter Pledge drive promos. Also need to organize our current stash to ready for pledge drive.</li><li>Cyrus has organized all current promos in the appropriate places: the google drive and studio computer. DJs&nbsp; should check for their promos and let him know if they can’t find it. Cyrus also created new folders for current pledge drive promos. Staff should contact Cyrus if they’re interested in doing a pledge promo for a service hour @ <a href="mailto:producion@wesufm.org">producion@wesufm.org</a></li></ul></li><li>Music Directors<ul><li>Reminder to play new releases! Check the new MD playlists and let MDs know if there is music you’d like to see in the studio that we are currently not getting. For service hours, we could potentially use some help organizing the CDs in studio A.</li></ul></li><li>VP Update<ul><li>Over $27,000 approved for budget. Starting to engage 45 Broad</li></ul></li><li>Public Affairs<ul><li>Theo is working on compiling list&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Follow up on the sexual harassment policy.<ul><li>THANKS TO THE STAFF MEMBER WHO BROUGHT THIS UP AT THE LAST MEETING. <strong>Wesleyan students, faculty, and staff are all required to commit to the university policy. </strong>During training, we are going to require all new staff to review and sign on to the policy.&nbsp;</li><li>Long time DJs should all have signed on to this policy when it was implemented but have likely not seen any updates since. As such we will now be including a step in our program application process to ensure all current staff are up to date on the latest policy. We can spend time on training at a staff meeting if need be.</li></ul></li><li>Self promotions and calls to action<ul><li>Just following up on Ben’s last email on this subject. A few important details about FCC policies got dropped from the code of conduct when it was consolidated about 10 years back.<strong> Unless talking about a legitimate non profit organization, or efforts to raise money for WESU, </strong>the FCC strictly forbids education stations from mentioning prices for specific products, services, and events. The FCC considers pricing information, including the word &#8220;free&#8221; to be an incentive to support said product, service, or organization. Using non commercial airwaves to promote a product or service is forbidden. That doesn&#8217;t mean that we cannot explore these subjects. DJs need to make sure they present findings in a factual informative way that enables listeners to decide what they think while avoiding hyperbole and calls to action. IF you want to incorporate your personal view, that&#8217;s fine too, just remind listeners that it’s your view and not the view of WESU. This all simply means that we should not be telling listeners what to do or think. This includes religious/spiritual calls to action around faith. Shows that deal with spirituality and faith should be sure to understand all of the rules around promotions.</li></ul></li><li>Pledge Drive &#8211; goal is 25K by NYE<ul><li>Starting this week, we want folks to casually start working pledge promos into their shows.</li></ul><ul><li>For now, play them at least 4 times per show<strong>. </strong>We will increase frequency and our expectations. Check the binder in the air studio for pledge pitches and more.</li><li>Will add our pledge tally to the white board in the studio but the thermometer on our web page is the best place to find the most up to date tally info.</li><li>Off-air pitching to the people in your life who are familiar with your radio work is the best way to bring in donations in support of your show.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10/5 Board Meeting</h3>



<ul><li>Attendance: No Sam, Mary.&nbsp;</li><li>Staff meeting success. Probably need some signs. Need to figure out the ID situation. No attendance sheet. But, we should verify who was there. Ben should make an attendance sheet for next time.&nbsp;</li><li>Budget updates. Disappointed in SBC support. What is the best strategic response? Should we submit an appeal vs. an additional budget request?&nbsp;<ul><li>All other stakeholders are rallying and growing their support, while the SBC is shrinking their support. Invite them to the station to learn more about our work. Were these cuts applied across the board? Are we being specifically targeted?&nbsp;</li><li>What to include in the email? Include as many numbers as possible. Stress the link in community partnerships. Name drop some alumni- emphasize our support in starting careers in radio. You support us less and less each year. We’re hoping that you reconsider and look closely at each line item and our needs, otherwise we will submit an additional response.&nbsp;</li><li>Draft a response and send it to Ben M and board.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Notes- Leith will be willing to publish them, and we can rotate the responsibility at each meeting.&nbsp;</li><li>Program guide- no updates. Might be worth following up with him on it.&nbsp;</li><li>T-shirts. CafePress is in-between fundraising. For this pledge drive, we can focus on a t-shirt design contest. In the Fall, we can work with designs that we have and create the Psychedelicatessen shirt. We can also retire these designs to CafePress later. Don’t get caught up in the design contest right now- just use old images.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben wondering if Gabby can reserve Exley room for training.&nbsp;<ul><li>Half-trained DJs. Ben has sent an email and half-trained DJs are reaching out via email. Create a Google Form or something of the like for people to submit their internships. Ben going to develop a plan for training new DJs and administering practical exams.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Gabby wondering when she will start doing pledge-drive stuff.

Will send an email update hopefully with the new music tonight.&nbsp;</li><li>Theo working on putting the public file together, talked to Ben M</li><li>Last Monday, microphone cords were broken with no note in the logs.

Don’t want to stall the process while waiting for the video- get people to do those internships as quickly as possible, with or without the video.<ul><li>Ben G will email half trained DJs.&nbsp;</li><li>We will send out a spreadsheet of who will take interns. Make Google Doc for signing up and have people email DJs correctly.&nbsp;</li><li>Opening guest policy to all students from Wesleyan as guests in the station?

Sarah can give Zoom link to those who want to help.&nbsp;<ul><li>Ben G should start looking into booking a space for training.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9/7 Meeting Notes</h3>



<ul><li>Attendance: missing Sam, Ben M, Ben S, Gabby (in person!)</li><li>Friday is Club Fair 2-5. Sarah will send Google Doc for sign ups.&nbsp;</li><li>Board hours<ul><li>Typically 4-6 everyday, staggered so that somebody is here every day. Update these with names on the website. Here to get tasks done and help people looking for service hours.</li></ul></li><li>Staff meeting<ul><li>Could try to reserve a tent. Could also just do this meeting virtually and then try to move the rest to in person. First Sunday of the month at 6- try to have Gabby book these out for the rest of the semester. Thinking about Exley, Shanklin, for next meetings.</li></ul></li><li>Record Fair<ul><li>Beckham is reserved on October 17th.&nbsp; Gabby wondering when to start reaching out to vendors- ASAP.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Production<ul><li>Sam should work on creating PSAs for record fair for DJs to run</li></ul></li><li>Training<ul><li>When do we want to start holding training sessions for the half trained DJs? We must all be trained first. We should all try to get trained this week before the season starts. Any highlighted shows in the program guide for summer are times when we would be able to come in and use the studio. Could Ben just film a video?</li><li>Do we want a completely new training this fall or do we just want to focus on retraining? About 30 half-trained staff. Send email to this group saying we are planning on training them in studio and gauging their interest before coming up with dates. Would also be helpful to have the video as a refresher for previously studio trained staff. Ben also wanting half-trainees to do internships. Could do new training in the second half of the semester. Leith suggests having the manual first might be a better way of getting committed and thoughtful DJs. Could create a sort of “traffic jam” in the studio. Internships are the bulk of the hands on learning. How does covid guest policy work with internships?&nbsp;</li><li>Could compress the training into longer training sessions less frequently to get everyone into the studio phase more quickly. Could then start training in the first half of October so we can deal with all the half-trainees in September.&nbsp;</li><li>Live vs. Prerecorded philosophy, especially with regard to missing shows. Fine to do virtual shows in transition period, then move to requiring live shows for the most part. Next semester, move back to live for everyone.&nbsp;</li><li>Tentative plan: we all get trained next week. Have Ben M/Annie video training session. Next week we pick dates for half trained staff.</li><li>For club fair, collect all emails then send email saying “Thank you for interest! Training will start in a month etc.”</li><li>Internships:&nbsp; could create a Calendly. Should ask for DJs to volunteer and standardize a number of interns they will allow.&nbsp;</li><li>Mary working on program guide!</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8/31 Meeting</h3>



<ul><li>Attendance: Missing Annie</li><li>Beginning of Fall season- 9/13? Starting not immediately after Labor Day weekend is the idea. All in agreement.&nbsp;</li><li>Training session for board, staff, and new DJs. Best to train board first. Looking to do it before the 13th- when is best for Leith? Could tie into the first board meeting.&nbsp;<ul><li>Tuesdays at 5 for board meetings? Sessions on this Sunday (4-5:30), this Thursday, and before the board meeting on Tuesday the 7th (4).&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Staff meeting on September 12th. Can we book Tishler, or the old bookstore? Preference for in person. Can&#8217;t book Tishler yet. Could plan on doing the staff meeting outside Shelissa has no other options.&nbsp; Gabby working with Shelissa to find our next best option.</li><li>&nbsp;Beckham is reserved for the record fair on the 17th. Outside guests must show proof of vaccination and be masked- do we do this through online registration, or could have folks bring vaccine card to the event. Ben M wonders if having it outside would be better for foot traffic. Sarah proposes better social media marketing to boost student turnout.&nbsp;</li><li>Interest in new DJ training. Telling folks to sign up at club fair, hoping to manage a training for new DJs, but not sure with retraining for the studio process for previously trained DJs.&nbsp;</li><li>Merch Store- want to add another archived design to the store coinciding with the new season. Sarah will show design options at the next meeting. Sarah will show Mary how to add the shirt to the site.&nbsp;</li><li>Guest speakers at staff meetings- is this something we want to continue? Ben M got feedback on events last year.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben M is happy to schedule time to chat with all board members about their positions.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8/2 Meeting</h3>



<ul><li>Attendance: All here except Ben M.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben M updates<ul><li>&nbsp;Good success on merch store sales! Now have a contingency plan because of frugal budgeting.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Sarah updates<ul><li>&nbsp;Wild Wild Live on backburner due to covid guest policy. Could feature bands on campus locally, who could potentially be allowed in the studio.</li><li>In person studio training- first training board, then training new DJ’s. Fall training for new DJs, then have live shows for them in the spring. Debate on still allowing remote shows- have previously prioritized live shows, but still want to allow flexibility in programming. Looking for veterans to retrain the board in the studio (Leith, James Fusion are recommended by Ben M). Host board training asap so we can help train others as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Setting dates for board meetings so we can reserve PAC- push back to right before the school year so we have a better sense of scheduling. First staff meeting on the second Sunday of the first month so that we have a week after move-in. Is PAC open? What is a potential alternative space?&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Ben S updates<ul><li>Deliberating calendar for fall program- send out apps this week, allow two weeks, and then have shows start the week of classes. Should we give people options for preferred methods of programming? Ben M suggests two separate applications for studio-trained and non-studio-trained staff members.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Gabby updates<ul><li>Heard back from SALD- Beckham not available at all in the Fall. There also won’t be tents, but there won’t be any indoor event space available, so outside without tents are the only options. Usdan courtyard as potential outdoor location for record fair. Could vendors bring in their own tents? Will we still be able to provide tables? Outside could be great for bringing in campus more, potentially only bringing in a few vendors rather than all 30 as done previously. Could we rent our own tents for CT rentals? Looking at October 10th or 17th as ideal dates. Gabby also to ask about PAC availability for staff meetings, and then follow up about alternatives for a group of 60-100.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6/24 Meeting</h3>



<ul><li>Attendance: No Ben S, Ben M, or Sam</li><li>Check in on everyone&#8217;s email access.</li><li>Ben M Updates<ul><li>Met pledge drive goal!&nbsp;</li><li>Need to figure out studio training for staff members who have been recording remotely. Potential to start with prerecorded shows, then transition to studio access.&nbsp;</li><li>Google form to document vaccinations for community members. Fully vaccinated do not have to mask inside. Only one in the studio at a time, with exception of co hosts. No guests. Bring your own headphones. No lingering. Wipe down equipment. No drop in studio use.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Bringing back board hours</li><li>Sarah updates<ul><li>All registered on wesnest</li><li>$300 in sales on merch store- working on transition with Mary</li><li>Potential to drop more archived designs. Demand for stickers. Promoting a shop on the instagram.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Mary updates<ul><li>Want a tote bag pic on the instagram! Make sure students know about the shop.</li></ul></li><li>Gabby updates<ul><li>Emailed about booking for record fair. Said to reach out again after July 4.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Leith Updates<ul><li>Regular board meeting- Tuesday at 5?</li><li>He will be maintaining the reservation calendar. He needs an email to add people to the GCal. Wants folks to send him emails to get onto the email. Are we only booking studio A or also B and C?&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Public Affairs<ul><li>Brainstorming someone who might be interested in filling the position. Make a pitch at the next staff meeting.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Next meeting<ul><li>Beginning of August and right before school. Sarah will send out a When2Meet.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Attendance: All present.</li><li>Pledge Drive<ul><li>We will meet goal</li></ul></li><li>Merch store<ul><li>5 sales</li><li>How do we comp Olivia? Potential for a discount code.&nbsp;</li><li>Debate over marketplace- some colors reserved, should it be exclusive to our station.&nbsp;</li><li>Should we link people to the shop tab on the WESU website or to the cafepress link? Move shop link to earlier on the website?</li><li>Link updated to wesufm.org/shop</li></ul></li><li>Clifton update<ul><li>Clifton back in action</li></ul></li><li>Station access<ul><li>Update on July 1, Ben working on proposal to reopen.

Alternating between A and B Studios for shows to minimize overlap. Some people pre recording, some staying automate hybrid. Could do a survey to evaluate preference?</li></ul></li><li>Fall Record Fair<ul><li>Reach out to Shelissa at SALD to speak about reserving Fayerweather/Beckham, potentially for 10/10.</li></ul></li><li>Summer programming<ul><li>Working out kinks.
