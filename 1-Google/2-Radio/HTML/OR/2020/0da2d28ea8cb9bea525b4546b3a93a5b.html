It was a transitional historic moment marked by protests, lawsuits and even sabotage that reshaped the Northwest timber industry and environmental policy and thrust the spotted owl into the national spotlight.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">It's been 30 years this June since the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/oregonfwo/articles.cfm?id=149489595" target=_blank>spotted owl was listed under the Endangered Species Act</a> and <a href="http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19900625,00.html" target=_blank>made the cover of Time magazine</a>.

They have been carved by some 30 million rainy winters.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Above the towering treetops, the summer air is sweltering, but in the dense understory, the soil is damp and cool.

Now, he hopes, they’ve returned.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Keeping track of nesting sites has been going on in this forest for decades, and McCafferty is excited to share this possibly active site with Eric Forsman, a U.S. Forest Service researcher emeritus, who helped pioneer the study of spotted owls, and Damon Lesmeister, Forsman’s successor, who leads the spotted owl work out of the Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station based on the campus of Oregon State University.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/65EHBVOL7FDUFDA5R5R4MFEKYA.jpg?auth=d48d76f7f66b68a04be445b83a6d6c7cd1a37c7a3991108dbcb68b4da862f4f9&amp;width=150" alt="Wildlife biologists Eric Forsman, left, and Damon Lesmeister represent two generations of spotted owl researchers." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:1920 / 1080;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>Wildlife biologists Eric Forsman, left, and Damon Lesmeister represent two generations of spotted owl researchers.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Todd Sonflieth / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Puckering his lips, Forsman makes a high-pitched sound like a mouse.

He points and whispers, "there.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">All of a sudden a spotted owl silently swoops in and lands on a branch above us.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“They just appear out of nowhere,” Lesmeister says. “And it takes you about one minute to develop a real passion for these birds.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“To me, they are kind of the spirit of the old forest,” Forsman says. “They’re this mysterious animal, and once I saw one, I was hooked.”</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">The curious bird</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Forsman saw a spotted owl for the first time more than 50 years ago.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the late 1960s, Forsman was a student at Oregon State University and had a summer job with the Forest Service. While at the Box Canyon Guard Station in the Willamette National Forest, Forsman heard an unusual sound — almost like an odd bark, he thought.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He had grown up on farmlands outside of Eugene so he was familiar with the sound of dogs barking in the country. He also knew the calls of barn owls and great horned owls. But this was a sound he hadn’t heard before.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Forsman knew that owls hoot to communicate with other owls — especially if another owl encroaches on their territory — so he tried to mimic the barking call.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">When a hoot came back in reply, Forsman got excited.</p><div class="audio-container article-body--padding article-body__media m_top-xs m_bottom-xs"><audio controls="" controlsList="nodownload" preload="metadata"><source src="https://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/31917543/31917543.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But he was surprised when suddenly the owl swooped to a nearby tree limb as if summoned.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The small brown owl with dappled spots did not seem afraid of him. If anything, it seemed curious to see who had come visit.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Forsman stared in amazement, and the owl stared back with large dark eyes. “They're actually kind of a real dark brown when you get close,” Forsman says, “but at any distance beyond a few feet they look black.”</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/spotted-owls-still-losing-ground-in-northwest-forests/">Spotted Owls Still Losing Ground In Northwest Forests</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Staring into the dark eyes of a spotted owl for the first time, Forsman was transfixed. “I wanted to learn more. I wanted to see more.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Forsman dedicated his graduate work to studying northern spotted owls. “At that point in time no one had done any work on them in Oregon,” Forsman says. “We didn’t know how they were distributed across the state, we didn’t know what type of nest they used, we didn’t really know what they ate. We didn’t know pretty much anything. So everything we learned was new.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Forsman searched the forests of western Oregon for spotted owls. He began to locate the owls and their nests and set up study sites from the California border to the Columbia River.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The more Forsman returned to his study sites, the more he began to see trees tagged with blue spray paint, marking an upcoming timber sale. “So it became apparent pretty early on,” he said, “that there might be a problem in terms of spotted owl habitat and logging not being exactly compatible.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">1973 was a watershed year for Forsman — metaphorically and literally. As he was doing his graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, he learned of timber sales slated within the city’s watershed. In addition to the municipal source of drinking water, Forsman knew the 10,000-acre forest was also home to spotted owls.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/IOP54E7YTFCEBNIMFOEQBVIJVQ.jpg?auth=485d799fb210d69dce8a117c0d2871a41379a591372020cb7fbe470f43736bdc&amp;width=150" alt="From a distance, the brown eyes of a spotted owl appear black.

He wore black smoke-jumper boots, forest-green wool whipcord pants and a T-shirt that showed a cartoon of a spotted owl and a little spotted owl standing in front of a statue of a logger. The caption read: “Look, Son, the woods used to be full of them.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Isn’t this great?” said Paul. “They just started selling them at the Zigzag store.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">I couldn’t tell if Paul wore it in solidarity with loggers. Or if he found it ironic to wear as a Forest Service owl counter.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Before heading out for our evening shift, we’d sit on the front steps of the 1930s cabin we lived in at the Zigzag Ranger Station, treating our leather boots with beeswax, waiting for dusk.

Some loads would have three or four giant logs — as wide across as out-stretched arms. Then, every once in a while, a truck would come down with a single massive log. It was a sight I’d previously seen only in old photos and postcards from the bonanza days of logging.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Driven by the post-war demand for new houses, and accelerated by advances in machinery, logging enjoyed decades of prosperity. In Oregon, the saying went, “timber was king.”</p><div data-oembed-type="youtube" class="flex justify_center m_vertical-xs article-body--padding"><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjf77CWZ4uk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But in the early 1980s, a national recession and a stalled housing market hit Oregon’s timber-dependent small towns especially hard. Many mills shut down and, in some of the coastal timber towns, unemployment rates swelled to 25%. As the decade wore on, so too did harvest levels, in what looked like a return to the boom decades.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">The race is on</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">By the late 1980s, between 3% and 7% of old-growth remained in the region’s 56.8 million acres of forest. In a mosaic of clear-cuts and second-growth timber, these remnants of the original forest contained the largest trees — clear, vertical grain that commanded top dollar — making them the most economically valuable acres. They were also the most ecologically valuable, conservationists countered. They began to challenge timber sales of old-growth in national forests.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/TCLWT424PFDXVJJM77I3BZKWBM.jpg?auth=a41ad102bfde9608cfcee26e6b56c13f3588b8039a2d9608ce14addc1de06455&amp;width=150" alt="An aerial view of steep hills shows some areas where trees have been logged and others where there is a dark green tree canopy." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:1920 / 1080;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>By the late 1980s, between 3% and 7% of old growth remained in the region’s 56.8 million acres of forest in a mosaic of clearcuts and second-growth timber.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Todd Sonflieth / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Logging crews would sometimes arrive on a site to find that protesters had pushed cars into a barricade and chained themselves to road-gates. The loggers would have to wait for the sheriff to be called, the chains to be cut and cars to be towed.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">As long as the timber sales followed the rules, the protesters had little legal standing. They looked to environmental laws.</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/old-growth-forests-songbird-refuge-climate-change/">Old-Growth Forests Can Provide Last Refuge For Declining Songbirds As Climate Changes</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The Endangered Species Act was seen as a potential means to their end, if a wildlife species could be found that both depended upon the old growth to survive, as well as met the qualifications to be considered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be threatened or endangered. Suddenly, attention turned to the northern spotted owl.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">As Forsman’s work had documented, the spotted owl lived in and depended upon old-growth forests for its habitat. If it could be documented that the reclusive bird’s populations had declined to a critical point to qualify for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, then getting the spotted owl listed could create the legal leverage to halt logging of old-growth.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The spotted owl became the unexpected symbol at the center of the Timber Wars. Protesters donned owl costumes and chanted “no more clear-cuts!” In turn, bumper stickers in mill towns read: “Save a logger, eat an owl.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In the national forests of the Northwest, the two critical questions became: where, exactly, are the spotted owls, and how many are there? Wildlife survey crews were quickly assembled and taught how to hoot.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">So I found myself starting my summer at the Zigzag Ranger Station, each evening waiting for dusk to begin our shift, watching logging trucks barrel down the road, freighted with the last load of the day — a sign that a blitz was on to get as many timber sales completed before things got shut down.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Into the spotlight</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">On June 23, 1990, the northern spotted owl was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/northwest-forest-plan-biodiversity-goals/">So Far, Northwest Forest Plan Falling Short Of Biodiversity Goals</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The next spring, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer issued an injunction, halting new timber sales on 24 million acres on 17 national forests in Oregon, Washington and Northern California, until a definitive plan could be made.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">In 1993, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and members of the cabinet held an unprecedented summit in Portland.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The resulting Northwest Forest Plan of 1994 significantly reduced the logging of old-growth forests on federal lands, but promised an ongoing harvest to sustain the timber-dependent economies of the region. Harvest levels dropped to between 15–25% of pre-1990 levels, according to the Oregon Department of Forestry.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">With 80% of the remaining old-growth preserved for habitat under the plan, biologists like Forsman hoped that populations of the spotted owls would stabilize and, with time, even begin to recover.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Arrival of an aggressor </h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">When I hooted for spotted owls in 1990, I had never heard of a barred owl. Yet, a few Forest Service crews reported sightings of this owl during their surveys that summer — which was odd.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Although larger in size, barred owls look fairly similar to spotted owls, with dark brown eyes and dappled feathers the color of bark. Rather than spots, their light coloring marks are like dashes, or bars, giving them their common name. They’re related to spotted owls (both from the genus Strix), but here's what was confusing to bird biologists: no one expected to see them in the forests of Oregon. They were native to the eastern side of North America.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I3T6XL52ENENTLV77BJPV4YNDQ.jpg?auth=4ae38cb4ebbe8bd310ba169e16876343649257df12b1d7bc1fa72d3763974aff&amp;width=150" alt="Barred owls from the east have moved in and taken over spotted owl habitat in the western forests of Oregon, and are now pushing spotted owls closer and closer to extinction." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:1920 / 1080;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>Barred owls from the east have moved in and taken over spotted owl habitat in the western forests of Oregon, and are now pushing spotted owls closer and closer to extinction.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Nick Fisher / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/article/how-barred-owls-win-the-fight-for-forest-and-food/">How Barred Owls Win The Fight For Forest and Food</a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Survey data revealed something else unexpected: barred owls had claimed approximately 2% of the spotted owls’ nesting sites.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">At first, biologists could only speculate on why barred owls came from the east to Oregon. “To anyone with any biological training, it was very concerning," Forsman said. “Biologists were talking among themselves, but didn’t know how it would play out."</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">But as the '90s progressed, the results started to be seen: barred owls swooped in and claimed prime spotted owl nest sites as their own, competed for food, and harassed, and even killed, the native spotted owls.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“By 2000, the level of impact was really marked,” Lesmeister says. By 2010, it had become clear: the biggest threat to spotted owls was the arrival of barred owls.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“When we first started doing spotted owl research, 50 years ago now, there were no barred owls in these forests,” says Forsman. “Now they're virtually everywhere.”</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Sounds of silence</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Three decades after my high school summer in Mount Hood National Forest, I once again find myself bouncing in a Forest Service vehicle down a narrow two-track road in search of spotted owls, but this time as a documentary producer for OPB.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">We’re in the Siuslaw National Forest, southwest of Corvallis.

It’s the single descending note of a barred owl.</p><h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray">Eavesdropping on the forest</h3><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Damon Lesmeister has taken up the work pioneered by Forsman. But the techniques that served the first generation of spotted owl researchers are becoming increasingly limited as spotted owl populations decline.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Locations that had once been consistent nesting sites are empty, and it takes crews longer to locate active sites. And researchers are increasingly sparing in using the very technique that was the first and most fundamental in studying spotted owls: calling.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">If a researcher calls, and a spotted owl hoots in response, it reveals its location — not only to the biologist, but potentially to a nearby barred owl.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">So Lesmeister has had to seek new methods.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">He’s exploring an emerging field called bioacoustics. His field researchers take portable digital audio recorders into the forest. For the past 50 years, spotted owl researchers used calling to locate owls, and would then hike to find, snare and band them, to identify individual birds — a “hands-on” technique common in wildlife biology, Lesmeister explains.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“But bioacoustics is essentially ‘hands-off’ — it’s a passive way to gather data and it minimizes our interference with the owls and our footprint in the forest,” he says. “It's sort of next-generation natural history.”</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">The recorders are set for four-hour blocks at dusk and dawn, collecting approximately 350 hours of audio at each study site. “It would be very unlikely for something that lives here that makes noise not to make a noise in that time,” says Leila Duchac, a graduate student researcher at Oregon State University as she straps a recorder to a tree with a bungee cord.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/GKAIJFMJWRDPLFTFII6MZJFO2M.jpg?auth=51e20655a2650d081caab4c7cb9884117b0e8a897799e3509cb8f07b27a644f2&amp;width=150" alt="“It would be very unlikely for something that lives here that makes noise not to make a noise in that time,” says Leila Duchac, a graduate student researcher at Oregon State University, about the use of digital recorders in the forest." class="width_full" style="aspect-ratio:1920 / 1080;width:100%"/></picture><figcaption class="background_lgray"><p>“It would be very unlikely for something that lives here that makes noise not to make a noise in that time,” says Leila Duchac, a graduate student researcher at Oregon State University, about the use of digital recorders in the forest.</p><p class="article-body__image-by color_dgray f_s_xxs m-none"><em>Todd Sonflieth / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Lesmeister's team can collect more data from the forest than ever before. In fact, it is the largest bioacoustics study occurring in the United States, he says. Since deploying their recorders in 2017, they have now gathered over a million hours of audio.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">If Lesmeister hired one of his graduate students to listen to the recordings in real-time, for eight hours a day, five days a week, they wouldn’t be able to get through them all in a lifetime. In fact, it’d take about 520 years — a lifespan closer to that of an old-growth Douglas fir.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">So they make use of the supercomputer at Oregon State University. Inside a room of humming server towers, the data gets crunched at lightning speed. The computer analyzes the sounds and suggests which ones might be the call of a spotted owl.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Back at the lab, research assistant Zach Ruff has to confirm which ones are indeed spotted owls.</p><p class="article-body__interstital article-body--padding f_primary m-none"><strong class="f_bold color_dgray">Related:</strong> <a href="/news/series/greetings-northwest/how-oregon-rivers-carried-millions-of-trees-into-production/">How Oregon Rivers Carried Millions Of Trees </a></p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“How many spotted owl confirmations do you have at this site?” asks Lesmeister, as he pulls a stool up next to Ruff.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">“Like a dozen,” says Ruff, and loads the next file to confirm.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">They are not just simply labeling spotted owl calls, but using the latest artificial intelligence technology.

Somewhat ironically, the computer mistakes the sound of logging for the sound of spotted owls.</p><p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none">Slowly but surely, the data processing becomes faster and more accurate.</p><figure class="article-body__image article-body__media f_primary color_black color_black article-body__image--full"><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MMDQIVSKXJC23JPVUDWI3QJNJI.jpg?auth=36e78b7d4aa30afe3bd0f6e59212e11fe95ccbd4794c82685c9508c62719e2bf&amp;width=150" alt="Using artificial-intelligence technology and Oregon State University&#x27;s super computer, Damon Lesmeister and research assistant Zach Ruff train their computer to process millions of forest noises and to interpret which are actually the calls of spotted owls.

Some of his adventures for “Oregon Field Guide” have included skiing around Crater Lake in winter, running the Wild and Scenic Rogue river in handmade wooden dories, and searching for sections of Oregon’s lost Skyline Trail.  <br><br> \nHis work has earned more than a dozen national awards, including several Emmys, and has toured internationally with film festivals like Banff.  <br><br> \nWhen not exploring stories for “Oregon Field Guide,” you can find Ian restoring historic cabins on Mount Hood or climbing one of the snowy Cascade volcanoes.
