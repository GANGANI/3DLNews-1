That’s a 770% increase from the 20 cases reported by that date in 2023. However, the 2024 numbers are roughly in line with those seen during similar time frames in the immediate pre-pandemic years, including 2019, when there were 93 cases, and 2018, which saw 248 cases.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Pertussis is cyclical, and before the COVID-19 pandemic – when restrictions that included masking requirements and school closures were in effect – pertussis peaked every three to five years. In 2012, 910 cases were reported, the highest annual count since 1953.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“Our concern is with how quickly we jumped to such a high number of pertussis cases, which tell us that the disease is doing what it does best: spreading fast and taking a greater toll on undervaccinated persons,” said Paul Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Public Health Division.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Among the nine counties with reported pertussis to date in 2024, Lane County leads with 64 cases, followed by Multnomah (41), Clackamas (33), Deschutes (15), Washington (13), and Jefferson (8). Three other counties have also seen cases. School-aged children and adolescents account for 92 (52%) of cases. Among them, only 51 (55%) are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccinations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Infants are at highest risk of pertussis-related complications and death, and they have the highest reported incidence rate. Between 2003 and 2023, infants accounted for 12% of cases and 76% of pertussis hospitalizations. And Oregon pertussis deaths have been limited to infants – five have occurred since 2003.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Babies too young to have been fully vaccinated are most likely to be hospitalized with pertussis. Cieslak said that pregnant people can protect their young babies by getting Tdap vaccine – which protects a person against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis – at 27–36 weeks’ gestation. The mothers will make antibodies and pass them to their babies across the placenta, protecting them from birth. Among 16 infant cases reported in Oregon to date in 2024, only one mother had a documented dose of Tdap during the pregnancy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When an infant or pregnant person is in the household of someone with pertussis, all household members should receive a course of antibiotics effective against \u003cem>Bordetella pertussis\u003c/em> – typically, a five-day course of azithromycin.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Vaccination against pertussis is routinely recommended for infants, children, adolescents and adults. Children should receive the DTaP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis at 2, 4, 6 and 15 to 18 months, and again at age 4 to kindergarten age.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>All persons ages 10 and older should receive a single dose of Tdap.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Source: Oregon Health Authority\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://1190kex.iheart.com/featured/portland-local-news/content/2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon/","cuser":"user/ldap/CCRPDX1BJN","enable_featured_widget":true,"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"featured_widget":{"country":"","id":"","kind":"","related_id":""},"feed_content_id":"","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"include_video_monetization":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":[],"primary_image":{"bucket":"new_assets","id":"%2F66560e8b8927c84846cb9fd1"},"primary_target":{"categories":["categories/local-news"],"distribution":["brands/Portland Local News","brands/KKCW-FM (871)","brands/KKRZ-FM (884)","brands/KKRZ-HD (15197)","brands/KPOJ-AM (674)","brands/KLTH-FM (11653)","brands/KFBW-FM (5269)","brands/KEX-AM (610)","brands/KXJM-FM (11645)"]},"publish_date":1717090200000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/Portland Local News","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon","social_title":"","summary":"The number of whooping cough cases in nine Oregon counties has increased significantly.","targets":[],"title":"Whooping Cough Cases Spike In Oregon","permalink":"https://1067theeagle.iheart.com/featured/portland-local-news/content/2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon/"},"slug":"2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon","summary":{"image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/66560e8b8927c84846cb9fd1","title":"Whooping Cough Cases Spike In Oregon","description":"The number of whooping cough cases in nine Oregon counties has increased significantly.","author":""},"pub_start":1717090200000,"pub_until":4115978604802,"pub_changed":1717090546303,"subscription":[{"tags":["categories/local-news","brands/Portland Local News","brands/KKCW-FM (871)","brands/KKRZ-FM (884)","brands/KKRZ-HD (15197)","brands/KPOJ-AM (674)","brands/KLTH-FM (11653)","brands/KFBW-FM (5269)","brands/KEX-AM (610)","brands/KXJM-FM (11645)"]}],"exclusion":[{"tags":[]}],"linksData":[]}},{"id":"%2F6658b3c67105032759f07c09","type":"PUBLISHING","record":{"ref_id":"%2F6658b3c67105032759f07c09","type":"content","payload":{"amp_enabled":true,"apple_news":null,"author":"","blocks":[{"attributes":{"mimetype":"image/png","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F6658b3ea7105032759f07c12","new_tab":false,"schedule":{},"source_credit":"","title":"","type":"asset","url":"","use_caption":false},{"html":"\u003cp>Oregonians can now purchase a voucher for a new, specialty Oregon State University license plate that features the university’s beaver logo and tree rings in the background.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The voucher is $40 and is available through the university \u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0lHeHGJtO4iJYcazQVkNnu7508k4TS2d4eE8oJ5E8ppYyazgoGO0L29-2B9eGxRTJv17YHieDYybCts90rjlFc4sPZ5QkDmYfsXvPPrxrDPx-2FRWXxYGeUhz4rv8r70yLrdA-3D-3DL-Y5_-2B20e2vhvthu2EMTw5tSq7GA-2Bez0lnsc1OCGJFQMp9XWXs2SUZb9QJBfFeyy75I8gdhdmQ-2BpNet1sA7BslE26-2BYBgf7SYKmf0z4O-2FCUh15RqvI-2BwlQTyds2AJID8eq6ycKVoCMxYYfYp7pQSZ6eCDCPm1d3j7xcm-2FgYeWoz8ez-2BiBU4lCRJUlW7mnYsSXpQwkcLr5eAylfMiRe4z7PoPzPkivKEbKQJjWLLFcq7ym2fvAR-2FfiVHHNablaqxCur87mOVyGzaJVRSRGTPiM-2BCTqwOxnWO7YwOySFOk8kCob9a9HbaUBsIsY5ES-2BTeHb0Ssfln75e5n0ZVsRtswCwmhyKQ-3D-3D&data=05%7C02%7Cnews%401190kex.com%7Ca8c9ac5881e240367ea308dc80b5ba01%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C638526765218773456%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=l5fr%2BpbMpKHt6IhUtufNXTCaxmIytGE%2BCrQxxUhG6HI%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">here\u003c/a>.

Her mom Penny Adkins, was only 18 when she was born and when she was only two, Adele’s father upped and left for Wales; he would never be in the picture as Adele grew up.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>From the age of 4, Adele began to sing at every opportunity she would get. When the Spice Girls emerged, young Adele would become obsessed with the Girl Powerful group. In 2016, she would tell Vogue, “People always think I joke about this, but the Spice Girls blew up when I was seven, and seeing them coming from a humble background — there was hope in it. It was really a massive part of my life when the whole Girl Power thing happened.”\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>When she was 11, her mum and stepdad moved her to West Norwood in south London, which she would immortalize in her 2007 hit “Hometown Glory.” It was there that Adele would fall in love with contemporary R&amp;B and the big, classic voices that would shape her voice in the years to come.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>“Hometown Glory,” was first released in October 2007 as a limited 7-inch on a small label called Pacemaker. The song didn’t do much until it was re-released the following year by XL. But the buzz was growing for Adele. As 2008 arrived, she became the youngest artist ever to win the BBC’s Sound of 2008 award, which is selected by music critics and industry figures searching for the UK’s most promising new music talent. She also took home the Critic’s Choice Award at the BRITs, which was given to the top rising star. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Soon after, Adele released her debut album, 19, on January 28, 2008. She named it 19 because, well, that’s how old she was when she recorded the album. It didn’t take long for critics and fans to fixate on her age, and how mature she sounded for someone who was only 19. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Adele was quickly popping up everywhere on both sides of the pond. 19 was on the shortlist of nominees for the coveted Mercury Prize, which is awarded for the best album released by a musical act from the United Kingdom or Ireland.”Hometown Glory” popped up all over TV, soundtracking huge dramatic scenes in countless TV shows like Grey’s Anatomy, So You Think You Can Dance, Coronation Street and 90210. But perhaps the greatest achievement, at least in Adele’s eyes, was one of her heroes, Beyoncé calling her “THE British singer,” separating her from the rest of the pack.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Her followup single “Chasing Pavements” earned Adele her first Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, beating out her former classmate Leona Lewis. It was also nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. Even bigger than that, Adele also won Best New Artist.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Now with a lot more pressure on her, Adele was ready to record her followup album Feeling the raw sting of a recent breakup, Adele reached out to Paul Epworth in October 2009 and immediately they headed into the studio. She brought him a ballad she had begun writing a couple years ago about a boy, which he felt needed to be stronger and more aggressive in its arrangement. With Epworth’s help they channeled the anger she felt from her recent split and used some guitar riffs he had previously written down.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>As the two worked together, Adele began to feel her heart race, which became the beat of the song. The two of them came up with the verses and the chords of the song in under 15 minutes, with the rest only taking about two hours.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>This is the true story of Adele's iconic song 'Rolling in the Deep' with newly unearthed footage from Adele herself!\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Also contains clips from: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_mj1CuXrPE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_mj1CuXrPE\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1wjMGosYa8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1wjMGosYa8\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp> \u003c/p>","startDate":1716462000000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvY2xpcHMvNDgwOWJjOGEtZTQxYS00MDVjLTkzZGEtYThjZjAxMWRmMmY0LzFjNDlmOGFmLTg1OTMtNGYwYS1hZDM0LWIwN2QwMTAyMGQ4ZS85YjdhMTZiOS1kYjdlLTRmYmMtODdiMy1iMTczMDBmNmVjNDEvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTcxNjMxODk0MiZzaXplPUxhcmdl"},{"id":176805848,"podcastId":124206648,"podcastSlug":"962-encore-the-stories-behind","title":"Going Back to Black: The True Story of Amy Winehouse's 'Rehab'","duration":1808,"isExplicit":false,"description":"\u003cp>As I’m sure you’re mostly aware of already - the lyrical content of Amy Winehouse's breakthrough single ‘Rehab’ is very much a true story. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Working with up-and-coming producer Mark Ronson in New York city, Amy inspired the entire production of the song simply walking down the street, telling Ronson her true ‘rehab’ story.

Well, great! Because I’m here to tell you all about how Kings Of Leon did just that.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Nathan, Caleb and Jared Followill were three good old southern boys from a small suburb about 17 miles east of Nashville, Tennessee. Their parents were Ivan, a Pentecostal church preacher and traveling evangelist, and Betty-Ann, who ran the church worship. At first the Followills traveled across the rural South in a purple Oldsmobile, attending all-night church meetings, tent revivals and healings. The family would be on the road for the better part of the year, making it hard for them to call any place home. But when Jared was born in 1986 they settled down just outside of Memphis until he was about six, and then went back on the road after Ivan began drinking and got into some trouble. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>The boys were home-schooled by their mom and given strict rules that prevented them from swimming with girls, playing competitive sports and even wearing shorts, which made water activities pretty awkward. Movies were also prohibited, the same with music other than what they heard in church. But church music was becoming a bigger part of their lives. Nathan would begin drumming on stage with a band during his father’s sermons, and Caleb followed as a singer, with hopes of becoming a pastor like his father.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>The relationship between their parents, however, was heavily strained due to Ivan’s heavy drinking, and in 1997 they split up, following his departure from the church. That seemed to change everything for their three sons.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>With their parents apart, the Followill brothers began to stray from their religious upbringing. Nathan and Caleb got into rock’n’roll, alcohol and weed, while Jared became a “little sh*t” with a BB gun, his brothers would tell Rolling Stone. Their cousin Matthew Followill, who lived in nearby Mississippi, was basically welcomed into the fold as an unofficial fourth brother.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Believe it or not, but Nathan and Caleb Followill were originally a country-singing duo called the Followill Brothers. They performed at open-mic nights and signed a publishing deal that helped support their weed-smoking habit. The guy that signed them, Ken Levitan, introduced the brothers to a  songwriter named Angelo Petraglia, and almost immediately he became an intrinsic part of their world, tutoring them on how to write a song.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>With some guidance from the younger ears of Jared and Matthew, Nathan and Caleb pivoted to rock’n’roll, writing a song called “California Waiting,” which secured them a record deal with RCA, the same label as the Strokes. There was one catch: the label wanted to put a band together for them. In a risky act of defiance, the Followills rejected the offer and instead they told the execs they would bring in their young brother and cousin and put together their own band. They told RCA to give them six weeks to put something together.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>And so in 1999 the two brothers recruited their younger sibling Jared, who was only 14 at the time, to play bass, an instrument he had never ever touched. At first he wasn’t happy with the instrument assignment, thinking bass was too uncool, but he decided to give it a shot.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>They also kidnapped their cousin Matthew from Mississippi, telling his mom that they’d bring him back after a week. Matthew had only taken two guitar lessons, and they had to buy him a guitar but just like they became a proper rock band. And for the next month, the Followills locked themselves in a basement, smoked a lot of weed and came up with some songs.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Of course, they still needed a name. Petraglia suggested going with one that leaned into their religious connections, like Kings Of Zion. While they turned that idea down they did come up with something close: Kings Of Leon.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>This is the story of Kings of Leon leading up to their all-time classic 'Use Somebody' with newly unearthed audio from the band themselves!\u003c/p>","startDate":1715252400000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvY2xpcHMvNDgwOWJjOGEtZTQxYS00MDVjLTkzZGEtYThjZjAxMWRmMmY0LzFjNDlmOGFmLTg1OTMtNGYwYS1hZDM0LWIwN2QwMTAyMGQ4ZS9kYjllNmU4OC0zMzk3LTRlODUtOGMyNy1iMTY1MDBlOGQ4YjAvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTcxNTAxNTkwMyZzaXplPUxhcmdl"},{"id":172787598,"podcastId":124206648,"podcastSlug":"962-encore-the-stories-behind","title":"It Was Only a Kiss!

And in 2011, Maroon 5 definitely knew what their fans wanted to hear.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>But it wasn’t always that way.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Have you ever heard of the ‘90s alt-rock band Kara’s Flowers? If you haven’t you’re not alone. They were one of the more forgettable bands of their time. Kara’s Flowers did catch the attention of Rob Cavallo, who you may remember as the guy who produced Green Day’s American Idiot. He saw a lot of potential in Kara’s Flowers and produced their second album, the power-pop-tinged The Fourth World. Upon its release in August 1997, the album only sold 5,000 copies.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>In 2001 Kara’s Flowers resumed band activity, changing up their sound by trying a number of different styles, including country and folk, before settling on becoming what they deemed \"a soul band, but with five white dudes.” They cut a demo for MCA Records, but the label rejected it. However, they did find an interested label in Octone Records, whose co-founder Ben Berkman had worked at Warner Music and knew of the band from their time with Reprise. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>In a 2004 interview with Hit Quarters, Berkman said he loved what he heard in a song called “Sunday Morning” but couldn’t believe it was the same band because they had such a completely different sound. It was clear to Berkman that the band was ready to take off. All they needed now was another guitarist and a brand new name.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Eventually the band decided on the name Maroon 5. Why “5” and not, say, Maroon Moon? Well, the answer remains to be a secret between band members… and Billy Joel. Wait, Billy Joel?\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Now with a record deal and a brand new name, Maroon 5 were a whole new band. Their first single, “Harder To Breathe” was a slow-mover on the charts, but eventually earned the band some airplay. Once it caught on the band decided to re-release the album one year later, and at the beginning of 2004 they issued a second single, “This Love,” a song influenced by Stevie Wonder and written about Jane moving out after the breakup. As you may already know, “This Love” became a smash hit, followed by “She Will Be Loved” and “Sunday Morning.” You know them all. And just like that Maroon 5 were now a household name.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Their second album \"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" was an instant hit - thanks to lead single “Makes Me Wonder,” which became the band’s first song to hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It actually broke a record by jumping from #64 to #1 based purely on its first week of iTunes sales. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Maroon 5 wanted a different experience when it came to making album number three. Luckily they received a phone call from Mutt Lange, the famous South African producer, who asked if he could make their next record with them. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Mutt has quite the résumé. He got his start in the late ‘70s, by producing both AC/DC’s Highway To Hell and Back In Black. From there he would produce classic records by Def Leppard, The Cars, Michael Bolton, and Canada’s own Bryan Adams.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Maroon 5 released their third album, Hands All Over, on September 2010. It would debut at #2 on Billboard’s album chart and receive mixed reviews, but got some love from Rolling Stone, which called it “the band's brightest-sounding and poppiest yet.” \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>The upbeat, funky pop on singles like “Misery” and “Give A Little More” demonstrated a punchier sound. Although the album sold well enough and kept them on the road, something was missing.Up until this point, Maroon 5 had only ever written songs themselves. They had never worked with anyone outside of their circle. But they felt it was time to open the door to other songwriters and see what could happen.Luckily for Maroon 5, two up-and-coming producers were working on a song that would become not just the year’s biggest hit, but the band’s biggest hit ever. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>This is the true story of Maroon 5's 'Moves' Like Jagger' ft.

She is the most successful female solo artist of all-time with more than 300 million records sold. In one word, she is Madonna. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>It is safe to say that without Madonna we wouldn’t have the likes of Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Dua Lipa, or insert the name of any up-and-coming pop star that interests you. One could argue that Madonna is the most influential icon of her generation. Emerging from New York City’s underground in the early ‘80s, it was as if a bomb went off in the world of pop music with her arrival. Almost immediately, Madonna would change music’s landscape with her music, while grabbing headlines with her controversial opinions, outfits and actions. \u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Madonna ended the ‘90s remaining one of the world’s biggest artists with perhaps her best album, Ray of Light, which flirted with electronic music and integrated the teachings of Kabbalah.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>As the ‘90s came to a close and gave way to the new millennium, Madonna would be the mother of two children and be married to English filmmaker Guy Ritchie. But that didn’t slow her down, she was still on top of the world.

Despite selling 4 million copies worldwide, American Life was the worst-performing album to that point of her career.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>For the first time in 20 years, Madonna was facing potential irrelevance.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>When Madonna began working on her next album, she needed to make a change. She reconnected with producer Mirwais, who had helped produce both American Life and her wildly successful 2000 album, Music. Looking to leave the serious tones of American Life behind her, the two recorded a few tracks together before Madonna realized it wasn’t heading in the direction she wanted. It wasn’t just about getting away from politics, Madonna wanted to do a complete 180 and have a good time. Like she did in the early days.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>In an interview with MTV, she said, \"I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest. I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy.\"\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Dance music was nothing new for Madonna. She holds the record for most number one songs on the U.S. Billboard Dance Club Songs chart with 50. But despite their excitement, dance music was experiencing a real slump in America. After undergoing a renaissance in the late ‘90s thanks to electronica, which Madonna was a part of - dance music and club culture had taken a bit of a nose dive when the mid-2000s arrived. Naturally, that didn’t faze Madonna. She was soaking up all different eras of dance music - '70s disco, '80s electro-pop, ‘90s electronica and present-day club anthems - and focusing on classics by Donna Summer, the Bee Gees, Kylie Minogue, Depeche Mode, Daft Punk, and of course, ABBA.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>This is the true story of Madonna's comeback Dance Single 'Hung Up' - with newly unearthed audio from Madonna Herself!\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Also contains audio from Madonna's 'Confessions on a Promo Tour', and the Making of 'Hung Up'.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6MCc8qMy7A\">Also contains audio from Sirius XM's 2009 Interview with ABBA for OutQ\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","startDate":1712833200000,"imageUrl":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvY2xpcHMvNDgwOWJjOGEtZTQxYS00MDVjLTkzZGEtYThjZjAxMWRmMmY0LzFjNDlmOGFmLTg1OTMtNGYwYS1hZDM0LWIwN2QwMTAyMGQ4ZS80NTk5MDczMC00MWY1LTRmZmMtYTMyOC1iMTRlMDBkZTk2MzAvaW1hZ2UuanBnP3Q9MTcxMjc1NTk2NyZzaXplPUxhcmdl"},{"id":164704512,"podcastId":124206648,"podcastSlug":"962-encore-the-stories-behind","title":"Don't Let It Get Away: The True Story of U2's 'Beautiful Day'","duration":1086,"isExplicit":false,"description":"\u003cp>Welcome to Season 3 of Encore!\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>When the Landmark Las Vegas sphere opened up in September of 2023, with its $2.3 Billion dollar price tag, its 300 tons of steel, 16K resolution screens, 1,600 speakers and 4D machines capable of pumping in wind, scent and more into the venue… There was never any doubt that there was only one band in the world capable of matching the Sphere’s fantastical ambitions… and that band was the Iconic U2.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Officially forming in 1976,U2 had an unbelievably successful run from around 1980 all the way through to about 1997, culminating with their first Best of Collection released in ‘98 with such classics as Pride (In The Name Of Love), New Year’s Day, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire, and many more.\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>Normally, in any band’s career - this would probably be enough - you’ve had the better part of 20 years on top, with critical and commercial success rivaling *literally* any artist that ever lived - it’s probably time to realize that your best days are behind you.

That’s a 770% increase from the 20 cases reported by that date in 2023. However, the 2024 numbers are roughly in line with those seen during similar time frames in the immediate pre-pandemic years, including 2019, when there were 93 cases, and 2018, which saw 248 cases.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Pertussis is cyclical, and before the COVID-19 pandemic – when restrictions that included masking requirements and school closures were in effect – pertussis peaked every three to five years. In 2012, 910 cases were reported, the highest annual count since 1953.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“Our concern is with how quickly we jumped to such a high number of pertussis cases, which tell us that the disease is doing what it does best: spreading fast and taking a greater toll on undervaccinated persons,” said Paul Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Public Health Division.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Among the nine counties with reported pertussis to date in 2024, Lane County leads with 64 cases, followed by Multnomah (41), Clackamas (33), Deschutes (15), Washington (13), and Jefferson (8). Three other counties have also seen cases. School-aged children and adolescents account for 92 (52%) of cases. Among them, only 51 (55%) are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccinations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Infants are at highest risk of pertussis-related complications and death, and they have the highest reported incidence rate. Between 2003 and 2023, infants accounted for 12% of cases and 76% of pertussis hospitalizations. And Oregon pertussis deaths have been limited to infants – five have occurred since 2003.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Babies too young to have been fully vaccinated are most likely to be hospitalized with pertussis. Cieslak said that pregnant people can protect their young babies by getting Tdap vaccine – which protects a person against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis – at 27–36 weeks’ gestation. The mothers will make antibodies and pass them to their babies across the placenta, protecting them from birth. Among 16 infant cases reported in Oregon to date in 2024, only one mother had a documented dose of Tdap during the pregnancy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When an infant or pregnant person is in the household of someone with pertussis, all household members should receive a course of antibiotics effective against \u003cem>Bordetella pertussis\u003c/em> – typically, a five-day course of azithromycin.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Vaccination against pertussis is routinely recommended for infants, children, adolescents and adults.

In 2012, 910 cases were reported, the highest annual count since 1953.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“Our concern is with how quickly we jumped to such a high number of pertussis cases, which tell us that the disease is doing what it does best: spreading fast and taking a greater toll on undervaccinated persons,” said Paul Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Public Health Division.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Among the nine counties with reported pertussis to date in 2024, Lane County leads with 64 cases, followed by Multnomah (41), Clackamas (33), Deschutes (15), Washington (13), and Jefferson (8). Three other counties have also seen cases. School-aged children and adolescents account for 92 (52%) of cases. Among them, only 51 (55%) are up to date with recommended pertussis vaccinations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Infants are at highest risk of pertussis-related complications and death, and they have the highest reported incidence rate. Between 2003 and 2023, infants accounted for 12% of cases and 76% of pertussis hospitalizations. And Oregon pertussis deaths have been limited to infants – five have occurred since 2003.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Babies too young to have been fully vaccinated are most likely to be hospitalized with pertussis. Cieslak said that pregnant people can protect their young babies by getting Tdap vaccine – which protects a person against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis – at 27–36 weeks’ gestation. The mothers will make antibodies and pass them to their babies across the placenta, protecting them from birth. Among 16 infant cases reported in Oregon to date in 2024, only one mother had a documented dose of Tdap during the pregnancy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When an infant or pregnant person is in the household of someone with pertussis, all household members should receive a course of antibiotics effective against \u003cem>Bordetella pertussis\u003c/em> – typically, a five-day course of azithromycin.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Vaccination against pertussis is routinely recommended for infants, children, adolescents and adults. Children should receive the DTaP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis at 2, 4, 6 and 15 to 18 months, and again at age 4 to kindergarten age.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>All persons ages 10 and older should receive a single dose of Tdap.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Source: Oregon Health Authority\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n","schedule":{},"type":"html"}],"canonical_url":"https://1190kex.iheart.com/featured/portland-local-news/content/2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon/","cuser":"user/ldap/CCRPDX1BJN","enable_featured_widget":true,"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"external_url":"","fb_allow_comments":true,"featured_widget":{"country":"","id":"","kind":"","related_id":""},"feed_content_id":"","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"","include_recommendations":true,"include_video_monetization":true,"is_sponsored":false,"keywords":[],"primary_image":{"bucket":"new_assets","id":"%2F66560e8b8927c84846cb9fd1"},"primary_target":{"categories":["categories/local-news"],"distribution":["brands/Portland Local News","brands/KKCW-FM (871)","brands/KKRZ-FM (884)","brands/KKRZ-HD (15197)","brands/KPOJ-AM (674)","brands/KLTH-FM (11653)","brands/KFBW-FM (5269)","brands/KEX-AM (610)","brands/KXJM-FM (11645)"]},"publish_date":1717090200000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/Portland Local News","seo_title":"","show_updated_timestamp":false,"simplereach_enabled":false,"slug":"2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon","social_title":"","summary":"The number of whooping cough cases in nine Oregon counties has increased significantly.","targets":[],"title":"Whooping Cough Cases Spike In Oregon","permalink":"https://1067theeagle.iheart.com/featured/portland-local-news/content/2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon/"},"slug":"2024-05-30-whooping-cough-cases-spike-in-oregon","summary":{"image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/66560e8b8927c84846cb9fd1","title":"Whooping Cough Cases Spike In Oregon","description":"The number of whooping cough cases in nine Oregon counties has increased significantly.","author":""},"pub_start":1717090200000,"pub_until":4115978604802,"pub_changed":1717090546303,"subscription":[{"tags":["categories/local-news","brands/Portland Local News","brands/KKCW-FM (871)","brands/KKRZ-FM (884)","brands/KKRZ-HD (15197)","brands/KPOJ-AM (674)","brands/KLTH-FM (11653)","brands/KFBW-FM (5269)","brands/KEX-AM (610)","brands/KXJM-FM (11645)"]}],"exclusion":[{"tags":[]}],"linksData":[]}},{"id":"%2F6658b3c67105032759f07c09","type":"PUBLISHING","record":{"ref_id":"%2F6658b3c67105032759f07c09","type":"content","payload":{"amp_enabled":true,"apple_news":null,"author":"","blocks":[{"attributes":{"mimetype":"image/png","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F6658b3ea7105032759f07c12","new_tab":false,"schedule":{},"source_credit":"","title":"","type":"asset","url":"","use_caption":false},{"html":"\u003cp>Oregonians can now purchase a voucher for a new, specialty Oregon State University license plate that features the university’s beaver logo and tree rings in the background.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The voucher is $40 and is available through the university \u003ca href=\"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0lHeHGJtO4iJYcazQVkNnu7508k4TS2d4eE8oJ5E8ppYyazgoGO0L29-2B9eGxRTJv17YHieDYybCts90rjlFc4sPZ5QkDmYfsXvPPrxrDPx-2FRWXxYGeUhz4rv8r70yLrdA-3D-3DL-Y5_-2B20e2vhvthu2EMTw5tSq7GA-2Bez0lnsc1OCGJFQMp9XWXs2SUZb9QJBfFeyy75I8gdhdmQ-2BpNet1sA7BslE26-2BYBgf7SYKmf0z4O-2FCUh15RqvI-2BwlQTyds2AJID8eq6ycKVoCMxYYfYp7pQSZ6eCDCPm1d3j7xcm-2FgYeWoz8ez-2BiBU4lCRJUlW7mnYsSXpQwkcLr5eAylfMiRe4z7PoPzPkivKEbKQJjWLLFcq7ym2fvAR-2FfiVHHNablaqxCur87mOVyGzaJVRSRGTPiM-2BCTqwOxnWO7YwOySFOk8kCob9a9HbaUBsIsY5ES-2BTeHb0Ssfln75e5n0ZVsRtswCwmhyKQ-3D-3D&data=05%7C02%7Cnews%401190kex.com%7Ca8c9ac5881e240367ea308dc80b5ba01%7C122a527e5b714eba878d9810b495b9e3%7C0%7C0%7C638526765218773456%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=l5fr%2BpbMpKHt6IhUtufNXTCaxmIytGE%2BCrQxxUhG6HI%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">here\u003c/a>.

That’s seven people per day during these 100 days. That is nearly half of the total number of those killed in teen-driver crashes for the entire rest of the year. And in 2022 alone, 790 people were killed in these types of crashes – a 10% increase over pre-pandemic 2019. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In Oregon, 81 people died in crashes involving teen drivers during the “100 deadliest days” in this 10-year period. This is an average of eight people dying each summer, compared to an average of 17 deaths in crashes involving teen drivers during the rest of the year in Oregon. This is nearly half of the total number of those killed in teen-driver crashes for the rest of the year in Oregon.

Teens are at greater risk of crashing because they just don’t have a lot of experience behind the wheel,” says Marie Dodds, public affairs director for AAA Oregon/Idaho. “Having friends in the car with a teen driver increases the crash risk, according to previous research done by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.”\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>“It’s important to note that people killed in these crashes are not always the teen driver, but it can be their passengers, drivers and passengers in other vehicles, bicyclists and/or pedestrians.
