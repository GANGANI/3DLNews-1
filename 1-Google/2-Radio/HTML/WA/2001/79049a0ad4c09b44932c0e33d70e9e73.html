<h2>IRON &amp; WINE</h2>

<h4><em>THE CREEK DRANK THE CRADLE</em>,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>You can’t talk about the boom of folk music in the 2000s without touching on Iron &amp; Wine. The project helmed by singer-songwriter Sam Beam became a standard bearer for the modern incarnation of the genre. On his first album under the moniker, <em>The Creek Drank The Cradle</em>, he exemplifies the scant and tender craftsmanship that would define much of his early work. The recordings were initially intended to be demos, recorded on a four-track recorder in Beam’s home. His intention was to pass them along to his friends in the band Calexico in hopes that they would perform as his rhythm section, but the demos proved to be an engrossing work in themselves and found their way into the Sub Pop catalog. - DH</p>

<h2>HOT HOT HEAT</h2>

<h4><em>MAKE UP THE BREAKDOWN</em>,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>Propelled by the success and jangly charisma of their single “Bandages,” Hot Hot Heat finally made their full-length debut with <em>Make Up The Breakdown</em>. Though it’d be a stretch to connect the Victoria act with the dance-punk scene brewing in New York, Hot Hot Heat’s music was undeniable in its flashy grooves and dance influences. It’s a far cry from their early hardcore days, but helped propel a new wave of indie rock that openly embraced pop aesthetics. <em>Pitchfork</em> included the debut on their <a target="“blank_”" href="“https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/5888-top-50-albums-of-2002/?page=4”">Top Albums of 2002</a>, with writer Rob Mitchum saying, “It might not have been fitting source material for DJs mixing at velvet-rope clubs, but it fit nicely into the playlist at every repression-shedding indie sock-hop this year.” - DH</p>

<h4><em>CALL YOUR BOYS/DEAREST FORSAKEN </em>7" Single,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>Well, welcome to Sub Pop, Iron and Wine! With this Sub Pop Singles Club release (Volume Two, #48, only 1300 copies), Sam Beam began his now-long-running relationship with the label. Like many unions, he eventually strayed to Warner Bros. and then Nonesuch, but let’s get back to the halcyon days of 2002. Back then, it was “Professor Beam” to you, as songwriting was something he did as a hobby when he wasn’t teaching film and cinematography at the University of Miami and Miami International University of Art &amp; Design. He had been writing songs for over seven years and recording them at home on a four-track (like these two songs here). He gave one of these demos to his friend Michael Bridwell, and — yes, you guessed it — he gave it to his brother Ben, who also happened to be in the Sub Pop band, the auto-correct-hatin’ Carissa’s Wierd (#SP0582). It wasn’t long before Poneman was making the call, and here we are. — JH</p>

The title track comes direct from their freshly-released Sub Pop sophomore LP <em>Find Your Home</em> (#SP0551), with the next three tracks previously unreleased at the time. Track 2 — (coincidentally?) titled "Take Two Kisses — was re-released for the band’s third LP, <em>Down for Whatever</em>, released in 2003 on RCA. — JH</p>

<h2>THE CATHETERS</h2>

<h4><em>3000 WAYS </em>UK EP,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>The <em>3000 Ways</em> EP was a UK only release, highlighting two tracks from their just-recently-released LP <em>Static Delusions and Stone-Still Days</em>: “Nothing” and, well, “3000 Ways,” natch. The track “On the Outside” appears to be exclusive to this release, but I didn’t dig too far into Google’ing “the catheters” and “on the outside,” for obvious reasons. The fourth and final track is a cover of a Gardener song (see #SP0454). — JH</p>

<h2>POSTAL SERVICE</h2>

<h4><em>GIVE UP</em>,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>The Postal Service are a band without a hometown. A collaborative effort between Death Cab For Cutie’s Ben Gibbard and Dntel producer Jimmy Tamborello, the duo’s first and only album <em>Give Up</em> was a runaway success. It was the first Sub Pop album since Nirvana’s <em>Bleach</em> to go platinum and their single “Such Great Heights” became a phenomenon all of its own. Gibbard and Tamborello didn’t do it alone either, bringing in Rilo Kiley’s Jenny Lewis and Tattle Tale’s Jen Wood to contribute vocals to numerous songs on the record. Gibbard’s Death Cab bandmate Chris Walla also plays piano on “Nothing Better.” The band briefly toured behind the record before putting the project on hiatus. The band reunited in 2013 to tour behind <em>Give Up</em>’s 10th anniversary. The band still has not announced any plans for a follow-up LP. - DH</p>

<h4><em>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK </em>EP,<em> </em><small><big>2002</big></small></h4>

<p>Formed in 1999 in Victoria, British Columbia, Hot Hot Heat began as a hardcore band, but by the time they got to Sub Pop, they’d morphed into a dance-punk thing, as was de rigueur at the time. They had released a single on the label earlier this year (see the confusingly catalog’ed #SP0410 and #SP0430), and continued to baby step towards a full-length with this 5-song EP. Half the tracks here were recorded by Death Cab for Cutie’s Chris Walla at Seattle’s own Hall of Justice. — JH</p>

<p><em>Make the Cowboy Robots Cry</em> was actually a moment of celebration: the 6-song EP marked the return of founding member, drummer Jimi Hey.

<p>Damon &amp; Naomi's 2002 album <em>Song of the Siren</em> captures a live performance from the duo in San Sebastian, Spain, during a period of collaboration with the venerable Japanese band Ghost. <em>Song of the Siren</em> acts as a fitting introduction to the band's world, mixing favorite tracks from past records with a few choice covers, including a rendition of the titular "Song of the Siren," originally by Tim Buckley. Ghost's Michio Kurihara accompanies the duo on guitar, adding additional layers to their breathtakingly spare arrangements. - MH</p>

After the band broke up in 2005, Mat Brooke, the band’s guitarist and vocalist, went on to form Band of Horses alongside Ben Bridwell. Carissa’s Wierd recorded primarily with Brown Records and Sad Robot Records — this Singles Club 7” release would be the only time Sub Pop and Carissa Wierd would pair up.

<p>"Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar" goes the opening refrain of this Sub Pop Singles Club entry — courtesy of eternally beloved songwriter John Darnielle — a relatively quiet (at least by Mountain Goats standards in this period), somewhat lovelorn ballad about the life not lived when you're wasting time spreading toast, living in Tampa, and waiting for an old lover to come back home. On the flipside is "Straight Six," which references the same Jenny character from the immortal <i>All Hail West Texas</i>, preceeded the classic "Store," a song about a vision of seeing a departed friend while being concussed or dead (depending on who you ask) in the middle of a grocery, fingertips wet with blood from touching their head wound. — MD</p>

<p>Tired of hauling heavy equipment around to venues, Scud Mountain Boys pivoted from their initial experimentation with electric rock when they formed in 1991 playing under the moniker Scuds to the unmistakable alt-country sound this Northampton, MA band would become known for. Scud Mountain Boys had almost a half-decade to master their sound, releasing their debut album <em>Pine Box</em> and their second album <em>Dance the Night Away</em>, both in 1995. The band signed with Sub Pop in 1996 and released the sparse, melancholic <em>Massachusetts</em> later that year. While Scud Mountain Boys ascended quickly, they would ultimately define their Sub Pop legacy with this album alone — the only other project the band worked on with the label before a 16 year long hiatus was the unreleased Spanish Comp. — SW</p>

This release, the third of seven releases the band would make on Sub Pop, captures the group’s brawly, venomous sound that catapulted them to success — and a sold out show at the Electric Ballroom in London playing alongside Mudhoney during their 2002 UK tour. — SW</p>

<h2>BEACHWOOD SPARKS</h2>

<h4><em>BY YOUR SIDE </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>Beachwood Sparks was formed of bassist Brent Rademaker (who grew up on Beachwood Street) and guitarist Brent Rademaker (from Sparks Street) while they were both in the LA indie-band Further.  In 2001, they released a single on Sub Pop covering Sade’s — yes, <em>that</em> Sade — “By Your Side.” It  also found its way on their first Sub Pop release <em>Once We Were Trees</em>. With its shimmering melodies and beautify harmonies, the song was a Laurel Canyon-esque (read country rock), mellow psychedelic tune that was later featured in the sountrack to the cult comedy <em>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em>. Really nice. — AL</p>

<h2>LOVE AS LAUGHTER</h2>

<h4><em>TEMPTATION ISLAND / LIVE </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>Sub Pop 576 is a 7” from Love As Laughter featuring “Temptation Island” backed with “Live”.  This 7” was 45 RPM on side A and 33 RPM on Side B.  Not sure why!  Love as Laughter was a solo project formed in 1994 by Lync vocalist and guitarist Sam Jayne.  The music is pure glam-punk with over the top guitars.  The music cranks along – imagine Led Zeppelin if they never left their parent’s garage.  The band went on to release 3 LPs on Sub Pop before signing with a major label, Epic, in 2008. — AL</p>

<h2>VARIOUS ARTISTS</h2>

<h4><em>GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT WE WANT</em><em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>In 2001, Sub Pop released a tribute album to the music of The Kinks by various Northwest artists.  <em>Give the People What They Want</em> featured a "who’s who" of Northwest punk and indie bands including Murder City Devils (see Pretty Girls Make Graves), Jon Auer of The Posies, Mark Lanegan (performing with Chris Cornell), and Mudhoney.  Young Fresh Fellows performed "Gotta Get The First Plane Home" while The Fastbacks recorded an irreverent version of “Waterloo Sunset”.  Most tribute albums are fairly rehashed originals but, in typical Sub Pop fashion, not this. This ain’t your grandma’s Kinks! — AL</p>

<h2>PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES</h2>

<h4><em>MORE SWEET SOUL / IF YOU HATE YOUR FRIENDS </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>On October 23, 2001, Sub Pop released a 7” single by Pretty Girls Make Graves featuring “More Sweet Soul” along with the B-side “If You Hate Your Friends” as part of their Sub Pop Singles Club.  This was the second club release and was pressed on split black and blue vinyl.  Named after The Smiths' song by the same name, this was Seattle’s Pretty Girls Make Graves only Sub Pop release as they went on to sign to Matador Records, releasing two full length LPs.  “More Sweet Soul” is a melodic, swirl of guitar energy with post-punk vocals from Andrea Zollo.  “If You Hate Your Friends” sears with self-destructive angst and later appeared on their first album <em>Good Health</em> which was not on Sub Pop. — AL</p>

<h2>J.MASCIS</h2>

<h4><em>LEAVING ON A JET PLANE / TOO HARD </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>John Denver’s “Leaving On A Jet Plane” has been covered by many artists including My Morning Jacket, Brandi Carlile, and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary.  In 2001, J Mascis absolutely killed it on a Sub Pop 7” single backed with “Too Hard”.   And I mean he killed it in a good way.  Released exclusively for the Sub Pop Singles Club, there are only 1300 copies pressed on yellow vinyl.   This will set your hair on fire as Mascis performs the song with his usual wall of guitar sound.  The B-Side “Too Hard” is outstanding, as well.  It’s an acoustic workout with his band The Fog that just sounds great. — AL</p>

<h2>DAMIEN JURADO</h2>

<h4><em>I BREAK CHAIRS</em><em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>Damien Jurado and David Bazan frequently come up together. If you mention one songwriter, odds are the conversation will eventually lead to the other. It’s not without reason either – Jurado even named <em>Ghost of David</em> after Bazan and the two have played on each other’s work. With <em>I Break Chairs</em> we hear one of their most extensive collaborations in their entire careers. Bazan stepped behind the boards for the record, helping guide Jurado away from the whispery folk of his previous records and helps him find him embrace the fiery tantrums of rock and roll. Sonically, the record feels akin to Bazan’s <em>Control</em>, which he released the same year with Pedro The Lion (even bringing <em>Control</em> producer Aaron Sprinkle to help mix Jurado’s album). Jurado has never sounded so brash and furious, shouting over blown out guitars and brilliantly loud drums. - DH</p>

<h2>DESTROYER</h2>

<h4><em>THE MUSIC LOVERS/THE SPIRIT OF GIVING </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>While I’m delighted to see Destroyer make it on to the Sub Pop discography — thanks to the Sub Pop Singles Club Vol 2 #41 — I gotta say, I’m a little dismayed to see the glorious mane of its founder Dan Bejar trapped beneath a trucker cap on the front cover. (Don’t worry; his hair gets top billing in the video for "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_VONrCJQE">Myriad Harbour</a>”, a track he wrote for his other project The New Pornographers.) Speaking of TNP, the Side B track on this single was re-released on the supergroup’s 2007 album <em>Challengers</em>, while the A Side was completely re-worked for Destroyer’s MIDI-orchestrated 2004 album <em>Your Blues</em>. — JH</p>

<h4><em>GOT THIS THING ON THE MOVE/WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>New Jersey post-hardcore act dips their toes into the classics with this Singles Club 7-inch. The band puts their own spin on Grand Funk Railroad’s "Got This Thing On The Move” and AC/DC’s “Whole Lotta Rosie.” Recorded with Steve Albini, the tracks are an appropriately noisy and brash homage to the originals. “Whole Lotta Rosie” in particular captures the rowdy charm that made AC/DC so iconic, reinterpreted with modern rock sneer. - DH</p>

<h4><em>SHINE A LIGHT, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>Just on the heels of an EP, Constantines released the <em>Shine a Light</em> full-length, which remains the band's most musically cohesive and powerful statement. Recorded on the heels of a successful tour, which led to the band being signed by Sub Pop, Constantines were at the height of their strength as a live band. In fact, most of the album was recorded live on tape, to capture the energy of the band's live set. Upon its release, <em>Shine a Light</em> garnered considerable critical acclaim, and was eventually named among Pitchfork's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. However, all the acclaim aside, <em>Shine a Light</em> remains a quite good album, demonstrating Constantines's ability to balance guitar power, emotional sentiment, and musical dynamics. - MH</p>

The LP finds the band continuing to mix elements of punk/glam/garage rock in a manner that could accompany a fight between two unpopular, Converse-clad youth. It exists as a fitting, if unsurprising addition to the early 2000s Sub Pop catalog. - MH</p>

<h2>RED HOUSE PAINTERS</h2>

<h4><em>OLD RAMON </em>2xLP<em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>After years in purgatory, Red House Painters were given the proper end they deserved with <em>Old Ramon</em>. The project fronted by Sun Kil Moon’s Mark Kozelek had a remarkable run throughout the 90s with their enchanting blend of slowcore and modern folk music. As the band readied to follow-up their classic LP <em>Songs for a Blue Guitar</em>, the band left their original label of 4AD and moved to Island subsidiary Supreme. The record that would become <em>Old Ramon</em> was completed in 1998, Island records was included in a historic merger that saw them absorbed into Def Jam Recordings– leaving Red House Painters without a label. The record went unreleased for three years before Kozelek bought back the album from Island/Def Jam and released it through Sub Pop.</p>

<p>By the time the album hit stores, the band was ready to call it quits. In those interim years between recordings <em>Old Ramon</em> and its release, Kozelek had kicked off his solo career with his AC/DC covers album <em>What’s Next To The Moon</em> and Sun Kil Moon was just around the corner. Still, it’s remarkable that <em>Old Ramon</em> saw a release at all and the music is befitting of a final album. While still hitting the hallmarks of previous Red House Painters work with its sprawling arrangements and introspective lyricism, there’s a brightness infused in this record unlike its predecessors. Kozelek opens the record with an ode to his cat (“Wop-A-Din-Din”) and delves into romantic reflections like “Cruiser.” It may have been the end of Red House Painters, but it was just the beginning of a new chapter in Kozelek’s career that’s continuing through today. - DH</p>

<p>This single spotlights the opening track on their self-titled debut (see #SP05610), paired with four non-album tracks, including the re-titled closing track “Goodnite.” Buddyhead.com described their debut LP as “songs about drugs and orgies made with only guitar, piano, and drums,” which is maybe more direct than the band would like. In an interview with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/stay-precious-6414777"><em>Phoenix New Times</em></a>, drummer David Clifford said, "We're not too concerned with people really getting it. That’s up to people's decisions. We certainly wouldn't want to be pretentious, or overanalyzing. We like having different layers that people can read into — not giving everything away and having a little mystery involved.” — JH</p>

<p>Pleasure Forever existed in several incarnations before the eventual release of their 2001 self-titled debut. Drawing equally from tropes of glam and shock rock (think: Marilyn Manson), the music on <em>Pleasure Forever</em> sounds both theatrical and funereal, not entirely unlike the emo revivalists that populated the early and mid-2000s. The band would receive more critical acclaim for their sophomore release <em>Alter</em>, also out on Sub Pop, but their debut does capture the group's spirit and dark intentions. - MH</p>

The six-song EP is relatively melodic and quite focused for the group, who had spent previous releases thriving on musical chaos. This focus does not detract from the power of the band's music, but instead hints at a musical progression to come. Murder City Devils reunited in 2006 and continue to perform today, releasing a new, self-released record in 2014. - MH</p>

Even the album title: <em>Alive?</em> To <em>Every</em> Smile? <em>Smiling?</em> The newfound joy could have plenty to do with his recruited bandmates on this release: guitarist/keyboardist Harvey Williams of Another Sunny Day, vocalist Beth Arzy of Aberdeen, bassist Keris Howard of Brighter, and drummer Jonathan Akerman. While Davies does return to lend backing vocals to two tracks on the album (<em>why, Bob, why?!</em>), it’s clear a tide has turned for Trembling Blue Stars. — JH</p>

They wanted to put out an album; it was pretty cool.” While Cross’s routine would eventually emerge on the Grammy-nominated 2xCD set <em>Shut Up You Fucking Baby</em> (#SP590), this film is more of a “making of” experience, following him as he performed in small “alternative clubs” across the country. Years later, the owner of one of those clubs ended up suing Cross for taping him without permission. In April 2006, the case against Cross was dismissed, leaving Sub Pop, Warner Music, WEA Corporation, and the Alternative Distribution Alliance to take care of it. In June of that year, they combined forces to make an “offer of judgment” of $30,000. Instead of accepting it, the club owner attempted to acquire $30,000 from <em>each</em> outlet. In the end, he received nothing, and the case was dismissed by July 2006. I feel like there’s a lesson in there somewhere. — JH</p>

<h4><em>SINCE WE'VE BECOME TRANSLUCENT, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>As the golden age of grunge sunsetted, Seattle's hometown juggernauts found their footing in alternative rock with albums like <em>Since We’ve Become Translucent</em>. Sub Pop themselves stated that their sixth studio album “is the sound of a band rebuilt and revived.” With cameos like The Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne on tracks like “Inside Job,” Mudhoney was back with a vengeance. Even though their first two albums were on Sub Pop, they went over eleven years, three albums worth, before returning to Sub Pop for one of their most mercurial music instincts.</p>

<p>With bands like The Ramones, The Stooges, and MC5 as their contemporaries, Deniz Tek and Robert Younger, founders of Radio Birdman, were hybridizing the spirit of 70s rock ‘n’ roll and the brio of punk rock. Until Sub Pop released their <em>The Essential Radio Birdman (1976-1978)</em>, the Australian blokes’ music was pretty hard to trace and track down. Having had many sonic renaissances and years dormant, they’re currently back together and were on tour just last year, which makes sense as they’re lauded as one of Australia’s staples in rock music. - ZF</p>

<p>2001’s <em>Find Your Home </em>was Vue’s sophomore album on Sub Pop. Before signing with Sub Pop for their debut album (see #SP0465), the San Francisco outfit went by The Audience then changed their name due to sharing the same name with a UK band. With their title track humming with harmonica, rock ‘n’ roll hedonism, and Rex John Shelverton’s steamy vocals, the group had officially evolved themselves from their pioneering screamo sound in the late 90s as the project Portraits of the Past. However, it was time for Shelverton, Jeremy Bringetto, and Matthew Bajda to blaze a new trail of raucous endeavors, which unfortunately only lasted from 2000 to 2004 until the trio formed Bellavista a few years later in 2007. - ZF</p>

<h4><em>OH, INVERTED WORLD</em><em>, </em><small><big>2001</big></small></h4>

<p>In 2001, Sub Pop released The Shins’ debut album <em>Oh, Inverted World</em>. It’s hard to imagine that ‘New Slang” (featured in several commercials and <em>Garden State</em>) and “Caring is Creepy” – their two indelible crowdpleasers from this opus – are seventeen years old. Originally formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after <em>Oh, Inverted World</em> was an overnight watershed, frontman James Mercer relocated to Portland. The Shins, and this album, played a pivotal role in sound of turn-of-the-century indie rock. It’s #61 on <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s 100 best albums of the 2000s and #115 on <em>Pitchfork</em>’s 200 best albums of the 2000s. - ZF</p>

<p>“You gotta hear this one song, it’ll change your life – I swear.”<br>
<br>
Even if <em>Garden State</em> came out three years after The Shins released “New Slang,” the iconic scene of Natalie Portman’s character Sam making Zach Braff’s Andrew Largeman listen to the song in a waiting room simultaneously introduced moviegoers across the world to the band. While the film’s become something of a meme itself these days, mocking a bygone burgeoning “indie era,” the soundtrack was an undeniable pop culture moment (and even managed to snag a Grammy). “New Slang” feels central to that. The Shins’ James Mercer has described the song as a “middle finger” to his own hometown of Albuquerque and the hyper masculinity he observed growing up – serendipitously paralleling the theme’s of Braff’s directorial debut. Upon hearing a cassette with the song years before the movie’s release, Sub Pop’s Jonathan Poneman agreed to release “New Slang” as a part of their Singles Club. The response was so positive that the label signed the band on for their first record, <em>Oh, Inverted World</em>. One song really changed James Mercer’s life. - DH</p>

<p>Sub Pop began to embrace the information age with their first digital single in 2001, featuring two songs from their recently released <em>Badlands</em> tribute compilation to Bruce Springsteen. The label picked a pretty killer way to storm their way into the Internet, showcasing two standout duets from Aimee Mann with Michael Penn and Damien Jurado with Rosie Thomas. Penn and Mann embrace the sparseness that defined The Boss' original "Reason To Believe," adding in the drone of an accordion and jangles of a mandolin to evoke a newfound dreaminess in the song. Seattle locals Jurado and Thomas team up for "Wages of Sin," with Thomas' refined, pristine vocals complementing Jurado's gruff drawl. The two sound so good together, in fact, that they'd collaborate numerous times over the years, performing backing vocals on each other's records. - DH</p>

The album is a departure from its predecessor, heading off further into space without losing the roots influences at the foundation of the band. They even manage to squeeze in a cover of Sade's "By Your Side," transforming the smoothness of the original with a haunting, harmonica laden ballad complete with ethemereal steel guitars. - DH</p>

<p>The fact that Spokane garage rock outfit The Makers shares their name with a brand of whiskey can't be incidental. But even if it is, it's too appropriate. The band sounds like a night with too many drinks and bad choices, slithering down the streets prowling for more mistakes to make. The band even traveled to gets in a Pontiac hearse, so you know they really weren't messing around. That darkness overflows on their single for "Tiger Of The Night," itself an anthem of those late evening street stalkings with plenty of smolder to go around. B-side "Miss Fay Regrets" sees the band rising from the depths to stop skulking and start partying. Whichever side of the coin you get with The Makers, you were sure to end up in some sort of sinister situation. - DH</p>

<p>While Beachwood Sparks were steadily building their prestige in the alt. country realm, the band's bassist Brent Rademaker and guitarist Christopher Gunst were stretching their indie rock muscles with their other band The Tyde. Brent's brother Darren Rademaker fronted the project, helping define it as more than just a "side-project" from Beachwood Sparks. On their 7-inch single for Sub Pop's Singles Club, the band shares two different covers from cult favorites from bygone eras. The Tyde puts an appropriately cinematic take on Scott Walker's "The World's Strongest Man," infusing it with a newfound gentleness courtesy of Darren Rademaker's wistful vocals. You can hear hints of the Beachwood Sparks' country leanings on The Tyde's cover of The Sea Urchins' "Sullen Eyes," with hints of slide guitar weaving in and out of the dreamy arrangement. - DH</p>

Both tracks are notably disorienting, oddly mechanical female backing vocals mixing with Dowd's menacing rasp. "Daddy's Girl" sounds like an outtake from the soundtrack to David Lynch's <em>Lost Highway</em>, blues motifs mixed with a surreal soundscape and Dowd's singular voice. - MH</p>

The single finds Kinski in relatively minimal form, albeit characteristically noisy. "Penthouse Suite" creates a discordant wall of noise, not unlike a rather musical dishwasher or construction site. "Please Remain Seated" is more melodic and quite texturally satisfying, gently whirring guitars placed against a tapped out drum beat. - MH</p>

Founder John Schmersal had previously been in the eclectic, groundbreaking group Brainiac before the group abruptly ended after their lead vocalist Tim Taylor was killed in a car accident. Schmersal began recording solo material before bringing in former Skeleton Key members Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon into the fold and dubbed themselves Enon. The group would really hit their stride with the addition of Toko Yasuda on bass and Matt Schultz replacing Calhoon on drums. Though rooted in indie rock, their sound readily embraced experimental electronic music and bubbled up into the sugar rush taht you hear on their Sub Pop Singles Club 7-inch. The band carried on through 2011, before calling it quits after a tour with Caribou. Afterwards Schmersal would join Caribou as a touring member and Yasuda would go on to perform with St. Vincent on the Digital Witness tour. - DH</p>

The songs are a farcry from the fastidious, furious anthems they were penning on their debut <em>Designing a Nervous Breakdown</em>, yet still exemplify the band's keen ability to turn any song into an emotional wreck regardless of the dynamics they're playing with. - DH</p>

<h2>ELECTRIC FRANKENSTEIN</h2>

<h4><em>THE PERFECT CRIME / NAIL IT DOWN! </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Like a monster crafted in a darkened laboratory by a mad scientist, Electric Frankenstein emerges as the ultimate punk alchemy, fusing their influences into something uniquely them. "Dead Boys meet AC/DC or Sex Pistols meet Led Zeppelin,” as guitarist Sal Canzonieri defined in an interview with <a target="_blank" href="https://ink19.com/2005/02/magazine/interviews/electric-frankenstein-2">Ink 19</a>. “We worked hard to listen to our songs and make sure that they were at a level comparable to our roots and that fans of these bands would love as well. As a fan of this style of music, if I felt I would buy the song myself, then the song was recorded. If not, out it went.” — JH</p>

<h2>LOVE AS LAUGHTER</h2>

<h4><em>SEA TO SHINING SEA, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p><em>Sea to Shining Sea</em>, the fourth full-length from Olympia’s Love as Laughter, opens with the track “Coast to Coast,” a song meant for arena rock, with frontman Sam Jayne doing windmills on stage and audience members pumping fists or doing the finger-figuration meant to represent “rock n’ roll.” In an interview with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scaruffi.com/interv/loveasla.html">Scaruffi.com</a>, Jayne declares the track “could become our manifesto.” He described the album (which had yet to come out when the interview happened) as "even more aggressive, anthemic… It will be a more focused album. <em>Destination</em> (#SP0490) is an eclectic album at its best, the next will be more homogeneous.” — JH</p>

<h2>ZEN GUERRILLA</h2>

<h4><em>SHADOWS ON THE SUN, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Delaware's Zen Guerilla might be the hardest rocking band to include a harmonica this side of Aerosmith. To poorly paraphrase a sketchy by David Wain's comedy trio <em>Stella</em>, Zen Guerilla is less <b><em>blues</em></b> rock and more blues <b><em>rock</em></b>. Their explosive sound of their fourth album <em>Shadows of the Sun</em> feels like it can be barely contained on the disc. With Sub Pop resident producer Jack Endino behind the boards, it's not really a surprise. <em>Shadows</em> would be the band's last album on Sub Pop and second to last release as a band before breaking up. - DH</p>

<h4><em>HEATHER DUBY &amp; ELEMENTAL</em><em>, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Sub Pop -- well, Northwest music in general -- is full of intertwined music projects like this. Back on her debut full-length <em>Post to Wire</em> (#SP0486), Duby collaborated with local musician Reggie Watts (yes, THAT Reggie Watts) and producer Steve Fisk. Heather and Reggie were previously in the band Clementine together, and when that ended, he formed the techno-soul project Maktub. Reggie and his Maktub bandmate Davis Martin then formed the improvisational, experimental project Elemental, along with fellow local luminaries Josh Warren (of FCS North), Skerik, and turntablist Skyler Gilmore (aka Diskyze). The whole thing circles back to Heather, Reggie, and Steve on this EP which takes the electro-pop hinted at on <em>Post to Wire</em> to new heights. — JH</p>

<h4><em>I WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR THIS DAY. I WILL BE GRATEFUL FOR EACH DAY TO COME / WHEN THE CURIOUS GIRL REALIZES SHE'S UNDER THE GLASS AGAIN </em>7" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Don't let the industrial, glitch production of this single's a-side fool your – this really is the same Bright Eyes who penned stripped-down classics like "First Day of My Life." Diehard fans of Bright Eyes aka Conor Oberst will know that he's long experimented with different styles throughout his different projects. The Nebraska songwriter is something of a genre chameleon and we get to see some of the first hints of that with Bright Eyes' Singles Club contribution. The long-winded "I Will Be Grateful For This Day. I Will Be Grateful for Each Day To Come" features drums programmed by Cursive and The Faint's Mike Mogis, giving Oberst the foundation for this surprisingly aggressive turn. B-side "When The Curious Girl Realizes She Is Under Glass Again" also appears on Bright Eyes' <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em> and highlights some of the tenderness that permeated Oberst's early work. - DH</p>

<p>The White Stripes were already gaining popularity in 2000, but they were just on the cusp of the fame and accolades that would have them being hailed as one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Between the releases of their seminal albums <em>De Stilj</em> and <em>White Blood Cells</em>, the iconic duo released a 7-inch for Sub Pop's Singles Club series taking on a hero of their own: Captain Beefhear. Jack and Meg White put their minimalist garage rock to the test and find success, reforming Beefhearts freakout classics into blown-out, sizzling modern rock scorchers. In retrospect, we should've known Jack White would become a guitar god with tone like this. - DH</p>

The remix version of this song on side B has a disruptive depth that, of course, warps the original song, but brings it into a different sonic dimension. And fun fact, Jimmy Tamborello (DJ Dntel) went on to be one of the lead members of The Postal Service. - ZF</p>

<p>Hailing from Madrid, Spain, these experimental post-rockers created cinematic soundscapes using moody and suave mannerisms. They spanned about ten years as a band (from 1996-2005) releasing a handful of quality studio albums that reinterpreted the sonic terrain of folk, rock, and Spanish traditional-tinged compositions. This release was another offering as part of Sub Pop’s Singles Club. Limited to 1300 copies on red vinyl, we get the campfire-crackley and mysteriously pretty “The North of Fire” on side A, but even more mysterious is trying to find a place to hear “Sad Corner Song” of side B anywhere on the internets. Gotta love a good obscure goose chase. - ZF</p>

After they released <em>Death Alley</em> – one of their most distinguished albums – Sub Pop pressed their songs “Jack Torrance,” “Let’s Go,” and “Evil Dead” on 7” records as part of Volume 2 of their subscription-based Singles Club.  You may have also recognized Zeke from being on several of the famous <em>Punk-o-Rama</em> compilations in the golden years of Warp Tour punk. The one minute and nine second track “Evil Dead” was featured on <em>Punk-o-Rama 5</em>. After laying dormant for eleven years the veterans have also just released their 2018 album called <em>Hellbender</em>. - ZF</p>

<p>Louisville, Kentucky hardcore punks The Hookers emerged on the scene in 1994 with their debut EP <em>Kiss My Fucking Ass</em>. Aside from clearly having a penchant for naming things, the group was notorious for churning out bombastic riffs with allusions to sex, Satan, and surreal fantasies – you know, family stuff. One their 7-inch single for Sub Pop, the group pays homage to some of the hard rock legends that came before them with covers of Deep Purple's "Highway Star" and Swedish heavy metal act Krokus' "Ready to Burn." - DH</p>

<p>Vancouver, B.C. punk revivalists The Black Halos weren’t lying when they named their sophomore album, <em>The Violent Years</em>. The blitzkrieg of the 12 tracks encapsulates what made the leather-clad Canadians such a vital part of PNW punk. Even as the world entered the new millennium, The Black Halos channeled a riotous spirit akin to the 1970s with larger than life guitar riffs and just a dash of glam rock to really make the music spark through your speakers. <em>The Violent Years</em> was the only album the band released on Sub Pop, but they would carry on and bounced between labels before calling it quits in 2008 after the release of their final album <em>We Are Not Alone</em>. - DH</p>

On their contribution to the Sub Pop Singles Club in 2000, we get a taste of the delightfully obtuse and magnetic art rock they were brewing up with a-side “Miss Spaceship.” On the b-side, they pay homage to another under appreciated art-rock act, covering Seattle’s own Sun City Girls’ “Radar 1941.” - DH</p>

Certainly not me, but here she is with The Creatures, a side project she formed with her spouse (and Banshees bandmate) at the time, Budgie, back in 1981. While Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees helped pioneer the post-punk goth sound, The Creatures experimented with tribal percussion, tropicália, jazz, and, well, there even seems to be a “show tunes” influence. Sadly, this was one of their few last releases. In 2007, Siouxsie revealed she and Budgie had divorced, ending not only their marriage, but their musical partnership. This single was part of the Sub Pop Singles Club V2 #27, 1300 copies pressed, all on black vinyl, obviously. We’ll just assume Stevie played Side A. — JH</p>

<p>In a way, this marks To Rococo Rot’s second appearance on the Sub Pop Count-Up having arranged some tracks on Saint Etienne’s <em>Sound of Water</em> (#SP509) and allowing them to record in their personal studio, Amber Sound, in Berlin, Germany. Formed by siblings Robert Lippok and Ronald Lippok in 1995 with then-Kreidler bassist Stefan Schneider, To Rococo Rot obviously find influence in their hometown genre of Krautrock, but, sound somehow, less cold and robotic. Sadly, the group disbanded in 2014. Robert Lippock graciously spoke of the break-up to <em>Boiler Room</em>: "We never want our reason to make music to be the economic situation: we never did that through all the years, and now of course we could have played the festivals and made remixes for people, but making money shouldn’t be the reason to be together if we didn’t all feel as we should about the music.” This was #25 in volume 2 of the Sub Pop Singles Club, limited edition 1300 copies pressed on purple marbled vinyl in an op-art embossed sleeve. — JH</p>

Formed in 1994 with a mission to keep rock n’ roll alive, their self-released self-titled debut album caught Sub Pop’s attention, and this 7” single was soon to follow. In an interview with <a target="_blank" href="http://exclaim.ca/music/article/black_halos-punk_preservationists">Exclaim.ca</a>, vocalist Billy Hopeless looks back on how they persevered in the early days. "It's like going to war. You have to survive with the band, and with your mental state. It's about the survival of everything. Like heritage buildings and heritage people, there's heritage music. We're just trying to keep what we believe in alive and that's pretty hard in this day and age. I look at our band after we play and I think, That was pretty crazy, we're beaten and bloody, and we've gone to war. The danger has always been there, but now it's just rearing its ugly head again. It's more of a punk thing than a rock 'n' roll thing because there are no boundaries." — JH</p>

<p>Zen Guerrilla take on The Who’s 1971 single "The Seeker” here, delivering a slightly more punk rock version — helped by Jack Endino's iconic production work, no doubt. Though the song itself is already pretty bad-ass blues-rock in its original form as belted out by Pete Townshend. The single was a smart marketing move to try and introduce the band to a new audience who would appreciate them. Side B is a non-album track for all you collectors out there. — JH</p>

You get the whole yo-yo aspect, as a toy, natch; a possible drug reference, maybe — but it also expressed the infighting going on within the group that eventually led to its implosion shortly after this got released. Which was a shame, since this debut full-length landed the UK punks some flattering comparisons to The Clash and The Ramones. In an interview with <a target="_blank" href="https://thesoulofaclown.com/interviews/tom-spencer-the-men-they-couldnt-hangthe-loyalties-etc-interview/"><em>The Soul of a Clown</em></a>, guitarist/co-founder Tom Spencer looks back at how they landed on Sub Pop in the first place: "I can’t remember the exact chain of events. They got to hear of us through various people. I do remember the gig they flew over to see us though. The Barfly in Camden (the old one) I got off the tube and met touts selling tickets for the gig, a good sign. The gig was a blinder, squashed down the front were the Subpop main men head banging away. They saw us at our best. We saved the worst for later.” — JH</p>

<h2>SAINT ETIENNE</h2>

<h4><em>THE SOUND OF WATER, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>By the time they reached their fifth full-length <em>Sound of Water</em>, UK trio Saint Etienne were a decade deep into their career. They had already begun experimenting with a more electronic sound on their EP <em>Places to Visit</em> (see #SP0466), and they continued down that atmospheric path on this release. It’s noteworthy that it’s one of the few albums where they didn’t work with producer Ian Catt, who had been a longtime collaborator. (Catt also works with another Sub Pop band, Trembling Blue Stars.) Instead the album was co-produced by touring keyboardist/producer Gerard Johnson, and included arrangements by Berlin-based ambient trio To Rococo Rot and Sean O’Hagan, frontman for the High Llamas. The result is something a bit more avant-garde than we’d come to expect from the band, while still retaining the retro-chic sophisticated-pop that made us fall in love all those years ago. — JH</p>

<h2>MICHAEL YONKERS</h2>

<h4><em>MICROMINIATURE LOVE, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Michael Yonkers is something of a Minneapolis musical myth. The experimental guitarist and songwriter was a groundbreaker in effects technique, reveling in noise and drone tones decades before we’d get to bands like Earth – though his preferred was the classic rock and garage of the 70s, the same era he released his first three albums. Yonkers recorded his seminal <em>Microminiature Love</em> prior to any of his other work in 1968 but the project was shelved by Sire Records. Eventually De Stilj Records found the album and put it out on a limited vinyl release, eventually leading to Sub Pop distributing the record as well. — DH</p>

<h2>DAMIEN JURADO</h2>

<h4><em>GHOST OF DAVID, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Damien Jurado finds a major artistic breakthrough with <em>Ghost of David</em>. The album maintains the sparseness of his previous releases, but Jurado's mastery over mood and atmosphere are at an all time best here. Quiet organs waver in the background of opener "Medication" like a downtrodden church processional. It sets the tone for a harrowing, bleak record coping with the tragedies of life, whether they be death or depression. The ghost in question from the title is David Bazan of Pedro The Lion, a close friend of Jurado's who briefly played in the band Coolidge together. Bazan also plays drums and piano on the song "Tonight I Will Retire." - DH</p>

<h2>GLUECIFER</h2>

<h4><em>GET THE HORN </em>10" Single<em>, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Gluecifer's <em>Get The Horn</em> EP doesn't tread any new ground – literally, all of these songs were available on previously releases from the band. Instead, think of it as a short and sweet sampler of everything the band does best. It can be hard to define a band in just a few songs, but the six tracks here paint the band as a hard partying, hard rocking, and hard as nail band who drink Whiskey in the morning. And, you know, that's a pretty good summation of everything this rockers from Norway were about. - DH</p>

<h2>THE RAPTURE</h2>

<h4><em>OUT OF THE RACES AND ONTO THE TRACKS, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>With the emergence of The Rapture, the dance punk era of indie rock was iminent. The New York-based group emerged in 1998, flipping post-punk on its head and embracing the grooves of dance music without losing the edge of the former. It didn't take long for The Rapture to become one of the faces of this growing movement. Their <em>Out of the Races and Onto The Tracks</em> leans a bit more on their punkier influences, but it helped establish the framework that they'd embelish on in the 2000s. LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy and Tim Goldsworth co-produced the album and would later sign The Rapture to their own label DFA Records, which would be instrumental in bringing dance punk to the forefront of the music industry – at least in the underground. - DH</p>

<h2>TREMBLING BLUE STARS</h2>

<h4><em>BROKEN BY WHISPERS, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Back in 1987, Trembling Blue Stars singer/songwriter Robert Wratten fronted The Field Mice, one of the cornerstones of the celebrated Sarah Records label, which itself is one of the paramount indie-pop labels of our time. He began dating his bandmate Annemari Davies... <em>aaaand</em>, the band broke up shortly thereafter. Wratten and Davies (along with Field Mice drummer Mark Dobson) went on to form the group Northern Picture Library... <em>aaaand</em> Wratten and Davies broke up. Enter Trembling Blue Stars, which began as a solo project for him to work out his heartache. A look at the track listing for this third full-length, <em>Broken By Whispers</em>, shows he still had some healing to do. (It probably didn’t help that his ex Annemari sang backup on the second TBS album and is even on the album cover.) Songs like "Sometimes I Still Feel the Bruise,” "I No Longer Know Anything,” and "She Just Couldn't Stay” reveal his inner torment. It’s important to note Davies does not lend her vocals to this release, so perhaps that bruise began to heal here. — JH</p>

<h2>BEACHWOOD SPARKS</h2>

<h4><em>BEACHWOOD SPARKS, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Country music has never sounded so freaky and colorful than in the hands of Beachwood Sparks. Maybe it's the fact that they were from sunny Los Angeles or a romanticized love of a bygone era. Whatever it is, the band's self-titled debut was a watershed moment for the act and was a payoff for Sub Pop's years of courting country acts in the late 90s. A Pitchfork review of the album by Judson Picco digs deep into the band's similarities to the works of Rob Schneider, a member of the Elephant 6 collective that also included Neutral Milk Hotel. And you can see why. The album is packed with obtuse, weird, pretty, and peculiar stories and vignettes that was beginning to find their way into the "quirky" new era of indie music in the early '00s. - DH</p>

<h2>MARK LANEGAN</h2>

<h4><em>FIELD SONGS, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>A review in <em>No Depression</em> characterizing Mark Lanegan's voice on <em>Field Songs</em> as, "sounding not only like he smokes cigarettes by the truckload, but eats the ashtrays too." And that's pretty spot on. Lanegan had demonstrated on his last four solo albums how much power his low, gravely voice contains, but <em>Field Songs</em> opens it up into new sonic territory with newly adopted influences from Middle Eastern music. He has some help building up this robust sound, including contributions from Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan, Queens of the Stoneage's Chris Goss, Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd, as well as a slew of other PNW legends. - DH</p>

<h2>DAMON &amp; NAOMI</h2>

<h4><em>WITH GHOST</em><em>, </em><small><big>2000</big></small></h4>

<p>Damon &amp; Naomi had previously recorded a song written by Ghost's Masaki Batoh on <em>Playback Singers</em>, now they found themselves in full on collaboration with the experimental Japanese outfit with their appropriately titled album <em>With Ghost</em>. Despite bringing in more collaborators than any other of the duo's releases, <em>With Ghost</em> surprisingly sticks to the minimalism of <em>Playback Singers</em>. Batoh worked dutily behind the boards, as well as adding acoustic guitar alongside his Ghost bandmates on electric guitar and keys. It's as seamless of a collaboration as you could hope for from any artist with Ghost fitting in perfectly into the Damon &amp; Naomi's haunting ballads. - DH</p>
