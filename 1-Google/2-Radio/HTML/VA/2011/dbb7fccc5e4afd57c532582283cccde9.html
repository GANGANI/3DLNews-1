__9:00 pm - 12:00 am__        
The original tagline oh so many years ago was: "It's like a podcast on the radio."  

And these days that rings true, as Don "The Don" Rastberger continues to bring weekly entertainment ("We waste your time so you don't have to!") programmed via machines, transported by digital carrier pigeons, transferring "the data" via "the Interwebz" (that series of tubez that the information flows through) all the way to WUVT's underpaid and overworked Trained Monkey Army, who take said "data" and give it to "The Robot," who tirelessly translates and communicates it into AUDIO MAGIC FOR YOUR EARS (we also play "crap"). 

Even live, we're never dead.  Using 5-D technology to astound and confound, it's "The Doncast."  Presented by The Big Waste of Time Global Chemical Corporate Empire and Theme Park Industrial Complex Consortium.  A subsidiary of Girls and Guns Telecom.

The best new and newish music on the planet Earth. Elevate your afternoon with what's good in WUVT's rotation and other tasty picks for the week. Everything from gentle to noisy and experimental to familiar all carefully curated and sequenced for your listening pleasure and only interrupted occasionally by the mindless ramblings of some guy who should probably stop trying to sound like he knows about music and get back to his IT degree.

__No Show__        
__5:00 - 7:00 pm__

__The Rare Groove__       
__9:00 pm - 12:00 am__

Inconsistency is my specialty, though if you ask me tomorrow I might say something else. I'll play everything from The Alan Parsons Project to Aqours. While I have no plan nor any direction I do have a penchant for improvisation, so come see where I end up.

__Rachel Mirsen__        
__3:30 - 5:00 pm__        
End your week on a good note! I'll be playing some new music, indie rock, folk pop, and whatever else I happen to be feeling. My mood is very influenced by the weather, so my show is sure to reflect whatever's going on outside:) I am always open to requests and suggestions!

I hope that the music I provide washes over you with a field of emotions, and allows you to open up your mind, and bring you to some form of euphoria. That being said, tune in, so you can tune out.
