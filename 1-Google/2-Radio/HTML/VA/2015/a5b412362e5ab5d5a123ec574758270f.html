<h1>Callie Lambert: How did you get started at WUVT and how long have you been involved?</h1>
<p><strong>Bryan Hunt:</strong> I started AM training in 2011, freshman year, when I came across WUVT at gobbler fest. Music has always been a major part of my life. I have been in band starting in 4th grade throughout high school and I knew I couldn't do college band because of the time commitment. So I was looking for things to indulge my passion for music, and I found it. I checked out their orgy. and it seemed like a lot of fun.</p>
<h1>CL: What was your first show like?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> My first AM show was sunday from 4-7am, was it hard? Well it required me to catch the last bus to campus which only ran at midnight, then had to wait for for 4 hours until my show, and after my show i fell asleep on the couch since buses wouldn't run until noon. And I never missed a single one. My second show was 9-11am on Sunday, so I had to stay overnight at a friend's dorm because I had to get to the station at 7am to plan my show and get my music.</p>
<h1>CL: What's your favorite part of WUVT?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Probably the freedom to play whatever I want really. I know I make jokes about how we have to expand or how it's sometimes restricting but in reality compared to other stations' I like the freedom. We get a lot of feedback and that allows me to explore my music tastes further. </p>
<h1>CL: Whats your most played artist?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> That's tough! I know the website will say Rush, but don't trust that because I did an artist showcase. My most played? Probably Elvis Presely, Joe Cocker, Wayne Cochran, and Journey. </p>
<h1>CL: I was going to guess you would say Journey! Do you know about the Woove?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> I do know of it but sadly I don't know much about it. I've never read much of it. (Laughs) They're going to hate me for that.</p>
<h1>CL: Since our vinyl collection is absurd, what is an album that no one else knows that we have in the station?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Oh! Stoney and Meatloaf. Meat Loaf is known for the Bat Out of Hell album. Songs like Paradise by Dashboard Light. Before all of that he was with a group that was signed to a label in Motown and I've played that a few times on my show.</p>
<h1>CL: You're always here hours before my show and you haven't missed a show yet. Is there any weather you wouldn't DJ in?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> (Laughs) Probably 5 feet of snow? I was here when we were supposed to have that hurricane too. I've never missed a show due to weather. </p>
<h1>CL: Is there anything else you want to say about WUVT?</h1>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> I've discovered so many artists since being apart of WUVT. It's allowed me to indulge my interest in music and I'm always learning about new bands. </p>
<p>Thanks Bryan!!!! Tune into his show, an eclectic mix of rock, soul, and R&amp;B on Saturdays, 5:30-7pm!</p>

        <h3>written by WUVT on <time datetime="2015-11-11T13:51:01+00:00" data-format="MMMM D, YYYY, HH:mm">November 11, 2015, 08:51</time></h3>

<p>Written by Woove contributing writer Julia Lattimer</p>
<p><img alt="kathleen_interview" src="/static/media/Screen_Shot_2015-11-11_at_1.44.21_PM.png" /></p>
<h1>Q: HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR SHOW?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> A smorgasbord of all types of music. Sometimes I have a theme for my show, but usually I just come in and smack things together that don’t really go together. But I guess that’s how I like it. </p>
<h1>Q: WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO WUVT?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I started working on the Woove my sophomore year, but I kind of dropped off of it because I got too busy. I decided to come back to WUVT, because I had a lot of friends in it. I also wanted a stronger sense of community with Virginia Tech, since I was pretty lacking in that. My first two years of college I didn’t have that many friends and the friends I did have I didn’t have a lot in common with. I feel like music is a great unifier so I figured I would find people here that I liked.</p>
<h1>Q: AND DID THAT WORK?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Yes, definitely. I’ve met so many awesome people and been to so many awesome shows that WUVT put on. I’m very thankful I found WUVT.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT’S THE BEST CONCERT YOU’VE EVER ATTENDED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Can I pick two? The first is the first time I saw Animal Collective. They became my favorite band that night. I had been sort of disconnected from music for a while. I went to see them on a whim and it was incredible. That’s part of what led me back to WUVT. The other was when I saw Run the Jewels last Fall. It was so hype and so awesome. There was a ton of energy and I would love to see them again.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT WAS THE FIRST CONCERT YOU REMEMBER ATTENDING?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Fall Out Boy. I was in 8th grade and I saw them in Raleigh, NC at a little 500-person venue and it was incredible. I met them all afterwards. Patrick Stump was really short but he was the nicest one.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT’S YOUR CREATIVE OUTLET?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I like to journal a lot. It’s kind of like keeping a diary but with sketches and stuff. It’s more creative than just logging about my day. I also think my show is a great creative outlet. It’s not my own art, but it’s a great way to create things that other people listen to.</p>
<h1>Q: WHO ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE ARTISTS THAT YOU DON’T PLAY ON THE AIR?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Danny Brown, Kanye West, A$AP Rocky, or anything with a lot of FCCs.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT SHOWS HAVE YOU BINGE WATCHED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> X-Files and 30 Rock. I love Dr. Leo Spaceman from 30 Rock.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT PLAYLISTS DO YOU HAVE ON YOUR PHONE OR LAPTOP?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I’m not really so much a playlist person, actually. But I’ll tell you I only keep four albums on my phone: “Depression Cherry” and “Thank Your Lucky Stars” by Beach House; “I’m Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams” by Diarrhea Planet; and “Manipulator” by Ty Segal. </p>
<h1>Q: HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR YOUR SHOWS, IF YOU DO?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Sometimes I’ll make a playlist for what I want to play, if I’m going for a certain genre—like sometimes I’ll go for shoegaze/post-punk/noise rock type of stuff. But if not I’ll just come in and pull things off the shelf.</p>
<h1>Q: DO YOU HAVE GO-TO ALBUMS OR ARTISTS?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I make a point to play Pavement every show. I also usually play Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine. </p>
<h1>Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY GUILTY PLEASURES?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I love One Direction. I think “Four” by One Direction is one of the best pop albums ever made. </p>
<h1>Q: WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE DRINK?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Two-Hearted Ale by Bell’s Brewing Company. It’s a really good IPA and I love 
++++++++++IPAs. I’m also a fan of Bourbon and Ginger Ale. </p>
<h1>Q: HOW HAS YOUR MUSIC TASTE EVOLVED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> When I was in middle school/early high school, I was very much into pop punk. Then it evolved into more angsty stuff like Bright Eyes and Sufjan Stevens—who I still like now. Since then I’ve expanded my horizons and explored new genres and new bands. If you asked me what my favorite band was ten years ago I would have said Green Day. Compare that to now, Animal Collective. </p>
<h1>Q: WHAT ARTISTS DO YOU THINK ARE THE MOST UNDERRATED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I think SHEER MAG is awesome and more people need to know about them. I also really love Nothing. They’re one of my favorite bands right now. They’re kind of new gaze/shoe gaze. Both are out of Philadelphia and some of my favorite and underrated bands.</p>
<h1>Q: WHO DO YOU THINK IS OVERRATED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> Tame Impala. I’m not totally dissing them, but I do think they’re overrated.</p>
<h1>Q: IS THERE ANY ALBUM THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD CREATED?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> “Feels” by Animal Collective, probably. They actually tuned that whole album on an out-of-tune piano, so it can literally never be replicated, since they don’t even know what tune it was in. I think that’s a really interesting approach to making an album. That album just turned ten-years-old, actually. All of my favorite albums are old.</p>
<h1>Q: DO YOU HAVE ANY PETS?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I have a cat named “Tango” and he has the most annoying meow in the world. But he’s super cute and I love him.</p>
<h1>Q: ARE THERE ANY COVERS YOU LIKE BETTER THAN THE ORGINALS?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I love “Hallelujah” by Jeff Buckley more than the Leonard Cohen original. I also love “Case of You” which is a James Blake cover of Joni Mitchell. </p>
<h1>Q: WHAT WOULD BE YOUR CHOICE FOR A PERSONALIZED LICENSE PLATE?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> I don’t have an original one, but I saw one online I thought was funny. It was a California plate that said “SHUGAZE”.</p>
<h1>Q: WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE GRAFFITI IN THE WUVT STUDIO?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> “BUSH MUST PAY. WHAT ABOUT OBAMA?” above the doorway. </p>
<h1>Q: WHAT’S THE BEST PHONE CALL YOU’VE EVER GOTTEN WHILE AT THE STUDIO?</h1>
<p><strong>KM:</strong> A couple weeks ago I was ending out my show, playing some nice, mellow, dead-rock stuff—some Real Estate and Nick Drake. Then this guy called in and said, “Is this the person who’s been playing the music I’ve been listening to for the last fifteen minutes?” And I said, “Yeah.” And he said, “I love you. I love you. Thank you.” </p>
<p>Kathleen’s show is from 2:30-4 pm every Saturday on 90.7 WUVT FM Blacksburg.</p>

<h1>Dark and Delicious</h1>
<h4>A Brief Introductory Interview with Nathaniel Bogan and Shanice Trimboli</h4>
<h3>Written by Woove contributor Mary Desmond</h3>
<p>When you want to find “punx” with “good taste in things” you go to WUVT. I had the pleasure of talking to Shanice Trimboli and Nathaniel Bogan about everything from Poptarts, to metal music; to Amelia Earhart, bassoons and Donald Trump. Let’s delve into the inner machinations of these two renegades’ minds, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What brought you to WUVT?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – I wanted to find some punx.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – A couple kids I went to high school with had shows so when I got to college they said, “Hey Shanice, you have good taste in things, do this” And I did. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What is your favorite Poptart and how does that flavor speak to your soul?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – I’m vegan and Poptarts aren’t really my team…<br />
<strong>S</strong> – I used to eat wildberry ones with the blue and purple stripes as a kid, but Poptarts are pretty gross and sticky, much like my soul. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What music do you play on your show?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – We play a lot of loud punk/metal/stoner and other stuff.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – I guess some punk and stuff that has guitarsz and noises, it’s good and I don’t know how to describe it.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – You have to sleep with one, marry one, and kill one…. Donald Trump, Earl Dibble’s Jr., and the Pope<br />
<strong>N</strong> – Kill them all. I make the rules.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – Kill Donald Trump. “Sleep with” Earl Dibbles Jr but like in the “screw you” sense of it. Marry the Pope for scandal (I was raised Muslim)</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What sorts of fun things do you guys do while hosting together?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – High five and drink cokes, duh.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – Sometimes I make weird faces at Nathaniel’s back of the head when he’s talking in the hopes that he will peep it and mess up on air. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What’s your favorite musical moment?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – Probably when my doom band played a metal block party on tour. There’s footage if you’re interested.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – In the sixth grade, we had to pick instruments for band. I broke my back a year prior so I couldn’t pick up the bassoon like I wanted to. I had to go with some small light-weight wimpy thing. SO, I went to try out the flute and the lady with the flutes said to me, you r lips are not a good shape for this instrument. And that’s when I decided to listen to metals and guitars. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What sorts of playlists do you have on your phone/laptop/anything?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – I’m more of an album-front-to-back kinda guy, but I have a playlist called “soul crusher.”<br />
<strong>S</strong> - I made this amazing shower playlist.I stole the idea from an old friend. It’s a good thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What are your thoughts on the disappearance of Amelia Earhart?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – It was a conspiracy. It was too early in American history for a woman to get any street cred for something so cool.<br />
<strong>S</strong> - Sucks, I wish I could have met her seems cool. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – What is your favorite concert experience?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – I can’t decide on just one, but it would have to be either: black Sabbath, dillinger 4, or the first time I saw sleep in Philly.<br />
<strong>S</strong> - When I was a small child I held a concert in my living room on a tiny plastic toy grand piano and I played the same song that I had written for 30 minutes at least and my parents left the room after the first 2 times through but I just kept playing louder and louder. </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> – Any other coolness factor you have to contribute to this silly introductory interview?<br />
<strong>N</strong> – I love pop music. I bought a nicki minaj shirt the other day so keep your eyes peeled for that.<br />
<strong>S</strong> – I’m terrible. Don’t be fooled. </p>
<p>There’s something kind of dark and delicious about these two that will bring me back to the studio to talk to them again very soon. I look forward to the head banging and high-fiving that will ensue. That’s it for now, folks.</p>
