By: Dwayne Page</span></p><p>A man fatally shot on Halloween by his step-father. The resurgence of a local military garment factory that was about to go down the tubes. Bids awarded for the long awaited new Highway 56 south project. The Board of Education’s expanded plan for new schools. A hefty increase in the county and City of Smithville property tax rates. And in sports, a return to the state basketball tournament after 54 years for the DCHS Lady Tigers as well as an historic state playoff run for the DCHS Tiger football team and a seventh place finish in the state large high golf tournament for DCHS Senior Anna Chew. These rank among the top local news and sports stories of 2019 in DeKalb County.</p><p>*37 year old Tyler Durden, a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army, lost his life after being shot in the chest at a home in Liberty on Halloween night. The man responsible for the shooting is his step father, 50 year old Albert Wayne Fisher, Jr. of Eckles Heights Street, Liberty. Fisher was arrested and charged with 2nd degree murder. The case was investigated by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the 13th District Attorney General’s Office and the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department. During the course of the probe, agents developed information that Durden approached the residence of his mother and stepfather and Fisher came to the door. During that encounter, Fisher fired a weapon, striking Durden. The victim was ultimately transported to a Nashville hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. Investigators have not disclosed a motive for the shooting or the circumstances surrounding it.</p><p>*Omega Apparel Incorporated was once a thriving garment factory in Smithville and the new company that has succeeded it hopes to make the industry flourish again. 620 Pelham, Inc. began operations this fall in both buildings near downtown where Omega Apparel operated until deciding to go out of business after experiencing hard times. The factory still produces Broadfall trousers for the US Navy although that contract is ending after the first of the year and it supplies three Goretex garments including pants and parkas under a sub-contract for the east Tennessee based Valley Apparel, LLC. In a November meeting, plant manager Amanda Callis and consultant Dick Chase, a former owner of Omega during its glory days, brought employees up to date on plans for the new industry. Chase also spoke with the local media afterwards. With employment currently at just over 100, Chase said the factory plans to expand its commercial work and land more government contracts from the defense department for the US military and to eventually employ up to perhaps another 150 people. Hiring has already begun and anyone interested in a job can apply in person at the factory office on South Mountain Street. The California based company which owns 620 Pelham recently signed a two year lease including renewal options with the county industrial development board and the City of Smithville which owns the buildings where the factory operates.

TDOT opened bids in June and Jones Brothers Contractors, LLC was the low bidder on the construction project at $43,691,948 which will be done in two phases from south of state highway 288 near Magness Road to East Bryant Street in Smithville and from south of the Warren-DeKalb County line to near Magness Road in DeKalb County. A proposed third segment from near State Route 287 in Warren County to near the DeKalb County line is not yet ready for bid letting. The state plans to build largely two lanes of a proposed four lane project and maintain traffic on the existing Highway 56 (alignment) while construction is being done on the new portion. The estimated completion date for the two phases is May 31, 2022.</p><p>*Fourteen months ago the Board of Education was sold on building a new pre-kindergarten to 2nd grade school to replace Smithville Elementary School and voted in October, 2018 to seek funding from the county commission for this building model once a suitable site was found. In March the school board got its first look at the schematic design, site plan, and floor plan for the proposed new Smithville Elementary School. Architects of Upland Design Group met with the board to review four site plan options for a new 109,000 square foot school with a student capacity of 800 for pre-kindergarten to second grade. All four options were laid out for new school construction on the same campus as Northside Elementary School. Six months later in September the school board considered four other locations for the possible future home of the new elementary school after advertising for property owners to answer a “Request for Proposal” if they were willing to sell from 25 to 100 acres. Four proposals were submitted for consideration. But by December, the school board had a change of heart. During a special meeting the Board voted 6-1 to scrap the plan for a Pre-K to 2nd grade school and recommend to the county commission funding two new Pre-K through 8th grade schools in the Smithville area and a renovation of Northside Elementary School to make it a Pre-K to 8th grade facility. That would give the district a total of four Pre-K to 8th grade schools including DeKalb West while eliminating both the existing Smithville Elementary and DeKalb Middle Schools. Without any hard numbers, the board is relying on its architects’ latest estimates for construction which puts the new 2 school project at a minimum of $48,685,000 (not counting the total renovation which would be needed at Northside Elementary) and it does not include the purchase of land. The proposal now moves to the county commission for discussion.</p><p>*In order to keep the county government from going deeper in the red and to fund past obligations for pay raises and to create new positions, the DeKalb County Commission in July voted to increase county property tax rates which went into effect October 1. By the slimmest of margins, the commission voted 8 to 6 to raise the county property tax rate by 29 cents per $100 of assessed value as recommended by the budget committee. The new rate, with passage of the 2019-20 fiscal year budget, went to $2.12, up from $1.83 per $100 of assessed value. Highlights of new spending in the 2019-20 consolidated budget are as follows: Board of Education: The school board funded a local pay raise for the district’s 225 teachers by $1,200 each and that coupled with a state raise of $800 per teacher put their overall increase at $2,000 for the ensuing year. The 200 non-certified staff members each got a $600 local pay raise. Circuit Court Clerk: New deputy clerk position funded. Sheriff’s Department and Jail: Two new officer positions funded solely from a new litigation tax through the General Sessions Court budget. One other new deputy position created and funded by the county through the sheriff’s department budget. And while no new positions were added to the jail budget, the sheriff plans to promote two existing correctional officers to the rank of corporal as jail supervisors. Each one will get a $2,000 increase in pay under the existing wage scale for sheriff’s department employees for a total of $4,000. The move keeps the sheriff’s department compliant with standards for around the clock jail supervision under standards of the Tennessee Corrections Institute. DeKalb Fire Department: Two shared firefighter positions funded at 20 hours each per week at $10 per hour for a total of $20,800. No two specific individuals will get the jobs. Available firefighters, who are trained and certified, will rotate in and out of the positions as needed. The two fire fighters will be assigned to work out of the main station on King Ridge Road, which serves as the hub of the county fire department. DeKalb Emergency Management Agency: Funding to pay the EMA Director Charlie Parker a salary of $5,200 for the new year. Clerk &amp; Master: Funding of $10,400 for a part time employee. Alexandria Senior Citizens: Funding to pay the salary of a full time director of the center at $21,291 as a first year employee plus benefits for a total budget impact to the county of $28,051.DeKalb EMS: Funding for director pay raise of $3,000. Smithville-DeKalb County Rescue Squad: The Rescue Squad asked the county to up its contribution from $22, 821 to $34, 821 with the proposed $12,000 increase to be allocated for fuel reimbursement to its member volunteers to recoup some of their personal expense. The budget funded only an increase of $3,279.</p><p>*For the first time in decades, Smithville property tax payers saw a significant tax increase. By a vote of 3-2, the aldermen voted twice in June on separate ordinance readings to increase the city property tax rate by 25 cents per $100 of assessed value and to adopt the new $6.8 million budget for the 2019-20 fiscal year. Aldermen Danny Washer, Shawn Jacobs, and Gayla Hendrix voted in favor. Aldermen Brandon Cox and Donnie Crook voted against it. The 25 cent tax rate increase from the former rate of 64.9 cents to the new rate of 89.9 cents per $100 of assessed value is expected to generate $350,000 in new money for the general fund. The largest project on the table in the general fund is a new police department building. The proposed 7,805 square foot structure is to be built on property donated to the city on the north side of the city hall/fire department complex at Don Cantrell Street. The cost of the new facility could be as much as two million dollars to be funded either on a long term note or bond issue. From the start date of construction, projections are the building could be completed possibly within one year. The mayor and aldermen earlier met with Wayne Oakley of Studio Oakley Architects, LLC who submitted a bid to design the new police department building for the city at $105,000 and that cost was included in the new budget as engineering fees. A 2% pay raise was also figured into the budget for city employees who have topped out on the wage scale and funds for employee disability insurance coverage to help protect city employees from loss of income in the event they are unable to work for a period of time due to illness, injury, or accident while off the job. Capital outlay expenditures totaled $622,100 much of which includes grants for airport easements and clearing and a grant match for sidewalk improvements. Plans are to purchase two used police cars and a 16 foot flat bed trailer for the fire department. Capital outlay expenses for the water and sewer department include the purchase of a Kubota trackhoe, trailer, diesel truck, 9 foot dump body, camera system for leak detection, and engineering fees and sewer rehab project construction costs. The city has applied for a $500,000 Community Development Block Grant to help fund the sewer rehab project.</p><p>*Not since 1965 had DCHS sent a girls team to the state’s big dance, but that long dry spell ended in March when the Lady Tigers of Coach Danny Fish punched their ticket to the state tournament at MTSU after knocking off McMinn Central in the sub-state.

Mayor Josh Miller asked Vickers to attend the meeting after being confronted by citizens who had questions about the facilities that the mayor could not answer. Vickers said he is a believer in the Sober Living Services because he has seen it change lives of people addicted to drugs and alcohol including his own. Since he started the programs here in 2011, Vickers said many have been served. “We have seen approximately 2,000 people. I’ve got six Sober Living homes and one of them has three apartments in it. I own probably 30 total rentals. We have about fifty to sixty people at a time (from outside DeKalb County). They come from different places including treatment centers, and hospitals. We have homeless veterans and some come from jails. We don’t take sex offenders or anybody with an aggravated (violent crime) charge. You must have an alcohol or drug problem to get in our program and just anybody can’t come,”said Vickers. All are subject to house rules and curfews and those who are on probation or parole are monitored closely. Probation and parole officers check on them several times a week and we send progress reports to each probation or parole officer, or whoever is over that person each month. They are also drug tested randomly the whole time they are here. If they fail a drug test they can be discharged but we try to get them to go to a treatment center,” Vickers continued. “For the first 90 days the participants are not allowed to go anywhere by themselves. They must have someone walking with them. If they walk to the store, wherever they go they must have somebody with them,” he said. While transportation is provided in some cases, Vickers explained that it is difficult to keep the participants from walking about town, especially if they have jobs.

According to District Attorney General Bryant Dunaway, 28 year old Jessica Whitworth Stephens of Woodbury was the victim of an accidental death caused by a combination of drug toxicity and hypothermia.  Investigators looked into the circumstances of her death and what we have been waiting for as the missing piece of the investigation is the report of the medical examiner. The autopsy report. We just recently received that back and the medical examiner’s office has determined that the cause of death is the combination of the presence of drugs in her system as well as hypothermia. It was a rainy and cold night when she was found and she was found outdoors exposed to the elements so the manner of death ruled by the medical examiner is an accident so there will be no further investigation on our part. There appears to be no crime. It’s just an accidental death caused by a combination of drug toxicity and hypothermia,” said Dunaway in a statement to WJLE. Stephens’ body was found on Monday, November 12, 2018 in a backyard on Parkway Drive near Federal Mogul. Through fingerprints, investigators were able to identify her.

Architects of Upland Design Group met with the board and director during an hour long presentation of the plans they have developed. Four site plan options were presented for the proposed 109,000 square foot school with a student capacity of 800 for pre-kindergarten to second grade. All four options would have the new school on the same campus as Northside Elementary School. The first site plan option proposed to fit the new school on the existing property with no additional land acquisition necessary. However, the architects said this option posed challenges as the new building would encroach on a natural sloping drainage area and playground space would be limited. Option #2 proposed to expand the campus with the acquisition of 12 acres. Option #3 sought to expand the campus with the addition of 21 acres. The Board of Education did not decide on which site plan option they would pursue. The proposed floor plan for the new elementary school called for the building to have 10-second grade classrooms, 10-first grade classrooms, 10 kindergarten classrooms, and 8-pre kindergarten classrooms, plus the CDC and special education classrooms. Each classroom could accommodate up to 20 students. Although the school was designed to be long, architects say the travel or walking distance for students on either end of the building to the shared space (center of the school) would only be 350 feet.</p><p>*Raiden Martin, a Junior at DeKalb County High School, was named President of the Tennessee Future Business Leaders of America.

Founded in 1969, SES has been serving the City of Smithville for 50 years. “In 1969 the City of Smithville purchased what became SES from the McMinnville Electric System. The original board members were John Robert Nixon, Clarence Braswell, John Bill Evins, Dr. W.E. Vanatta, and Bill Maffett. The original board started with a bond issue of $450,000 to begin operation. They retired these bonds and today the system is debt free,” said SES Board Chairman Walter Burton. In fact it was on this date (May 15, 1969) that the original board held its first meeting to organize. In October 2017, SES completed a new substation located on South College Street and named it in honor of Mr. Nixon, who at that time was the longest serving board member and chairman. With the new John Robert Nixon Substation, the City of Smithville now has two electrical power sources. The second substation located on West Main Street continues to be shared by SES, TVA, and Caney Fork Electric Cooperative. Today, Smithville Electric System has more than 2,500 metered customers. The current board of directors are Chairman Walter Burton and members Mayor Josh Miller, Hilton Conger, Sandra Wall, and Jason Murphy.</p><p>*Two prisoners are back in custody after escaping from the recreation yard behind the DeKalb County Jail.

By a vote of 3-2, the aldermen voted in a June special session to increase the city property tax rate by 25 cents per $100 of assessed value and to adopt the new $6.8 million budget for the 2019-20 fiscal year on 1st reading. Aldermen Danny Washer, Shawn Jacobs, and Gayla Hendrix voted in favor. Aldermen Brandon Cox and Donnie Crook voted against it. Second and final reading approval was given later in the month. The 25 cent tax rate increase from the current rate of 64.9 cents to the new rate of 89.9 cents per $100 of assessed value is expected to generate $350,000 in new money for the general fund. The largest project on the table in the general fund is a new police department building. The proposed 7,805 square foot structure would be built on property donated to the city on the north side of the city hall/fire department complex at Don Cantrell Street. The cost of the new facility could be as much as two million dollars to be funded either on a long term note or bond issue. From the start date of construction, projections are the building could be completed possibly within one year. The mayor and aldermen recently met with Wayne Oakley of Studio Oakley Architects, LLC who submitted a bid to design the new police department building for the city at $105,000 and that cost has been included in the new budget as engineering fees. A 2% pay raise has been figured into the budget for city employees who have topped out on the wage scale and funds for employee disability insurance coverage to help protect city employees from loss of income in the event they are unable to work for a period of time due to illness, injury, or accident while off the job. Capital outlay expenditures total $622,100 much of which includes grants for airport easements and clearing and a grant match for sidewalk improvements. Plans are to purchase two used police cars and a 16 foot flat bed trailer for the fire department. Capital outlay expenses for the water and sewer include the purchase of a Kubota trackhoe, trailer, diesel truck, 9 foot dump body, camera system for leak detection, and engineering fees and sewer rehab project construction costs.

The DeKalb County School District will pay SMS $494,184 for the year at a rate of $41, 182 per month. The initial term of the contract runs through June 30, 2020 but the agreement will renew on an annual basis for four- one year renewal periods unless either party provides written notice at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the term. Under the agreement, SMS will provide complete janitorial/custodial services at DeKalb County High School, DeKalb Middle School, DeKalb West School, Northside Elementary, Smithville Elementary, and at the Ernest Ray Education Center. SMS will provide all equipment and supplies. Much of the work will be done after school hours. The company will also provide clean-up following school athletic events. The School District will no longer employ custodians but those who have worked for the school system may apply with SMS and if re-hired could find their pay to be better than what the school system was able to offer. Director of Schools Patrick Cripps said the school system will save about $35,000- $40,000 a year by outsourcing the custodial services and it will relieve the district from having to recruit and retain employees itself.</p><p>*DRiV Inc (formerly known as Federal Mogul Motorparts) was recognized by the Smithville-DeKalb County Chamber of Commerce with a 40th Milestone Award during the Chamber Annual Banquet.

Eight votes were needed for passage. Five commissioners voted in favor but six cast a no vote. Three members, Beth Pafford, Jenny Trapp, and Anita Puckett were absent. Commissioners voting for the tax hike were Sabrina Farler, Dr. Scott Little, Janice Fish-Stewart, Jerry Adcock, and Jeff Barnes. Those voting against were Dennis Slager, Julie Young, Myron Rhody, Bobby Johnson, Matt Adcock, and Bruce Malone. Although they didn’t state their reasons during the meeting, half of the commissioners voting no told WJLE after the meeting they felt the proposed tax hike was too much while the other three said it didn’t go far enough in meeting existing and future needs. Even a couple of commissioners voting yes said they felt the county should do more. Steve Bates, the county’s financial advisor, has warned that the county cannot go another year without more revenue. According to Bates, the county general fund is expected to be in the red by $1,681,933 as of June 30, 2020 if spending goes according to the proposed budget. To balance the budget, the county would have to pull the $1.6 million from the fund balance (cash reserves). Even with a 29 cent tax hike, Bates said the county general fund is still projected to run in the red by $473,132 as of June 30, 2020 if all budgeted funding is spent. However, he added the county could manage and possibly grow out of the deficit as long as spending is kept in check.</p><p>*The Alexandria property tax rate will remain the same for another year but most water and sewer customers there will see an increase in rates. During the regular monthly meeting in June the Alexandria Aldermen adopted on second and final reading the city’s budget ordinance for the 2019-20 fiscal year beginning July 1. Alexandria property owners will continue to pay .7944 cents per $100 of assessed value. The only major pending capital project listed for the year in the general fund is $35,000 for the purchase of a police vehicle. The city was forced to take action on rates affecting its 970 water and 405 sewer customers. Under the new budget, current water and sewer rates will not change for customers inside the city using the minimum up to 2,000 gallons per month. Their water bill will remain at $26.00 plus tax and their sewer at $20.00 per month. But for usage above the minimum, water and sewer customers will pay $10.40 per thousand, up from the current rate of $7.77 per thousand. For example, an inside the city water customer who uses 5,000 gallons per month will see their monthly bill go from $49.31 to $57.20 per month plus tax while bills for sewer customers using 5,000 gallons a month will jump from a current bill of $43.31 to $51.20 per month. Water customers outside the city will pay $34.52 per month (no sewer), up from $28.52 for the minimum plus tax and $12.48 per thousand above the minimum, up from the current rate of $7.77 per thousand. For at least three years Alexandria’s water and sewer fund has lost money operating in the “red” which is in violation of state law. The city was ordered months ago by the state’s water and wastewater financing board to come up with a plan to correct the issue or be subject to the state setting the rates for the utility. In response to the order Alexandria asked the municipal technical advisory service (MTAS) to conduct a rate analysis to essentially give the city guidance on how much rates should be adjusted to bring the utility into compliance. Also in order to comply with the state’s order, Alexandria had to offer a five year plan of action for making capital improvements to the water and sewer system. The MTAS study also covered that including a plan on how the city would pay for it. The city is hoping to obtain funding through a Rural Development Loan, a State Revolving Fund Loan, and a Community Development Block Grant for the needed projects. Pending capital projects planned for the city’s water and sewer fund in the coming year include $12,000 for a sewer plant equipment upgrade and $6,000 for new water meters, the first of a four year (water meter) project. “The water meters are regular read so we are just updating in Zones to help identify areas with water loss and are included at $6,000 per year in our future projects,” said Elizabeth Tetlow, Municipal Financial Officer/City Recorder. Future plans are to upgrade the city’s sewer plant and collection system, a $1,350,000 project and a $30,000 water pump motor upgrade.</p><p>*Repairs began to the Fiddlers Jamboree stage after a storm blew through knocking down the canopy and the beams that supported it.
