By: Dwayne Page</span></p><p>In what could be described as a year of change, local election results, the indictment of a sitting Smithville Mayor, and the death of an off duty Lebanon Police Officer in a traffic accident were the top local stories of 2018.</p><p>Voters elected 10 new members to the county commission and one new school board member. Republican Susan Martin won the Circuit Court Clerk race succeeding 16 year Democratic veteran Katherine Pack who chose not to seek re-election. Republican Danny Hale was elected to succeed one term Republican Road Supervisor Butch Agee who did not seek a second term. In Smithville, Alderman Josh Miller unseated Incumbent Mayor Jimmy Poss.</p><p>A move by Smithville Mayor Poss to put his son Tony Poss on the city payroll without the approval of the aldermen resulted in a Grand Jury Indictment against both of them. During the first day of the new term in July, the DeKalb County Grand Jury returned a sealed indictment against Mayor Poss for Official Misconduct and Theft of Property over $2,500. Tony was also named in the sealed indictment for Theft of Property over $2,500. The cases were presented to the grand jury by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation who began a probe after the issue surfaced in March. Prior to the indictments, the aldermen voted to censure Mayor Poss but stopped short of asking him to reimburse the city for money paid to Tony. The case is set to go to trial July 23, 2019.</p><p>A 28 year old Lebanon Police Officer who lived in DeKalb County lost his life in a tragic accident on March 1. Joseph Bowen was driving home from work in his 2008 Chevy Silverado extended cab pickup when the truck left Highway 70 and went down a rocky embankment before hitting a large tree and plunging into the swift waters of Dry Creek at Dowelltown. The truck was carried a few feet downstream and came to rest partially submerged on its passenger side. A memorial service with full police honors was held in Lebanon on March 5 followed by a procession to his final resting place at Salem Cemetery in Liberty. Firefighters, law enforcement officers, and other emergency services responders stood side by side on Highway 70 and saluted as the hearse bearing Officer Bowen’s body arrived in Liberty.</p><p>The following is a month by month summary of the top stories of 2018.</p><p><strong>JANUARY</strong></p><p>*The body of 66 year old Scott Northrup of Silver Point was recovered at around 11:35 a.m. on Thursday January 11 about 100 yards from where his fishing boat was found Wednesday night, January 10 in the Florida branch area of the lake about a mile across from Floating Mill Access. TWRA Officer Tony Cross said Northrup’s body was found in about 34 feet of water. Sonar and an underwater camera aided TWRA officers and members of the Smithville-DeKalb County Rescue Squad in the search. Northrup. a Tennessee Tech University professor emeritus of chemistry and faculty advisor to the Tech bass fishing team was reported missing Wednesday evening after he failed to return home by 3:00 p.m. from a fishing trip to the lake.</p><p>*Family members of the late Rosa Stokes attended a number retirement ceremony at DCHS, January 19 for Rosa who wore #55 during her years as a Lady Tiger Basketball player from 1979-83. Rosa passed away in 2003 from a heart condition. Raised in Alexandria, Rosa began playing basketball at DeKalb West School for the Lady Bulldogs under Coach Danny Parkerson in elementary school during the mid to late 1970s. Her star shone even brighter at DCHS under Coach Mickey Bilyeu from 1979-83 where she scored over 1,500 points as a Lady Tiger (known as Tigerette at the time) and was named All District, All Upper Cumberland, All Mid-State and Honorable Mention All State. After her playing days at DCHS, Rosa continued her basketball career as a member of the Cumberland University Lady Bulldogs in Lebanon where she made an indelible impact on the program becoming a prolific scorer and rebounder. As a Lady Bulldog, Rosa scored over 1,000 points and grabbed more than 1,000 rebounds. In 2009 she was posthumously inducted into the Cumberland University Hall of Fame. Cumberland plays a tournament in her name each December.

The MVP trophy was presented to Miller by Coach Steve Trapp. “This guy played a lot of football for us this year (2017) as a senior. I don’t think he came off the field a whole lot. He was on special teams, defense, and offense. We put him in as running back in a couple of games. He returned kicks and punts. Last year as a junior he probably had the best defensive back year ever as a DCHS football player but he didn’t have as many opportunities this year because people just wouldn’t throw at him. Last year he was All-State in different areas and pre-season All State this year. He is a tremendous high school football player,” said Coach Trapp. In addition to his MVP trophy, Miller was named Most Outstanding Defensive Back in Region 3 Class 4A. The Tiger football team finished the season in November, 2017 with an overall record of 3-8 and another appearance in the state play-offs.

Members of Bain’s family, coaches, and fellow players joined her for the occasion. Cumberland is a member of the Mid-South Conference affiliated with the NAIA. “The reason I chose Cumberland University was because the school is local and they have a good athletic program and a good nursing program and that is what I plan to major in,” said Kristena. “I believe Kristena is our fourth or fifth athlete from DeKalb County. We have always had good players from DeKalb County High School and we expect the same from her,” said Assistant Cumberland Varsity Coach and Head JV Coach, Stephanie Theall.</p><p><strong>FEBRUARY</strong></p><p>*Kurt Bass was appointed as a member of the DTC Communications Board of Directors in the Temperance Hall exchange, filling the unexpired term of Jimmy Oakley who resigned.

Dr. John Carpenter, Minister of the Smithville First United and the Bright Hill United Methodist Church began the dedication with a prayer and anointing of the new fire truck. Members of the department then officially placed the fire engine into service in what is historically known as a ‘push back.’ The origin of pushing a fire truck into the station dates back to the time of horse drawn equipment. Firefighters had to push the fire pumpers into the fire station because horses were incapable of backing the equipment. Chief Parker said the new Pierce Impel PUC Rescue Pumper, which is a combination fire engine/rescue vehicle,  has taken the place of three vehicles. The department, founded in 1938, officially turned 80 years old on February 3.</p><p>*A 13 year old student at DeKalb County Middle School, was charged with a delinquent act of making threats toward a Middle School teacher.

A student told school staff about the threat toward the teacher. The school staff then advised the School Resource Officer, who then contacted Sheriff Ray.</p><p>*The County Commission voted to ante up more money to give county general and sheriff’s department employees pay raises retroactive to January 1 but a proposal to increase pay for EMS staff under a plan proposed by Second District Commissioner Joe Johnson was not approved. Upset by the move, Johnson resigned from the commission in protest saying he was ashamed of the body’s actions and no longer wanted to be part of this group. Near the end of the meeting, Johnson passed his resignation letter to County Mayor. The county commission adopted pay raises for county general employees according to new 13 tier wage scales. Sheriff’s department staff will get pay raises under a new six tier scale..</p><p>*A 2017 DCHS football athlete plans to continue to his career on the college level. Gage Delape, a senior, signed to play at Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky, the home of the Blue Raiders.

During the regular monthly meeting, the board voted unanimously to seek funding for the construction of a new elementary school for students in pre-kindergarten to 2<sup>nd</sup> grade to replace Smithville Elementary School. Smithville Elementary School, originally built in 1958, now is 70,557 square feet in size, and has a current enrollment of 556 students. A year ago a facilities study by the board’s architect, Upland Design Group, concluded that the school, which has mold and other concerns, should be replaced and repurposed for other uses. The proposed new school, 98,000 square feet, would accommodate 800 students. The total estimated project cost is $19,464,500. Plans are to build the new school (pre-k to 2<sup>nd</sup> grade) adjacent to Northside Elementary School (grades 2-5) on the same property if it is feasible. According to the architect’s facilities study, 15-20 acres would be needed for the project. The Tennessee Department of Transportation also requires a traffic study be done anytime a new school is built near a state highway. Findings of that study as it relates to increased traffic flow and congestion will also be a consideration. If the architect concludes that more land is needed to make the Northside site acceptable for a new school, the board is expected to try purchasing property from an adjoining landowner. Members of the Board said having both Northside and the new elementary school on the same property would make it easier for students to transition from one to the other and it would free up space at Northside. Northside Elementary was built for grades 3-5 but in recent years has had to accommodate three second grade classes due to overcrowding at Smithville Elementary, which is a pre-K to 2<sup>nd</sup> grade school. With a new elementary school, all second graders would again be under one roof.</p><p>*The DeKalb Saints claimed the Championship of the Middle Tennessee Football Conference after beating Fentress County 14-8 at Jamestown.

Trooper Topps then attempted to make a traffic stop. The car pulled over at mile marker 226 but as Trooper Topps was calling in the traffic stop the car took off. Trooper Topps then initiated a pursuit. After the registration was checked it came back as a stolen car out of Metro Nashville. The pursuit continued on I-40 and then onto Highway 70 before crossing into DeKalb County at 11:58 p.m. A DeKalb County deputy joined Trooper Topps in the pursuit at Liberty and Smithville Police Officers set up a road block at the intersection of Congress Boulevard and Broad Street to keep other traffic from crossing while the pursuit was approaching. In Smithville the pursuit turned from Broad Street onto College Street at the bridge then east on Webb Street to South First Street before the car crashed on the property of Dr. Starla Meigs Office only a block off the public square.

We had time to take shelter in a closet. My wife and our grandkid got in one closet and I got in another. We could hear the roar and the wind blew a window out in front of our house just as it hit,” said Randy Campbell. Another barn was destroyed in the same area and a shed was blown down at a residence on Woodbury Highway. Trees were also reported down and across the road on the Old Snow Hill Road.

During the regular monthly meeting at DeKalb West School, the Board of Education voted unanimously to hire Upland Design Group to proceed with a schematic design (site study) of the proposed school to be located next to Northside Elementary School. The cost of the design project is $40,000 to be funded from the Board of Education’s budget. “This will involve some site studies and engineering, everything we need to have some answers for the funding body (county commission) for the pre-k through 2nd grade school so we can get started on that and not deviate from our schedule because we have worked on this (plan to build a new school) over a year and a half. We are anxious to get going and continue moving in a forward direction,” said School Board Chairman W.J. (Dub) Evins, III. By a vote of 8-6, the county commission last month tabled a motion to support the board in proceeding with preliminary work until members of the commission could meet in a workshop with the school board to discuss the project in more detail and possibly other school construction options. Director of Schools Patrick Cripps said the board will be able to provide more details of the project and be in a better position to answer questions of the county commission by bringing in Upland Design to do this design. The study is expected to be completed within 60 days.</p><p>*Family, friends, and fellow teachers paid tribute to the late Karen Blair Jacobs at Northside Elementary School where she taught most of her 30-year career.

During the regular November meeting, the county commission voted 10-4 to award the latest lowest bid for the project to Johnson Builders of Doyle, Tennessee. Their base bid was $160,820 with alternate deducts of $8,000 for work on the parking lot and $4,000 to add insulation to the building. The contractor has 270 days to complete the project. The project has been delayed twice because the lowest bids to construct the facility ($257,000 in May and $197,000 in March) were deemed too high by the previous county commission. That was essentially the same argument posed by commissioners who voted against awarding this bid thinking the fire hall could have been built cheaper. The new fire station at Four Seasons will be the 12th station in the county operated by the DeKalb County Volunteer Fire Department.</p><p>*Ranger Brad Halfacre was named the new Park Manager at Edgar Evins State Park following the recent promotion of former Park Manager, Kenny Gragg, to Middle Tennessee Parks Area 3 Manager.

Nurse Christina Arnold, LPN for Advanced Correctional Healthcare, arrived at the patient’s cell where she evaluated the patient and determined he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. Nurse Arnold, with assistance from Officer Singleton, began CPR.

No one was injured. The cause of the fire is undetermined but apparently started from the upstairs level of the home. According to County Fire Chief Donny Green Nelson’s wife was home at the time when a smoke alarm sounded from upstairs. She also heard popping and cracking noises coming from there.

Judge Cook began the recovery court program for juveniles in 2002.</p><p>*A 28 year old Smithville woman lost her life in a two car crash on Highway 70 at Liberty. Dead is Amanda L. Smith. According to the accident report filed by Trooper Chris Delong of the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Smith and 30 year old Raymond H. Rollins of Smithville were in a white 1998 Ford Mustang traveling west in the eastbound lanes and struck a 2014 Honda Accord, driven by 36 year old Charlie R.
