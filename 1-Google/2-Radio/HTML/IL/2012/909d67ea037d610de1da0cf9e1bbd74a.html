    <p><strong>Spotless</strong> - Shelley Quinnâs new series magnifies the love of God as she takes you on a panoramic journey through redemptionâs story from Genesis through Revelation, delivering an end-time message of righteousness by faith and an intimate picture of the Messiah-Christ through understanding Godâs covenant language.</p>
    <p>A companion book by the same name will also be available from <a href="https://3abnstore.com/" target="_blank">3ABNStore.com</a>. Written in a simple narrative form, this book provides ample Scripture references, features all 28 fundamental beliefs, and includes helpful chapter summaries. Donât miss the series, or the opportunity to add this valuable companion resource to your library!</p>
    <p><strong>Made for Health</strong> - Hosted by RisÃ« Rafferty, this series addresses the underlying health conditions that drive sickness and disease. We tend to ask questions like, âWhat virus?â or âWhat was I exposed to?â However, we should be asking, âWhat made me vulnerable to this?â or âHow can I strengthen myself to fight this better?â Sheâll focus on the unhealthful conditions we can change, and the wrong habits we can correct. Weâll be inspired and motivated to implement practical, simple strategies that can improve our quality of life, because we were all Made for Health!</p>
    <p><strong>Recipes from Russia</strong> â Our first English cooking series produced in our Russian studios will be hosted by 3ABN Russiaâs Executive Director, Julia Outkina, and will feature the tasty and healthy recipes the Lord has given them since they first received the health message during Pastor John Carterâs historic evangelistic series in 1992. Along with the recipes, Julia will share memories of over 30 years of 3ABN Russia. Youâll rejoice as you hear how God provided during the construction of our Russian Evangelism Center, and many other outstanding moments in 3ABN Russiaâs history.</p>

    	<p>These study guides were written by 3ABN Pastoral Department Assistant Manager, Daniel Perrin, who drew from  his long experience as a Bible teacher at a Christian academy.</p>
    	<p>âWriting them has been such a privilege and a blessing,â he says. âMy prayer is that each person who studies them will be guided by the Holy Spirit to other places in Scripture, giving them confidence that God will help them know how to apply the truths they discover.â</p>
    	<p>Each guide has a special QR code on the back that takes readers to related material on our <a href="http://3ABNBibleAnswers.com" target="_blank">3ABNBibleAnswers.com</a> website, or to a five-minute video on each topic. In addition, they take us to programs on the 3ABN+ app and website, as well as free offers like magazines and books that cover the subject more in depth. </p>
    	<p>The first set of 14 Bible Study Guides are now available for a suggested donation of just $7 postpaid in the U.S., and now you can order 10 entire sets for just $25 postpaid in the U.S., as well! Individual lessons can be <a href="https://3abnbibleanswers.com/bible-study/" target="_blank">downloaded for free here</a>â just click on the âattachmentsâ link. For bulk pricing, please call 3ABN at 618-627-4651 or visit <a href="https://3ABNStore.com" target="_blank">3ABNStore.com</a>.</p>
    	<p>Thank you for partnering with 3ABN in evangelism. Because of you, many who are broken, alone, lost, and hurting will discover hope, healing, and transformation through Godâs Word and the power of His Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>Our 3ABN Homecoming camp meeting will be held on our campus September 28 through 30 with the theme of âYou Shall Receive Powerâ (Acts 1:8). Each of us needs the power of a new beginning, the power of prayer, and the power to overcome sin. We all need power to forgive, to endure trials, and to receive the Latter Rain. These are just a few of the topics youâll hear, and weâre really hoping to see you in person!</p>

    <h1 id="3ABN-PRISON">Urgent: Frequency Switch on G19 Satellite</h1>
    <p>3ABN wants you to know about an upcoming switch in frequencies on our G-19 satellite and that we are doing everything we can to make it easy on you if you watch us via satellite!</p>
    <p>This frequency switch <u>will only affect those who watch us on the G-19 satellite</u> over North America, and <u>will not affect anyone else</u> who watches over broadcast stations, the Internet, or on any smart phone or device.</p>
    </>
  ),
  eventDetails: (
    <>
    
    <h4>Who Will Be Affected?</h4>
    <p>Viewers with newer DVB-S2 capable receivers will simply need to rescan, and find 3ABN on our new frequency. Our new location will show up as 3ABN S2.</p>
    <p>If you watch with an older receiver such as the Manhattan and other models, you will need a new receiverâand 3ABN will send you one free of charge! Your new receiver will be <u>preprogrammed, so all you do is âplug and play!â</u> We want to make it as easy and painless as possible for you to make the switch.</p>
    
    <h4>The Advantages are Amazing!</h4>
    <p>With the switch to our new frequency, youâll be able to watch 3ABN in High Definition (HD), and enjoy looking ahead to find the programs you donât want to miss with the new Electronic Program Guide (EPG). This frequency change even helps us to stretch the reach of the gospel, since it will decrease our satellite cost!</p>
    
    <h4>Questions? Need Help?</h4>
    <p>Weâre always here to help you, and want to make this switch as easy as possible. So feel free to call us for help at 618- 627-7677, Monday through Thursday during regular business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time).</p>

    <h1>Passing of Elder Jim Gilley</h1>
    <p>It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Pastor Jim Gilley, who served as president of Three Angels Broadcasting Network from 2007 through 2015. Pastor Gilley was a beloved husband, father, and leader in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</p>
    <p>As we grieve his loss, we take comfort in the words of 1 Thessalonians 4:14, which reminds us that we do not âsorrow as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.â Jimâs faith in Jesus Christ gave him the blessed hope of the resurrection. </p>
    <p>Please join us in praying for Pastor Gilleyâs wife, Camille, and all of his family. May Godâs grace and peace be with them during this difficult time and may His promise in Isaiah 25:8 to âswallow up death forever,â and âwipe away tearsâ comfort their hearts.</p>

Each day, we go through the countless letters we receive, answering their questions, giving them encouragement, and sending them free books, magazines, and Remnant Study Bibles by the hundreds.

    <p>In addition, 3ABNâs Hard Drive for Prisons Initiative provides a way for them to watch Christ-centered programming by loading a special device with over 3,900 customized programs that can be added to their TV channels.</p>

    <p>For over 60 years, it has been very difficult to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ in Cuba. But even as our 3ABN Latino Network grew, we always longed to reach that island nation and the millions who need to hear the three angelsâ messages of Revelation 14!</p>
    <p>We prayed for a miracleâand God opened a door by making 3ABN Latino programming available to over 11 million viewers in every Cuban city on <em>El Paquete</em> (âThe Packageâ)âtheir most popular source of TV programming!</p>

    <p><em>El Paquete</em> is a weekly selection of popular foreign TV series, music, films, and other programs available for download onto memory sticks or hard drives for a small fee. Currently, thereâs no other method of video distribution, since all the local television stations are run by the government. But although it was developed to distribute secular programs, we see how the Lord is using <em>El Paquete</em> to reach millions!</p>
    <p>We praise God for the opportunity to be <em>the very first Christian television programming to ever be allowed into Cuba, </em>and we praise Him for the precious souls that have already been baptized! Every day, the seeds of the gospel are being planted, and we can count on an abundant harvest. Soon, 3ABN will open a call center in Cuba with a local number that will connect them with a nearby church for Bible studies. Truly, the Lord is holding the doors wide open for the salvation of millions of souls!</p>

    <h1>New Eyes of the Ancients Book</h1>
    <p>3ABN Books has just published, <i>Through the Eyes of the Ancients: The Books of Moses</i> by Dr. R. Dean Davis. Based on the popular column he wrote for many years in the 3ABN World magazine, this book covers the familiar Old Testament stories from the perspective of the ancient Hebrews, bringing fresh insights and revelations about the character of our loving God.</p>
    </>

    <p>âWritten in a heart-warming and condensed story form, <i>Through the Eyes of the Ancients</i> is an inspirational and instructional guide that unveils how the original Hebrew audience interpreted the books of Moses,â says author and 3ABN television host Shelley Quinn. âDean Davis points the way by acquainting us with ancient Hebrew customs, expressions, and literary style. As we follow stories of the gradual spiritual growth of the patriarchs, we begin to better understand the heart of a tender, loving, personal God and His everlasting covenant of graceâthat revelation can draw us closer to God.â</p>
    <p>Bill Knott, editor of the <i>Adventist Review</i> magazine, says, âDean Davisâs fifty-plus years of mission service, pastoral care, and classroom teaching have coalesced in this volume to make available to thousands of readers what only a few Old Testament scholars know. The writing is clean and clear; the insights are fresh and vivid. In a word, this study of the Books of Moses is <i>accessible</i>.â</p>

    <p>âWhile this booklet is not an exhaustive study,â he adds, âit will introduce and explain the issues and orchestrators of the final showdown. And ultimately, it will make you aware that only you can decide your fate.â</p>

    <p>3ABN Dare to Dream has just begun broadcasting to a potential audience of 45 million homes in Nigeria and other West African nations covered by Freeview Africa, a satellite service provider that delivers free-to-air and premium channels using Satview Network. </p>
    <p>âThis is an innovative approach to satellite programming,â says Moses Primo, 3ABNâs Director of Broadcasting and Engineering. âInstead of charging subscribers a monthly fee for programming, they charge the networks, instead, and keep the programming free for those who watch. If you multiply each home by an average number of people who live there, then you quickly realize how many millions of people now have access to 3ABNâs Christ-centered programming!</p>
    <p> âThis is far more affordable than our previous satellite coverage,â Moses adds, âand because of our faithful 3ABN supporters, countless millions of Africans are now receiving the good news of salvation through 3ABNâs Dare to Dream Network every day.â</p>

    <h1>Reaching Beyond the Internet</h1>
    <p>In 1984, when Danny Shelton was impressed by God to âbuild a television station that would reach the world,â only satellite transmissions made that remotely possible; but with Godâs blessings, just two years later, 3ABN was available on satellite over all of North America. </p>
    </>
  ),
  eventDetails: (
    <>
    <p>In the following years, the Lord made it possible for people to watch over the air as 3ABN built dozens of television stations across the United States, and by 2000, Three Angels Broadcasting Network was available on satellite and the Internet on every inhabited continent of the word! </p>
    <p>Despite these technology advances, there are still certain areas where our satellite signals do not reachâmost notably, on the island nations of the South Pacific. Even the cost of Internet access is too high in those remote locations, so we prayed and waited on the Lord for an answer.</p>
    <p>Expanding 3ABNâs coverage has been a special burden for Moses Primo, our Director of Broadcasting and Engineering, and his fervent prayers were answered when the Lord impressed him with the idea of the <b>Interless</b> set top box! Developed with South Pacific Island viewers in mind, this small, light, and portable box provides thousands of programs on an internal memory making it perfect for viewers anywhere in the world who cannot receive our satellite signal, or where Internet costs are prohibitive. </p>
    <p><b>Interless</b> provides a whole new way to watch programming by 3ABN and other ministries. Simply plugging it into a TV allows viewers to choose any of the thousands of Adventist television programs stored in its internal memory. The Interless box is also ideal for residents in aged care facilities, rental properties, prisons, and anywhere else satellite or Internet access are unavailable. The programs can be played on demand, and as a special bonus, when an Internet connection is available, viewers can watch nearly every Seventh-day Adventist TV channel through the built-in <b>mySDAtv</b> app!</p>
    <p>3ABN Australia has begun a campaign to send <b>Interless</b> boxes to the South Pacific islands, where they can be used for themed talks to small groups or for sermons in small churches with no regular speaker. The cooking programs can be used at church or at home to introduce friends to the benefits of vegan cooking, and the excellent childrenâs content can help little ones learn about Jesus. </p>
    <p>âGod has opened the doors and provided the material,â says John Malkiewycz, 3ABN Australiaâs General Manager. âWe are beginning to send these <b>Interless</b> boxes to viewers in the South Pacific islands and other areas, and we pray they will be used as another powerful evangelistic tool to win many more souls to Jesus.â</p>

This weekly selection of TV series, soap operas, music, films, and other programs are available to download onto memory sticks or hard drives for a small fee, and can then be played back on their TV sets at home,â explains John Dinzey, 3ABNâs General Manager.</p>

    <p>âThere is no other method of distribution,â he adds, âsince all the local television stations are run by the government. And although it was developed to distribute secular programs, I marvel at how the Lord is using it to reach millions who are hungry for the gospel!â </p>
    <p>Chaplain Hernell Hernandez, our 3ABN Latino representative in Cuba, is thrilled. âI thank the Lord that He has opened these doors,â he says, âbecause now I have the hope that the gospel can be preached in my native country of Cuba!â Each month, he travels to Cuba with fresh programming and maintains a good relationship with those who distribute it. </p>
    <p>At their request, 3ABN Latino adds public service announcements to each program, urging Cuban viewers to conserve electricity and water, recycle plastics and cans, and use precautions to avoid spreading COVID-19. âWe are also providing a downloadable PDF book each month to âThe Packageâ subscribers,â John Dinzey adds. âWeâve made the Ellen White books, <i>Steps to Christ</i>, and <i>The Ministry of Healing</i> available, and soon weâll be offering them the Spanish version of 3ABNâs booklet, <i>COVID-19: Whatâs Next?</i></p>
    <p>âThis is a marvelous opportunity, and we are taking full advantage of it because we donât know when things will become more difficult,â John concludes. âWhatever we can do, we need to do now, and the Lord will surely bless!â</p>
