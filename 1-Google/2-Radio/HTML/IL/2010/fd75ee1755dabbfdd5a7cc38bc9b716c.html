          <h4 class="blue-hb">JOE OâBRIEN</h4>
          <p>Joe OâBrien was raised a Catholic. But at the age of nineteen, he broke with tradition and began a twenty-two year search for a church that taught the Bible, the whole Bible. When he was introduced to the Seventh-day Adventist Church he set out to disprove their doctrine. In his quest for truth he was astonished to find how the Holy Spirit had blessed this church. The Seventh-day Adventist Church provided answers to questions no other church could answer. Today he shares these Bible truths with all who are willing to listen. Joeâs wife, Nancy, works for 3ABNâs Planned Giving and Trust Services Department and their daughter, Kalie and husband Andrew Saunders are finishing their Masterâs Degrees in Global Development Administration from Andrews University. Joe and his family came to 3ABN in 1999.</p>
